Abstract

We introduce novel computational models for
modeling semantic bleaching, a widespread
category of change in which words become
more abstract or lose elements of meaning,
like the development of arrive from its earlier
meaning ‘become at shore.’ We validate our
methods on a widespread case of bleaching in
English: de-adjectival adverbs that originate
as manner adverbs (as in awfully behaved)
and later become intensifying adverbs (as in
awfully nice). Our methods formally quantify
three reﬂexes of bleaching: decreasing similar-
ity to the source meaning (e.g., awful), increas-
ing similarity to a fully bleached prototype
(e.g., very), and increasing productivity (e.g.,
the breadth of adjectives that an adverb modi-
ﬁes). We also test a new causal model and ﬁnd
evidence that bleaching is initially triggered in
contexts such as conspicuously evident and in-
sanely jealous, where an adverb premodiﬁes a
semantically similar adjective. These contexts
provide a form of “bridging context” (Evans
and Wilkins, 2000) that allow a manner adverb
to be reinterpreted as an intensifying adverb
similar to very.

Introduction

1
Developments in computational semantics and
availability of large diachronic corpora have re-
newed interest
in studying historical semantic
change. Recent work has moved away from doc-
umenting and qualitatively categorizing types of
changes (Br´eal, 1964; Stern, 1931) to focus on
detecting semantic shifts (Gulordava and Baroni,
2011; Rosenfeld and Erk, 2018; Frermann and
Lapata, 2016; Mitra et al., 2014; Kulkarni et al.,
2015), distinguishing gradual linguistic drifts from
cultural ones (Hamilton et al., 2016a) and as-
sessing laws of change (Hamilton et al., 2016b;
Dubossarsky et al., 2017; Xu and Kemp, 2015;
Ramiro et al., 2018; Luo and Xu, 2018).

Building off prior work, we propose the ﬁrst
computational study of semantic bleaching, one
of the most widespread changes in word mean-
ing. Work in historical linguistics characterizes
bleaching as an abstraction or loss of some initial
elements of meaning, such as in the example ar-
rive, which has broadened from ‘become at shore’,
or amazing, which has undergone a change from
‘stupefying’ to ‘great’. However, we know very
little about how this change happens as a quantiﬁ-
able and continuous process. For example, can we
measure to what extent a bleached word continues
to bear its root meaning? How much of the mean-
ing of “awefulness” does awfully have, and to what
extent does awfully now mean very? Finally, the
fundamental question of what drives bleaching re-
mains open.

Answering these questions requires a way to
model the nuances of semantic bleaching sepa-
rately from general semantic shifts. Thus, our
work asks the following:

Q1: Can we build computational models of the
bleaching process that match known semantic re-
ﬂexes of bleaching?

To answer this question, we develop methods
for quantifying three known reﬂexes of bleaching
from the theoretical literature on semantic change:
loss of original lexical meaning, gain of bleached
target meaning, and increasing productivity. We
focus on the case of English de-adjectival adverbs
(awfully nice, insanely delicious), which origi-
nally have a manner meaning derived from the se-
mantics of their root adjective and later bleach into
intensifying adverbs (or intensiﬁers) (Tab. 1). We
choose this case of bleaching as it represents an
open class of semantically diverse adverbs that ex-
perience exceptionally rapid change and speaker
innovation (Bolinger, 1972; Peters, 1994).1.

1Though he focuses on synchronic properties of degree
words, Bolinger (1972, 18) observes: “[Intensiﬁers] afford

Table 1. Examples of the bleaching phenomenon: de-
adjectival adverbs in their original, manner usage and
in their bleached, intensiﬁer usage.

Next, we apply our methodology for model-
ing bleaching to answer open questions concern-
ing how bleaching happens over time:

Q2: Can bleaching be explained in terms of re-
analysis, by which certain contextual factors lead
to one interpretation being favored over another?
Q3: If bleaching is a form of reanalysis, what
are the contexts that trigger this re-interpretation?
We use the same semantically diverse set
of bleaching de-adjectival adverbs to formulate
and test hypotheses pertaining to these questions
(Study 2, Sec. 4), building on previous diachronic
work on intensiﬁers that have focused on a single
word (Lorenz (2002), Macaulay (2006), Beltrama
and Bochnak (2015), Tagliamonte (2008)). In par-
ticular, we hypothesize that a high semantic simi-
larity between an adverb and the adjectives that it
initially modiﬁes is a crucial contextual factor that
triggers the reanalysis of manner adverbs into in-
tensiﬁers. This criterion (exempliﬁed by colloca-
tions such as conspicuously evident, terribly grue-
some) is what allows a manner adverb to be inter-
preted as an intensiﬁer in the ﬁrst place.

2 Methods for modeling bleaching
We translate three known reﬂexes of seman-
tic bleaching from the literature—loss of lexi-
cal meaning; gain of intensiﬁer meaning;
in-
creased productivity—into relationships between
word embeddings and n-gram parse context. For
our n-gram data, we use the English ﬁction por-
tion of the Google Books English n-grams cor-
pus (Lin et al., 2012) and for the historical word
embeddings, we use the HistWords dataset trained
on the same portion of the n-gram dataset (Hamil-
ton et al., 2016b). The full corpus spans the years

a picture of fevered invention and competition it would be
hard to come by elsewhere [...] They are the chief means
of emphasis for speakers for whom all means of emphasis
quickly become stale and need to be replaced.”

1800 to 1999 but we restrict our temporal range to
1850 to 1999, inclusive, due to data sparsity. We
test two different sets of HistWords embeddings:
Word2Vec (W2V) representations and SVD rep-
resentations. All data are aggregated to the granu-
larity of decades, yielding 15 decades total.

2.1 Similarity of adverbs to very (SIMVERY)
As a manner adverb bleaches into an intensify-
ing adverb, we expect the meaning of the ad-
verb to grow more similar to the meaning of
very, the prototypical example of a completely
bleached intensiﬁer (Peters, 1994). We measure
this similarity via the cosine similarity between
the HistWords embedding for an adverb and the
embedding for very, both retrieved for a given
decade. The bleached status of very is empiri-
cally veriﬁed in the embedding space:
the self-
similarity between consecutive decades is compa-
rable to words expected to change extremely little
over time, such as determiners, numerals, and pro-
nouns (the, two, three, four, them, they, us, etc.)
(Pagel et al., 2007).

2.2 Similarity of adverb to original lexical

meaning (SIMLEX)

As a manner adverb like awfully bleaches into an
intensiﬁer, its meaning diverges from its root ad-
jective’s lexical meaning of “awfulness.” We for-
malize this intuition of a bleaching adverb’s di-
vergence from its lexical meaning as the average
cosine similarity of an adverb to a set of lemmas
(L) related to its lexical meaning (eq. 1). We con-
structed these lemma sets by retrieving WordNet
(Miller, 1998) synonyms for the root adjective and
supplementing these with additional synonyms ac-
cording to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED)
(Simpson et al.) (Tab. 2).

where L is a lemma set of lexical meanings and

tween an adverb and a lemma lk in L.2
2.3 Productivity of adverb (BREADTH)
As an adverb bleaches, we expect to see greater
productivity, i.e., an increase in the variety of the
adjectives that it modiﬁes. For example, we expect
to see terribly modifying a greater range of senti-
ment adjectives over time. We suggest two dis-
tinct ways to quantify this semantic breadth. The
ﬁrst is type diversity (TYPEDIV)—the number of
types modiﬁed—which is shown in Bybee (1995)
to be important in determining productivity. The
second is BREADTH, which we measure as nega-
tive cosine similarity of the adjectives, to capture
how semantically similar the set of modiﬁed ad-
jectives is. The more similar the adjectives mod-
iﬁed by an adverb are to each other, the less se-
mantically broad they are. This more general ap-
proach is useful since an adverb might modify a
larger number of distinct adjectives while becom-
ing more restricted in the meanings of adjectives
that it modiﬁes.

We extract all adjectives modiﬁed by an adverb
for a given decade from the Google Syntactic n-
grams corpus (Goldberg and Orwant, 2013). To
calculate a single value for similarity among many
adjectives, we subset the top 50 adjectives ranked
by log odds, then take the grand average of all the
pairwise similarities between each distinct adjec-
tive type (eq. 2). We also weight each pairwise
similarity by each adjective’s odds of being modi-
ﬁed. The BREADTH B of an intensiﬁer I at time t
can be expressed as:

B(I, t) = − (cid:88)

sim(ai, aj)o(ai)o(aj)

(2)
where AI,t is the set of all adjectives modiﬁed by
an intensiﬁer I at time t, sim(·,·) is the cosine
similarity between two words, and o(·) is the odds
of an adjective being modiﬁed by an adverb.

2To increase the robustness of this metric, we restricted
lemmas in L to those whose embeddings remained relatively
stable over time by verifying that their self-similarities over
successive decades did not differ signiﬁcantly from a highly
stable word set composed of determiners, numerals, and pro-
nouns (t = 8.2e-01, p = 0.85).

3 Study 1: Do our methods capture

bleaching?

We hypothesize that our methods can be used
to distinguish adverbs undergoing bleaching into
intensifying adverbs from non-bleaching control
adverbs. In particular, we expect to see signiﬁ-
cant correlations among the set of intensiﬁers be-
tween each metric and time in the following di-
rections (Tab. 3) after ﬁtting linear regressions on

metric over time (as the dependent variable) and time

To test these predictions, we introduce a set
of bleaching intensiﬁers and a frequency-matched
control set of non-bleaching adverbs. We ex-
pect to see signiﬁcantly increasing similarity to
very (SIMVERY), decreasing similarity to origi-
nal meaning (SIMLEX), and increasing productiv-
ity (BREADTH) over time for intensiﬁers, and we
expect that the slopes over time of these metrics
are signiﬁcantly greater for intensiﬁers than for the
control adverbs.

3.1 Datasets
For both the intensiﬁer and control sets, we re-
strict to de-adjectival adverbs (also known as ly
type adverbs).3 We sample these de-adjectival ad-
verbs from lexical classes of adjective roots identi-
ﬁed by Bolinger (1972) and supplement these with
synonyms from WordNet (Miller, 1998). The re-
sult is a set of 250 intensiﬁers, shown partially in
Table 4. (See Appendix A for the full set.)

Our control set consists of 178 frequency-
matched adverbs sampled from the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) (shown partially in Tab. 5,
see Appendix B for the full set).4 We obtained

ness at random from either the W2V or SVD embeddings.

3.2 Comparison of BREADTH to TYPEDIV
To determine whether or not BREADTH is inde-
pendent from TYPEDIV (the number of adjective
types modiﬁed by an adverb), we compute Spear-
man correlation coefﬁcients between the metrics
for individual adverbs as well as a single correla-
tion between BREADTH and TYPEDIV averaged
across all adverbs. We ﬁnd that there are no sig-
niﬁcant correlations between average TYPEDIV
and average BREADTH, nor do we ﬁnd signiﬁ-
cant correlations between the two metrics within
individual adverbs, indicating that our weighted
BREADTH measure captures differences in pro-
ductivity independent from the number of types
that an adverb modiﬁes. In fact, 200 of the 250
intensiﬁers in our dataset show a decrease in the
number of types they modify within the last 5
decades of our data, but an increase in BREADTH.

3.3 Study 1 Results
We computed the 4 metrics (SIMVERY, SIMLEX,
BREADTH, and TYPEDIV) on the intensiﬁer and
control adverbs described in Section 3.1 over the

14 decades from 1850 to 1990. As a reminder,
SIMVERY measures an adverb’s average semantic
similarity to very and SIMLEX measures an ad-
verb’s average semantic similarity to its root ad-
jective meaning (e.g., completely to {full, entire,
whole, ...}). Both BREADTH and TYPEDIV mea-
sure the collocational freedom of an adverb, with
the latter taking into account only the type di-
versity of adjectives that the adverb modiﬁes and
the former also incorporating the semantic simi-
larity of those modiﬁed adjectives to each other.
We then ﬁt linear regressions with each bleach-
ing metric as the dependent variable and time
as the independent variable.5 We take the natu-
ral log of BREADTH so that values are linear af-
ter weighting by adjective frequencies. We also
compute each bleaching metric separately with
Word2Vec (W2V) and SVD embeddings, expect-
ing the strength and direction of the correlations to
be unaffected by the choice of embedding.

The 10 most and least bleached intensiﬁers by
each metric using W2V embeddings for 1990 are
shown in Tab. 7; examples showing increasing
BREADTH over the period 1850-1990 are shown
in Tab. 6. A visual of increasing BREADTH is
shown in Fig. 1.

The results of our regressions somewhat sup-
port our predicted temporal correlations (Fig. 2).
As a caveat, we note that the increasing size of
the syntactic n-grams corpus over time likely bi-
ases BREADTH, since a larger corpus has more
contexts for each word, thus potentially inﬂating
the strength of the correlation with time. While
weighting BREADTH by each adjective’s likeli-
hood of being modiﬁed may mitigate this bias to
an extent (since each likelihood is expected to de-
crease as corpus size increases), we recognize that
future work should seek more robust forms of nor-
regressions using ordinary least
squares models in the StatsModels Python module (Seabold
and Perktold, 2010).

icant (p<1e-05), but only when computed using
W2V embeddings.

For the control set, we ﬁnd that there are no sig-
niﬁcant correlations for SIMLEX computed using
either embedding type (p>0.50), which matches
our predictions. Nor do we ﬁnd signiﬁcant corre-
lations for SIMVERY when computed using SVD
embeddings. However, we do ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
positive slope (p<1e-06) for SIMVERY+W2V, in-
dicating that the control adverbs in our dataset
are also becoming more similar to very over
time. Nevertheless, the slope over time is still sig-
niﬁcantly greater for intensiﬁers than control ad-
verbs (t = 3.1, p<1e-02).

Finally, the correlation for BREADTH is signiﬁ-
cant for both intensiﬁers and control when com-
puted using W2V embeddings as well as using
SVD embeddings (p<1e-63, p<1e-05), suggest-
ing that our current metric for change in produc-
tivity might be heavily dependent on corpus size.
While we did not ﬁnd any correlations between
BREADTH and TYPEDIV, we ﬁnd that the lat-
ter measure of productivity also shows signiﬁcant
trends of increase for both intensiﬁers and con-
trol (again, likely due to increasing corpus size).
However, we ﬁnd that the size of the slope for

tives that are modiﬁed by insanely has expanded over

The signs of the slopes match our predictions
for all metrics and across embedding types for the
intensiﬁer set. Moreover, the strength of the cor-
relation is signiﬁcant for SIMVERY (p<1e-01) as
well as for BREADTH (p<1e-4) when computed
using both W2V and SVD embeddings. For SIM-
LEX, the strength of this correlation is also signif-

than control (t = 4.28, p<1e-04), indicating that
this metric can identify a bleaching adverb given a
control set of non-bleaching adverbs.

3.4 Discussion
We ﬁnd that the combinations SIMVERY+SVD
and SIMLEX+W2V successfully distinguish be-
tween bleaching and non-bleaching adverbs,
yielding signiﬁcant slopes over time for the for-
mer and no signiﬁcant slopes for the latter. Sur-
prisingly, SIMVERY+W2V shows a signiﬁcant in-
crease over time for both intensiﬁers and control,
despite the fact that the principal meaning differ-
ence between the two sets is the new meaning of
intensiﬁcation that only the bleaching adverbs ac-
quire. However, we note that this metric is still
useful for identifying bleaching adverbs when a
control set of non-bleaching adverbs is deﬁned,
since the size of the slope is signiﬁcantly larger for
the former. We ﬁnd that BREADTH does not work
in distinguishing bleaching from non-bleaching
adverbs, most likely due to its dependence on
corpus size, though possibly also because it cap-
tures changes that are not due strictly to bleach-
ing (such as metaphorical extension, though we do
not investigate this suspicion here). However, we
ﬁnd that TYPEDIV (just as SIMVERY+W2V) does
work in the setting of a control set being available,
as the size of the slope is signiﬁcantly greater for
intensiﬁers compared to control adverbs.

It is also possible that SIMLEX may show some
bias toward adverbs that are less morphologically
transparent with respect to their root—for exam-
ple, we see that sorely, especially, and decidedly
are among the 10 most bleached intensiﬁers iden-
tiﬁed by SIMLEX in Tab. 7. We hope to explore
reﬁnements to SIMVERY6 and our two productiv-
ity measures (BREADTH and TYPEDIV) in future
work that may better distinguish between bleach-
ing and non-bleaching adverbs even without a con-
trol set readily available.

4 Study 2: Testing a causal theory
Ultimately, we are interested in modeling bleach-
ing in order to test hypotheses concerning how a
change like awfully behaved to awfully nice took

6We perform the same analyses with a modiﬁed version of
SIMVERY that measures the average cosine similarity of an
adverb to {very, really} but ﬁnd that the results are slightly
poorer in distinguishing bleaching from non-bleaching.

place. In particular, we hypothesize a reanalysis-
driven account of this change:

H1: When an adverb begins to modify adjec-
tives that are semantically similar to itself, the ad-
verb begins to be re-interpreted as an intensiﬁer.

We now turn to the logic behind our hypothesis

and the predictions made by our theory.

4.1 A theory of reanalysis-driven bleaching
For our causal theory, we adopt the framework
of reanalysis as in work by Bybee et al. (1994),
Hopper and Traugott (2003), and Evans and
Wilkins (2000). In these works,
interpretations
that initially arise out of pragmatic enrichment
become conventionalized over time due to regu-
larly occurring contexts that provide support for
the enriched interpretation. Following Evans and
Wilkins (2000), we refer to these supporting con-
texts as “bridging contexts.”

In the case of the reanalysis of a manner ad-
verb into an intensiﬁer, we hypothesize that the
bridging context crucially involves the premodiﬁ-
cation of an adjective, A, that denotes a semanti-
cally similar property. To develop an intuition for
how this criterion can give rise to the contextual
ambiguity very A, we refer to examples (1-3) be-
low from The Corpus of Historical American En-
glish (COHA) (Davies, 2010-).
In (1-3)(b), the
adverb and modiﬁed adjective denote independent
properties: abnormalness is independent from be-
ing developed, awfulness is independent from be-
ing behaved, etc. However, in (1-3)(a), both ad-
verb and adjective are associated with a shared se-
mantic property such that the adverb reiterates the
modiﬁed adjective in a way that is analogous to
intensiﬁcation.

time while control adverbs show no trend (b). Intensiﬁers show decreasing W2V similarity to their original lexical
meanings (SIMLEX) over time whereas control adverbs show no trend (c). Neither intensiﬁers nor control show a
signiﬁcant trend with SIMLEX using SVD embeddings (d). Intensiﬁers and control adverbs both show increasing
productivity over time measured as BREADTH (e-f) and as raw type diversity, but intensiﬁers show signiﬁcantly
greater increases over time compared to control for TYPEDIV (g). Error bars on raw values show 95% bootstrap

7related to a single property p does their combi-
nation yield a synergy such that language users
can infer the meaning ‘very p.’ As these bridg-
ing contexts increase in number, there is eventu-
ally enough evidence for users to infer the adver-
bial meaning ‘very’ even in the absence of the ini-
tial bridging context. In this way, the adverb be-
comes increasingly free to modify new adjectives
without injecting its literal meaning as in (1-3b),
effectively becoming bleached. Thus, the predic-
tion we will test in order to evaluate our theory is
as follows:

• P1. Rate of bleaching (for an adverb, over
a given decade) is positively correlated with
the similarity between an adverb and the ad-
jectives modiﬁed by the adverb (henceforth
SIMADJMOD).

4.2 Setup
We calculate rates of bleaching by taking the ﬁrst
derivative of extent of bleaching with respect to
time, according to eq. 3:

(both intensiﬁers and control), rate of bleaching
over a given decade D = [t0, t1) is positively
correlated with SIMADJMOD at t0 (the seman-
tic relatedness between an adverb and adjectives
modiﬁed at t0), implying that at a given time, ad-
verbs that modify semantically similar adjectives
will bleach faster into intensiﬁers over the follow-
ing decade. Lines of best ﬁt from ordinary least
squares regressions are shown in Fig. 3.

Moreover, what distinguishes intensiﬁers from
non-bleaching control adverbs in our data is the
variable SIMADJMOD: averaged across 1850-
1990, SIMADJMOD is higher among the set of in-
tensiﬁers compared to the set of control adverbs
(Fig. 4). We further performed paired t-tests and
found that SIMADJMOD is signiﬁcantly higher
for intensiﬁers than for the control adverbs (t =
7.3e+1, p<1e-20).7

where B(K, t) is rate of bleaching for an adverb
K at time t according to one of the three bleaching
metrics (SIMVERY, SIMLEX, BREADTH), giving
us three different time series for rates of bleaching
per adverb.

Since we are interested in examining how rate
of bleaching over a given decade correlates with
SIMADJMOD, the semantic relatedness between
an adverb and the adjectives it modiﬁes, we com-
pute this variable (for a given adverb and decade)
according to eq. 4:

SIMADJMOD(K, t) =

where AK,t is the set of all adjectives modiﬁed by
an adverb K at time t. Essentially, we take the
average cosine similarity between an adverb and
the adjectives it modiﬁes, weighted by the odds of
each adjective being modiﬁed (for a given decade).

4.3 Results
We present results using rates of bleaching com-
puted from SVD embeddings (see Appendix C
for results based on W2V embeddings). We ﬁnd
that our prediction is borne out: across all adverbs

Figure 3. The more semantically similar an adverb is to
the adjectives that it premodiﬁes (the greater SIMAD-
JMOD), the greater its rate of bleaching according to
SIMVERY (a), SIMLEX (b) and BREADTH (c). Rates
are computed using SVD embeddings and data are
for all adverbs (intensiﬁers and control) at all years.
Shaded areas show 95% conﬁdence intervals.

7We also found the proportion of adjectives modiﬁed by
an adverb relative to verbs to be signiﬁcantly higher among
intensiﬁers vs. control (t = 4.4, p<1e-04).

8We also show the utility of our methodology in
evaluating explanatory hypotheses regarding how
bleaching into intensiﬁers happens. We found that
there is empirical evidence to support a reanalysis
story: an adverb’s tendency to modify adjectives
that are semantically similar to itself is positively
correlated with its subsequent rate of bleaching.
This pathway of change is intuitive, as it is collo-
cations such as awfully disgusting and clearly ob-
vious that invite the re-interpretation of an adverb
as a marker of emphasis, similar in function to an
intensiﬁer.

In future work, we are interested in reﬁning
BREADTH by normalizing for increasing corpus
size as well as trying different weightings to cap-
ture the landscape of adjectives that an adverb
modiﬁes.
It also remains an open question how
generalizable our ﬁndings concerning bleaching
of manner adverbs into intensiﬁers are. It would
be interesting to see if other examples of adverb
bleaching, such as the development of “modera-
tors” (slightly, hardly, etc.) can be modeled as re-
analysis. Another under-explored example of ad-
verb bleaching concerns the development of maxi-
mizing adverbs into reinforcing adverbs. Beltrama
and Staum Casasanto (2017) study the change un-
dergone by totally, but the larger tendency remains
unexplored.

Furthermore, among English adverbs, there are
many other semantic factors that have potential ef-
fects on bleaching. For example, Sweetser (1989)
suggests that words which explicitly highlight se-
mantic facets of the source domain that cannot be
mapped onto the target domain are unlikely candi-
dates for grammaticalization as they require “ac-
tive suppression” of the foregrounded meanings.8
It would be interesting to study the bleaching of
intensiﬁers with this question in mind—for exam-
ple, the adverb vanishingly occurs in contexts like
vanishingly small and vanishingly rare which are
well-suited for reanalysis, but for vanishingly to
be understood as a generic intensiﬁer would also
require suppression of its meaning of smallness.

anonymous reviewers for their helpful feedback.

8For example, the verb lumber is an unlikely candidate
for undergoing the change from motion verb to tense marker
because it explicitly encodes rate and manner of motion, com-
pared to a verb like go.

more similar adjectives compared to control adverbs.

5 Discussion
In this work, we show how word embeddings and
n-gram parse context can be used to model the se-
mantic bleaching of manner adverbs into inten-
siﬁers.
In particular, we empirically show that
the bleaching of adverbs is associated with intu-
itive changes that have not previously been eval-
uated on large scale data:
loss of root meaning,
gain of target meaning, and increasing productiv-
ity. While our diachronic metrics may be biased
by increasing corpus size over the years in our
study, we ﬁnd that the metrics SIMVERY, SIM-
LEX, and TYPEDIV still show signiﬁcantly larger
increases for the intensiﬁers compared to the con-
trol set. Thus, even though increasing corpus size
presumably affects both wordsets equally, we have
evidence to suggest that there are signiﬁcant addi-
tional increases for intensiﬁers that may capture
the fact that they are bleaching. We recommend
that future researchers apply these metrics in con-
junction with a control set (matched in frequency)
when using other corpora subject to changes in
size over time so that they may test for these sig-
niﬁcant relative differences between the bleaching
and control words.

We also ﬁnd that these two classes of adverbs
can be distinguished in the absence of a control set
when modeled using SIMLEX, an adverb’s sim-
ilarity to its root adjectival meaning. This metric
also has the beneﬁt over BREADTH of operational-
izing a fundamental feature of bleaching that is not
shared by other kinds of semantic change (e.g.,
metaphorical extension), as well as being gen-
eralizable (unlike SIMVERY) to cases of bleach-
ing beyond manner adverbs becoming intensiﬁers.
Thus, we recommend this metric to researchers
interested in modeling bleaching more generally.

embeddings-based rates of bleaching

Figure 5. The more semantically similar an adverb is
to the adjectives that it premodiﬁes, the greater its rate
of bleaching by all three metrics. Rates are computed
using HistWords W2V embeddings and data are for all
adverbs (intensiﬁers and control) at all years.
