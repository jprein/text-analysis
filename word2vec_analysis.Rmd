# training parameters
# dim: dimensionality of the word vectors. usually more is better, but not always, especially with small data
# type: skip-gram (slower, better for infrequent words) vs cbow(fast)
# window: for skip_gram usually around 10, for cbow around 5
# hs: the training algorithm: hierarchical softmax (better for infrequent words) vs negative sampling (better for frequent words, better with low dimensional vectors)
# sample: subsampling of frequent words: can improve both accuracy and speed for large data sets /useful values are in range 0.001 to 0.00001)
