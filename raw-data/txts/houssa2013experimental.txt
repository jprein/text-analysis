Abstract 

Using an experimental approach, our study examined the differentiated effects on pre-schoolers‘ social cognition 
of two short-term social information processing (SIP) and Theory of Mind (ToM) training sessions dealing with 
emotions  and  beliefs.  The  links  between  ToM,  SIP,  and  social  adjustment  or  externalizing  behavior  were 
examined.  47  pre-schoolers  took  part  in  a  pretest  session  involving  cognitive,  socio-cognitive  and  social 
adjustment  measures.  The  direct  socio-cognitive  measures  involved  tasks  assessing  emotion  recognition,  ToM 
emotions,  ToM  beliefs  and  social  problem-solving.  The  teachers  filled  out  a  personality  questionnaire  and 
parents completed the Theory of Mind Inventory, a social adjustment scale and the CBCL. Secondly, they were 
allocated  at  random  to  two  experimental  groups  (ToM  training  or  SIP  training)  or  to  a  control  group.  In  the 
experimental groups, each of three children, short training sessions were given using educational materials. Free 
play  was  offered  in  the  control  group.  Finally,  all  children  took  part  in  a  post-test  session.  Our  results  showed 
significant improvement in ToM emotions for the ToM training group, in ToM beliefs for the SIP training group, 
and  in  social  problem-solving  for  both  experimental  groups,  and  some  transfer  learning.  In  pretest,  significant 
positive  correlations  were  obtained  between  social  cognition  measures  and  individual  characteristics,  and 
between  social  cognition  measures  and  social  adjustment.  Significant  negative  correlations  were  observed 
between social adjustment and externalizing behavior, and between social adjustment and emotional reactivity. 
This study provided some guidelines for formulating a medium-term training program in social cognition aimed 
at pre-schoolers at risk of displaying externalizing behavior disorders. 

Keywords: theory of mind, social information processing, training, pre-schoolers 

1. Introduction 

Several  theories  have  been  developed  regarding  the  development  of  social  cognition  in  children,  including  the 
Theory  of  Mind  (ToM)  model,  which  uses  a  developmental-structural  approach,  and  the  social  information 
processing (SIP) model, which takes a functional approach. Social cognition abilities develop primarily between 
4 and 6 years of age; in this period, children‘s behavior and thought processes are still flexible (Webster-Stratton, 
Reid,  &  Beauchaine,  2011).  In  general,  strong  social  cognition  abilities  are  likely  to  result  in  adequate  social 
adjustment and allow good interaction (Yeates, Dennis, Rubin, Taylor, Bigler, Gerhardt, & Vannatta, 2007). 

In  reference  to  ToM  concepts,  pre-schoolers  develop  the  ability  to  understand  their  own  and  other  people‘s 
mental states, to take other people‘s perspective, to infer what they know, believe, or feel, and consequently to 
behave in a well-adjusted way in various social situations (Denham & Burton, 2003; Deneault & Ricard, 2013; 
Denham, Zinsser & Bailey, 2011; Flavell, 1999; Lane, Wellman, Olson, Labounty & Kerr, 2011; Wellman, 1991). 
In other words, children who are good at identifying and understanding other people‘s emotions should interact 
successfully  and  develop  harmonious  social  relationships.  Moreover,  when  children  are  able  to  infer  and 
understand knowledge, intentions, and beliefs, they can take other people‘s cognitive perspective and adjust their 
own  behavior  as  a  consequence.  According  to  this  structural-developmental  approach,  maladjusted  children 
display  deficits  in  social  cognition  and  their  coordination  of  social  perspectives.  In  ToM  studies,  deficits  in 
at-risk  children  are  postulated  in  the  understanding  of  mental  states,  notably  of  causes  and  consequences  of 
emotions  (Hughes,  Dunn  &  White,  1998)  and  of  beliefs  (Fahie  &  Symons,  2003;  Walker,  2005).  Moreover,

deficient emotional recognition has also been reported (Blair & Coles, 2003; Marsh & Blair, 2008).   

In  reference  to  SIP  models  (Crick  &  Dodge,  1994),  as  they  mature,  children  become  more  able  to  think  about 
social problems, and their ability to solve them gradually leads to increasingly efficient social reasoning (Dodge 
&  Pettit,  2003;  Fontaine  &  Dodge,  2009).  These  last  authors  describe  five  steps  in  SIP:  encoding  of  other 
people‘s social cues, interpretation of social cues, clarification of goals, response access and response decision. 
According  to  this  functional  approach,  maladjusted  children  display  biases  during  difficult  or  problem-solving 
situations: deficits are observed in each of five steps of SIP when they are faced with social interactive situations 
(Crick  et  al.,  1994;  Dodge  &  Crick,  1990;  Dodge  et  al.,  2003;  Fontaine  et  al.,  2009;  Mize  &  Pettit,  2008). 
Deficits in social problem-solving are also postulated (Pettit, Dodge & Brown, 1988).   

In summary, deficits in social cognition may lead to the development of externalizing behavior disorders (EB) in 
children, causing them to be perceived as ―hard to manage‖ (Crick et al., 1994; Runions & Keating, 2007). 

With a view to preventing EB and improving social skills, studies have been conducted to test the efficiency of 
training in ToM or social problem-solving in pre-schoolers (Melot & Angeard, 2003) and children with intellectual 
disabilities  (Swettenham,  1996)  or  with  autism  (Begeer,  Gevers,  Clifford,  Verhoeve,  Kat,  Hoddenbach  &  Boer, 
2011;  Feng,  Lo,  &  Tsai,  2008;  Gevers,  Clifford,  Mager  &  Boer,  2006;  Hadwin,  Baron-Cohen,  Howlin,  &  Hill, 
1996;  Ozonoff  &  Miller,  1995;  Parsons  &  Mitchell,  1999;  Silver  &  Oakes,  2001).  Some  studies  have  reported 
positive effects from this socio-cognitive training. Children‘s performance in ToM tasks improved after training in 
understanding emotions (Walker, 2005) and after training in understanding false beliefs in diverse conditions, such 
as conversations about false beliefs, explanations of correct response, differentiated immediate feedback on their 
performance or discussion about events in false belief scenarios (Amsterlaw & Wellman, 2006; Appleton & Reddy, 
1996;  Clements,  Rustin  &  McCallum,  2000;  Howlin,  Baron-Cohen  &  Hadwin,  2011;  Kloo  &  Perner, 
2003).Furthermore,  an  improvement  in  SIP  was  obtained  after  training  in  which  children  talked  about  concepts 
arising from stories of peer interaction and did related activities (Bhavnagri & Samuels, 1996), and after training 
that included role-playing games, group interaction and puppets (Shure & Spivack, 1982). SIP training primarily 
takes the form of medium-term training (e.g., Webster-Stratton, 2000). 

Table 1 presents the pre- and post-test measures used by authors who reported some positive effects of ToM or SIP 
training. Studies involving successful training in social cognition highlight the need for explanations during training 
in order for learning to occur. Giving children ToM or SIP training has a noticeable impact. This effect has usually 
been tested with pre-schoolers in several short sessions (up to 12), individually or in groups (of up to 11 children). 

In order to better evaluate the impact of these training programs, there is a need for valid assessments of ToM and 
SIP in pre-schoolers who have limited attention and verbal skills, using visual materials. New methods make this 
possible, notably ToM emotions and ToM beliefs tasks (Nader-Grosbois & Thirion-Marissiaux, 2008, 2011a), the 
ToM  task  Battery  (Hutchins,  Prelock,  &  Chace,  2008),  and  the  Theory  of  Mind  Inventory  questionnaire  (ToMI, 
Hutchins,  Prelock,  &  Bonazinga,  2010).  For  SIP  abilities,  there  is  the  Social  Problem  Solving  Task  (RES, 
Barisnikov,  Van  Der  Linden,  &  Hippolyte,  2004),  the  Social  Information  Processing  Interview  (SIP-I,  Ziv  & 
Sorongon, 2011) illustrated by pictures, and the Schultz Test of Emotion Processing - Preliminary Version (STEP-P, 
Schultz, Ambike, Logie, Bohner, Stapleton, VanderWalde, Min & Jetkowski, 2010), illustrated by videos.

2. Objectives   

Firstly, this study aims to test whether performance in social cognition tasks can be improved by means of short 
stimulations;  that  is,  to  assess  the  differentiated  effects  of  two  types  of  experimental  training  on  the  level  of 
social  cognition  skills  in  pre-schoolers.  No  study  has  ever  combined  structural-developmental  and  functional 
approaches in order to investigate the respective impacts of one-shot ToM training and of one-shot SIP training 
on  ToM  and  SIP  abilities,  taking  potential  transfer  learning  into  consideration.  We  predicted  that  (1a)  children 
who  received  ToM  training  would  have  significantly  better  performance  in  ToM  post-test  measures  compared 
with  their  pretest  abilities,  and  that  (1b)  children  who  received  SIP  training  would  have  significantly  better 
post-test  performance  in  SIP  measures  compared  with  their  pretest  abilities.  As  regards  the  potential  transfer 
effect, we predicted that children who received ToM training  would improve their SIP abilities in post-test and 
children who benefited from SIP training would improve their ToM abilities in post-test (1c). 

The  second  objective  was,  with  reference  to  a  heuristic  model  of  social  skills  (Nader-Grosbois,  2011a),  to 
explore  the  links  between  ToM,  SIP  abilities  and  adults‘  perception  of  children‘s  social  adjustment  and 
externalizing behavior in the  pretest session,  taking into account individual characteristics (developmental age, 
personality).  We  hypothesized  positive  links  between  ToM  and  SIP  abilities  and  developmental  age  (2a)  and 
specific factors of personality (2b), as well as between social cognition and social adjustment (2c); however, we 
predicted  negative  links  between  ToM  and  SIP  abilities  and  externalizing  behavior  (2d),  and  the  ‗emotionally 
reactive‘ score (2e). 

3. Method 

3.1 Participants 

The participants were 47 children (23 boys and 24 girls), aged between 3 years 9 months and 5 years 6 months 
(M=  4.7  years,  SD  =  4.9).  They  were  recruited  in  Belgian  French-speaking  schools.  The  teachers  identified 
children  who  met  the  inclusion  criterion  of  elementary  comprehension  and  production  of  spoken  French.  The 
exclusion criteria were developmental delay, intellectual disabilities or behavioral disorders. 

3.2 Instruments 

3.2.1 Differential Scales of Intellectual Efficiency – Revised (EDEI-R, Perron-Borelli, 1996). 

These  scales  were  used  in  the  pretest  session  to  check  that  children  had  verbal  and  non-verbal  developmental 
ages  between  3  years  6  months  and  5  years  6  months,  in  order  to  be  included  in  the  sample.The  verbal 
developmental age was obtained by means of scores in two scales: ―knowledge‖ and ―social understanding‖, and 
the non-verbal developmental age by means of ―practical adaptation‖. As regards the validation, the correlations 
calculated  between  the  raw  scores  of  all  scales  were  high:  they  varied  between  .47  and  .88;  half  of  the  scores 
were .70 or below. 

3.2.2 ToM Emotions Tasks (Nader-Grosbois & Thirion-Marissiaux, 2011a). 

(1)  Preliminary  task  of  facial  emotional  expression  (FEE)  recognition.  The  four  basic  emotions  (joy,  sadness, 
anger, and fear) were illustrated by pictures and had to be recognized by the child. 

(2)  Causes of emotions task.  This task  involved  four scripts all beginning  ―Three friends go on a picnic in the 
forest‖,  with  two  illustrations.  Each  script  (with  a  third  picture)  ended  differently,  to  elicit  an  appropriate 
response according its emotional quality: joy (friends eat picnic); sadness (picnic canceled because of rain); fear 
(threatening  dog  is  approaching  the  picnic);  or  anger  (picnic  is  ruined  by  two  friends).  For  each  script,  the 
experimenter first read out the script (the protagonist‘s face was left blank), and the participant was then asked to 
assign an emotion to the protagonist by pointing to the most appropriate of the four FEE. The  response to each 

 

141

Vol. 2, No. 1; 2014 

script  was  scored  between  0  and  1.5  points  according  to  the  participant‘s  justification  (0  =  false  FEE,  no  or 
incoherent justification; 0.5 = false FEE, coherent justification; 1 = correct FEE, no or incoherent justification; 
1.5 = correct FEE, coherent justification). The maximum score was 6 points. 

(3)  Consequences  of  emotions  task.  Four  scripts  were  illustrated  by  two  pictures,  presenting:  joy  (receiving  a 
gift); sadness (pet‘s death); fear (imagining monsters in bedroom at night); and anger (conflict between friends). 
The  experimenter  explained  the  beginning  of  the  script  (two  pictures).  Then,  the  child  was  asked  to  infer  the 
protagonist‘s  behavior  and  to  finish  the  script  by  choosing  one  of  three  pictures  corresponding  to  socially 
adjusted behavior, socially maladjusted behavior or neutral behavior. The child justified the choice. The response 
to  each  script  was  scored  between  0  and  1.5  points  according  to  the  participant‘s  justification  (0  =  socially 
maladjusted  or  neutral  behavior,  non-justified  or  incoherent  justification;  0.5  =  socially  maladjusted  or  neutral 
behavior,  coherent  justification;  1  =  socially  adjusted  behavior,  non-justified  or  incoherent  justification;  1.5  = 
socially  adjusted  behavior,  coherent  justification).  The  maximum  score  was  6  points.  The  two  ToM  emotions 
tasks were scored out of a combined total of 12 points. 

A  recently  created  computer  version  of  these  tasks  was  used  in  this  study.  The  factor  analysis  revealed  two 
subscales  (causes  and  consequences)  which  were  found  in  the  original  version.  Cronbach‘s  alpha  was  .57,  and 
the test-retest stability was highly significant for the two subscales (between .56 and .68). 

3.2.3 ToM Beliefs Tasks (Nader-Grosbois & Thirion-Marissiaux, 2011a). 

These five tasks estimated the understanding of beliefs. 

(1) Deception skills test (Oswald & Ollendick, 1989). The experimenter hid an object in one hand, and the child 
then did likewise. The experimenter noted whether or not the child really hid the object. 

(2)  Change  of  representation  task  (Flavell,  Everett,  Croft  &  Flavell,  1981).  The  experimenter  was  sitting 
opposite the child with a picture of a turtle placed between them, and the child was asked: ―What do you see?‖ 
and ―What do I see?‖   

(3) Appearance-Reality task (Flavell, 1986). Three substitute objects were presented: (a) a flashlight in the shape 
of a mobile phone, (b) an eraser in the shape of a peanut in its shell and (c) a telescope looking like a glue stick. 
The child was asked two questions: ―If you look at this object and you don‘t touch it, what does it look like?‖ 
and ―What is it really?‖ 

(4) Unexpected content task (Perner, Leekam & Wimmer, 1987). The child was shown a Smarties box and the 
experimenter  asked:  ―What  is  inside  the  box?‖  The  child  then  opened  the  box  and  found  pencils.  The  pencils 
were returned to the box and the child was asked: ―What did you think was in the box before  it was opened?‖ 
and ―What will your mother think is in the box if she has not seen inside it?‖ 

(5)  Change  of  location  task  (Wimmer  &  Perner,  1983).  This  corresponds  to  the  ―Max  and  the  transfer  of 
chocolate‖ task. 

These ToM beliefs tasks were scored out of a total of 5 points (1 point for each task).   

For  the  validation,  the  inter-judge  agreement  was  very  high  (agreement  percentage  between  99%  and  100%; 
Cohen‘s kappa between .98 and .99; Pearson correlation coefficient between .99 and 1). No difference between 
the test and retest session was observed. 

3.2.4 Social Problem-solving Task (RES, Barisnikov et al., 2004). 

This task assesses children‘s capacity to judge whether or not other people‘s social behavior is appropriate and the 
extent to which their judgment refers to conventional and moral rules. Participants were shown 14 items illustrated 
by  14  pictures  in  which  a  character  displayed  appropriate  or  inappropriate  social  behavior  in  everyday  social 
situations. Three questions were asked. (1) ―What is happening in the picture? What do you think? Is he/she doing 
something that is good or not good?‖ (identification of socially adjusted or maladjusted behaviour, maximum score 
= 2); (2) ―Can you show me what is good/not good?‖ (identification of the target behavior, maximum score = 1). (3) 
―Why is it good/not good?‖ (justification, maximum score = 7). The maximum score for all items is 140. 

The inter-judge agreement was 98% (Hippolyte, Iglesias, Van der Linden & Barisnikov, 2010). 

3.2.5 Theory of Mind Inventory – French version (ToMI, Hutchins et al., 2010; translated by Houssa, Mazzone 
& Nader-Grosbois, in press). 

This  questionnaire  measures  caregivers‘  perception  of  children‘s  ToM  abilities.  It  presents  39  statements  (e.g., 
―My  child  understands  that  people  can  lie  to  purposely  mislead  others‖).  Caregivers  indicated  their  degree  of 
agreement  with  each  statement  by  placing  a  vertical  mark  along  a  continuum  ranging  from  ―definitely  not‖  to 
―definitely.‖ The score for each item ranged from 0 to 20.

Vol. 2, No. 1; 2014 

The validation of the French version matched the original version. Cronbach‘s alpha was .94, and the coefficient 
of test-retest stability was very significant (r = .86) (Houssa et al., submitted). 

3.2.6 Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000). 

The CBCL includes items to assess behavioral and emotional problems in children. This measure generates two 
factors:  externalizing  and  internalizing  behaviors.  In  this  study,  we  used  the  externalizing  behavior  score 
(EB),corresponding  to  the  sum  of  scores  in  the  subscales  ―Aggressive  behavior‖  (19  items)  and  ―Attention 
problems‖(5  items).We  also  used  the  subscale  for  ―Emotional  reactiveness‖  (ER),  which  is  an  internalizing 
behavior. Caregivers had to report on a Likert scale whether the behavior was never, sometimes, or often/always 
observed. The higher the score, the higher the level of EB or ER. 

The scales had Cronbach‘s alphas of between .63 and .86 and a test-retest reliability of .85.   

3.2.7  Bipolar  Rating  Scales  based  on  the  Five  Factor  Model  (EBMCF,  Roskam,  De  Maere-Gaudissart  & 
Vandenplas-Holper, 2000). 

This  questionnaire  measures  the  child‘s  personality  in  reference  to  five  factors  (extraversion,  agreeableness, 
conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness). The 25 items are completed by caregivers (or teachers), by 
choosing between two opposite adjectives on a Likert scale.   

The validation was carried out with 321 children. The factor analysis  confirmed the 5 factors, with Cronbach‘s 
alphas  of  between  .70  and  .93.  The  coefficients  of  test-retest  stability  were  highly  significant  (between  .66 
and .93 for teachers, between .80 and .89 for caregivers).   

3.2.8 Social Adjustment Scales (EASE, Hughes & Soares-Boucaud, 1997) 

This  measures  adults‘  perception  of  children‘s  socio-emotional  adjustment.  It  includes  items  relating  to  social 
skills  (non-ToM)  and  items  dealing  with  perspective-taking  abilities  (ToM).  It  was  completed  by  caregivers 
and/or teachers. For each item, they had to indicate whether the behavior was non-existent or rare (0), frequent (1) 
or usual (2). 

The  validation  was  carried  out  on  327  pre-schoolers.  The  two  subscales  had  good  internal  consistency 
(Cronbach‘s alpha was .77 for the ToM scale and .79 for the non-ToM scale). Authors have found a significant 
regression  between  the  ―ToM  scale‖  and  verbal  developmental  age  (r  =  .22)  (Comte-Gervais,  Giron, 
Soares-Boucaud, & Poussin, 2008). 

4. Procedure 

Information  letters  and  a  consent  form  for  the  child‘s  participation  were  given  to  parents  via  their  teachers. 
Participants  were  tested  in  a  quiet  room  at  school  or  at  the  Institute  of  Psychological  Sciences.  In  the  pretest 
session, four tests were administered individually in two sessions of 45 minutes: EDEI-R scales, ToM emotions 
and beliefs tasks and the RES. Then, children were randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups (ToM 
or  SIP  groups)  or  to  the  control  group.  They  participated  in  a  training  or  free  play  session  for  45  minutes  and 
finally, they were assessed in a posttest session for 45 minutes, by means of ToM emotions and beliefs tasks and 
RES (see Figure 1). There was an interval of 1-4 days between pre- and post-tests.

4.1 Training in Experimental Groups 

In the experimental groups, children received brief stimulation involving one of the forms of training, in a quiet 
room. They were trained in subgroups of three, as this allowed them to help one another complete or correct their 
answers, which could result in socio-cognitive conflict helping their thoughts. Furthermore, there was a speaking 
slot, which ensured that each child had speaking time. 

Open-ended questions were asked about the presented situations in order to prompt discussion, and feedback was 
provided after each response, as well as an explanation of the correct or expected response. Correct answers were 
given  positive  feedback  and  incorrect  responses  were  corrected  with  an  explanation  (differentiated  immediate 
feedback on the performance in the task). The experimenter also reminded the participant of the general principle 
related  to  the  task  (such  as  the  social  rules  that  could  be  applied  in  this  social  situation);  that  is  for  the 
generalization  of  the  knowledge.  Training  was  carried  out  by  a  female  experimenter.  Finally,  in  both  training 
sessions, different types of materials were used  – evidence-based resources and educational materials – as well 
as different styles of resources (―unanimated‖ and ―animated‖). 

Table 2 summarizes the training in social cognition in reference to ToM and SIP models.  Appendixes A and B 
detail, for ToM training and SIP training respectively, the type of resources, the functions  in which training was 
given (mental states or social situations), the presented situations, and the timing.

4.1.1 ToM Training Experimental Group 

The  goal  was  to  stimulate  the  comprehension  of  emotions  and  of  beliefs,  based  on  the  program  conceived  by 
Howlin  et  al.  (2011),  who  described  five  developmental  levels  of  these  abilities.  As  detailed  in  Table  2,  we 
stimulated children to infer mental states in the protagonist, to talk about his or her emotions and beliefs etc. The 
progression of this training reflects the five levels. 

Before the session, each child received an envelope  with 4 pictures of  faces representing the expression of the 
four  basic  emotions.  We  asked  the  children  to  show  the  sad  face,  then  the  happy  face  etc.  Correct  recognition 
was a necessary condition in order to begin the training. 

The first part used the pictures and program design of Howlin et al. (2011). Children had to say or point to the 
protagonist‘s emotion, and at the end of each story they had to reply to some questions about the protagonist‘s 
emotions,  desires  and  beliefs  and  to  justify  their  choice.  If  the  child  gave  a  correct  reply,  the  experimenter 
reinforced  and  consolidated  this  reply.  By  contrast,  if  the  reply  was  incorrect,  then  the  experimenter  gave  the 
correct reply and the reason.   

The second part comprised the presentation of cartoon extracts (e.g., Snow White) where the protagonist was in 
a situation eliciting the emotions of joy, fear, sadness, anger, or had a false belief. The purpose was to train the 
participants  to  understand  causes  and  consequences  of  emotions  and  some  aspects  of  ToM  beliefs,  such  as

reporting another person‘s false belief. 

The third part featured the game ―Mental Simil‖ (Juarez Monfort, Sanchez, & Monfort, 2009) presenting a series 
of pictures illustrating stories featuring false beliefs. The experimenter showed pictures one by one and told the 
story. The children had to explain and talk about the featured false beliefs. 

4.1.2. SIP Training Experimental Group 

As explained in Table 2, the SIP training used two sets of materials: video-based SIP illustrating social situations 
from  the  ―Schultz  Test  of  Emotion  Processing-Preliminary  Version‖  (STEP-P,  Schultz  et  al.,  2010)  and  stories 
illustrating  social  situations  with  bears  from  the  ―Social  Information  Processing  Interview  for  Pre-schoolers‖ 
(SIPI-P , Ziv et al., 2011). 

The  STEP-P  includes  three  aspects  of  the  SIP  model:  ―emotions‖,  ―provocation‖,  and  ―goal  acquisition‖.  The 
emotions category contains videos that present scenarios in which either an emotion-eliciting event occurs or a 
child  displays  emotion-related  behavior.  The  provocation  category  contains  videos  that  present  scenarios  in 
which  a  child  receives  provocation  of  ambiguous  intent.  The  goal  acquisition  category  contains  20  videos  that 
present  scenarios  in  which  children  attempt  to  attain  a  goal  (Schultz  et  al.,  2010).  Each child  in  the  SIP  group 
watched 3 videos from each category. At the end of each video, the experimenter questioned the child to check if 
he/she understood what had happened and asked if he/she could explain what had occurred. Then, the child tried 
to identify the emotion  felt by each protagonist, indicate if one of them acted expressly, and predict the verbal 
and non-verbal behavior of the protagonists. Finally, the experimenter asked each child to ―take the place of the 
protagonist‖  and  asked  if  they  had  had  a  similar  experience  themselves,  and  how  they  reacted/would  have 
reacted in this situation, as a way of generalizing the concepts involved.   

In addition two stories from  the SIPI-P illustrating critical  social situations  with  teddy bears  were presented to 
children.  The  experimenter  told  the  story  and  asked  the  children  questions  about  it.  Each  child  answered  the 
questions,  which  were  a  way  of  checking  the  child‘s  comprehension  of  the  facts.  Children  had  to  judge  a 
protagonist‘s potential reactions as  well-adjusted or maladjusted. The experimenter asked  the children to say if 
they had had a similar experience themselves, to talk about emotions felt in the past, and to consider what could 
be done to manage them.   

4.2 Control Group 

Control  children  participated  in  a  play  session  in  groups  of  3  for  45  minutes.  Children  played  a  snakes  and 
ladders game. The experimenter was the same as for the experimental groups.

One-way  ANOVAs  revealed  no  significant  difference  between  the  three  groups  for  sex,  chronological  age, 
developmental age, personality, social cognition or social adjustment. Consequently, the  groups were equivalent 
in the pretest session.

For  the  pretest  session,  a  one-way  ANOVA  showed  no  difference  between  groups  for  ToM  emotions  (F(2)  = 
2.99), ToM beliefs (F(2) = 2.08), or RES (F(2) = .35). For the post-test session, a one-way ANOVA showed no 
difference between groups for ToM emotions (F(2) = .435), ToM beliefs (F(2) = .058), or RES (F(2) = .302). 

5.1.1 ToM Emotions 

A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted on the ToM emotions performance with pretest/post-test score as a 
within-group  factor  and  as  a  between-groups  factor.  This  analysis  revealed  no  significant  pre-post  effect,  F(1) 
=  .455,  and  a  significant  pre-post  X  group  interaction,  F(2)  =  3.82,  p<  .05.  A  one-way  ANOVA  with  pre-post 
difference between groups revealed that the significant interaction between pre-post and groups was due to the 
fact  that  the  improvement  in  the  ToM  group  was  significantly  greater  than  in  the  control  or  SIP  group.  This 
pre-post comparison was significant in the ToM group but not in the two other groups.   

5.1.2 ToM Beliefs 

A  repeated  measures  ANOVA  was  conducted  on  the  ToM  beliefs  scores,  showing  a  significant  main  pre-post 
effect, F(1) = 8.32,  p< .01, and a significant pre-post  X group interaction,  F(2) = 3.43, p< .05. The significant 
main  pre-post  effect  was  further  analyzed  by  one-tailed  paired  t-tests.  The  pre-post  comparison  was  only 
significant  in  the  ToM  group,  and  there  is  a  tendency  for  the  SIP  group  (p  =  .11),  in  contrast  with  the  control 
group. 

5.1.3 RES 

A  repeated  measures  ANOVA  showed  only  a  significant  main  pre-post  effect,  F(1)  =  11.60,  p  =  .001.  The 
pre-post  X group interaction  was not significant,  F(2) = .437, ns. Post-hoc Bonferroni indicated that all  groups 
showed a significant improvement on the RES task (see Table 4).   

Although there is no significant difference between groups for the pre/post-test differences, the tendency showed 
that the ToM group (pre/post-test difference = 7.63) increased more than the control (pre/post-test difference = 
4.25) or SIP (pre/post-test difference = 4.67) group for the RES task. 

Finally, as shown in Table 4, in the control group, children had a tendency to achieve a lower score in post-test 
than in pretest for ToM beliefs and ToM emotions. They only improved their score in the RES. However, in both 
experimental  groups,  there  are  at  least  tendencies  to  improvement  between  pretest  and  post-test  for  each  test 
(ToM emotions, ToM beliefs, and RES) in both groups.

Significant correlations (from p< .05 to p = .000) are obtained between social cognition measures and individual 
characteristics, social cognition measures and social adjustment, and social cognition measures and ER, but also 
within the social cognition measures, between social adjustment and EB, and between social adjustment and ER. 
Positive  significant  correlations  were  obtained  between  global  developmental  age  on  the  one  hand  and  ToM 
emotions,  ToMI,  and  RES  on  the  other  hand.  Furthermore,  ToM  emotions  were  positively  correlated  with 
―conscientiousness‘,  while  ToM  beliefs  were  positively  correlated  with  ―agreeableness.‖  Positive  significant 
correlations were also obtained between social adjustment on one hand and ToM emotions, ToMI, and RES on 
the other hand. Within the social cognition measures, ToM emotions and ToMI, as well as ToM beliefs and RES, 
were  positively  and  significantly  linked.  Finally,  ToM  emotions  and  ToMI  were  correlated  negatively  and 
significantly to ER, and the social adjustment measure was negatively and significantly linked with EB and with 
ER. Moreover, the negative correlation obtained between ToM emotions and EB was nearly significant (r = -.32, 
p = .054) 

6. Discussion 

6.1 Training Effects 

As  predicted  (1a,  1b),  this  experiment  demonstrated  positive  effects  of  one-shot  training  sessions  in  social 
cognition.  We  showed  that  training  with  feedback  and  explanations  improved  children‘s  performances  in  the 
social cognition direct measures. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that ToM training led 
to a significant rise in ToM and SIP performances, while SIP training improved performance in RES and in ToM 
beliefs (tendency). The training not only improved performances in the trained skills, but also induced a transfer 
of learning to other social cognition tasks (prediction 1c). The transfer effect showed that training in one aspect 
of  social  cognition  could  influence  children‘s  understanding  of  other  aspects  of  the  mind.  The  mutual  transfer 
effects between ToM and SIP tasks mean that, at least with those tasks, there is a causal link between ToM and 
SIP.  As  Kloo  and  Perner  (2003)  argued,  the  transfer  effect  on  the  socio-cognitive  tasks  indicates  that  children 
learned something that went beyond the immediate context of the task.

The ToM training may have enabled children to interpret visual illustrations and to take the protagonist‘s point of 
view, which can be very useful for the SIP step. Conversely, the SIP training  may have allowed participants to 
―feel what the protagonist might feel, how he might react…,‖ which can be useful for understanding causes and 
consequences  of  emotions.  Although  the  children  in  the  SIP  group  were  trained  to  generate  an  alternative 
appropriate  response,  they  talked  about  the  protagonist  experiencing  the  emotions  in  order  to  justify  their 
answers. Conversely, children in the ToM group probably used social problem-solving when they saw an extract 
from  a  cartoon  about  a  child  who  was  scared  or  sad,  because  the  children  had  to  talk  about  potential 
consequences of emotions and what the protagonist could do to stop that particular feeling.   

The transfer effect may be explained by the fact that, in both groups, the experimenter used similar techniques of 
exchanges  including  inductive  questions,  explanation  of  expected  responses  and  immediate  differentiated 
feedback.  Furthermore,  children  were  placed  in  groups  in  order  to  create  opportunities  for  ―socio-cognitive 
conflicts‖  between  children  that  could  help  bring  about  an  evolution  in  their  mental  representations  of  social 
situations. In the case of wrong answers, each child was able to benefit from the help of another child or from 
corrections, feedback, or explanations of alternative or right answers. 

One surprising result was that SIP training did not significantly enhance RES score compared with other groups. 
Contrary  to  expectation,  the  SIP  group  was  not  the  one  that  displayed  the  greatest  improvement  in  RES. 
Although  there  was  no  significant  difference  between  groups  for  the  pre/post-test  differences,  the  tendency 
showed that the ToM group increased more than the control or SIP group for RES. One explanation for this may 
be  the  learning  effect,  because  even  the  control  group  obtained  significantly  better  scores  in  post-test  than  in 
pretest.  However,  the  ToM  group  had  a  tendency  to  improve  more  than  the  other  two  groups.  This  could  be 
explained by the fact that children seemed to enjoy the ToM training more than the SIP training—materials and 
exercises were probably more attractive and varied—which meant that they were more attentive and motivated. 
Another  explanation  could  be  that  the  SIP  training  always  used  critical  or  ambiguous  social  situations  or 
provocation, while the RES assessment included both appropriate and inappropriate situations. 

6.2 Links between ToM, SIP and Individual Characteristics, Social Adjustment 

Preliminary social cognition measures correlated positively together. We found positive significant links between 
ToM emotions and ToMI (as found by Houssa et al.,  in press), and between ToM beliefs and RES. This result 
could  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  understanding  of  beliefs  and  social  problem  solving  are  probably  more 
cognitive aspects of social cognition than ToM emotions. As Deneault and Ricard (2013) suggest, ―emotion‖ is 
an affective mental state, while ―belief‖ is more of a cognitive mental state. 

Firstly, as expected (2a), correlations showed that social cognition aspects are positively linked to developmental 
age (except ToM beliefs). As several authors have shown (e.g., Schultz et al., 2010; Wellman & Liu, 2004), this 
means  that,  as  cognitive  capacities  (verbal  and  non-verbal  intellectual  level  of  efficiency)  increase,  children 
acquire abilities in social cognition.   

Secondly, as expected (2b), some specific personality factors correlated positively with social cognition abilities. 
Conscientiousness was positively correlated to ToM emotions, while agreeableness was positively correlated to 
ToM  beliefs.  This  means  that  the  more  children  are  perceived  as  having  a  high  level  of  conscientiousness,  the 
stronger  their  skills  in  ToM  emotions.  And  the  more  children  are  perceived  as  having  a  high  level  of 
agreeableness, the higher their skills in ToM beliefs.   

Thirdly,  as  predicted  (2c),  the  social  cognition  measure  (except  ToM  beliefs)  correlated  positively  with  social 
adjustment.  The  children  who  have  better  abilities  in  social  cognition  are  better  adjusted  socially  (Denham  & 
Burton, 2003; Houssa et al., submitted; Nader-Grosbois, Houssa & Mazzone, 2013).   

Fourthly,  we  hypothesized  (2d)  that  social  cognition  measures  would  be  negatively  correlated  to  externalizing 
behavior,  but  the  negative  correlations  obtained  between  ToM  emotions  and  EB  were  not  quite  significant.  As 
our sample was composed of normally developing pre-schoolers, without behavior problems, this low correlation 
may  be  due  to  the  variance  in  EB  score.  The  negative  correlation  may  be  significant  with  children  who  have 
more variance in their externalizing behavior score (e.g., Nader-Grosbois et al., 2013). 

Fifthly,  as  expected,  we  found  a  significant  negative  correlation  between  social  cognition  or  social  adjustment 
measures,  and  social  maladjustment  measures.  This  means  that  if  children  were  perceived  as  socially 
well-adjusted, they displayed few externalizing behavior problems, and conversely, if children were perceived as 
having a lot of externalizing behavior problems, they were also perceived as more socially maladjusted (Ladd & 
Troop-Gordon,  2003;  Nader-Grosbois  &  Fiasse,  2011b,  p.286).  Furthermore,  we  expected  (2e)  negative  links 
between ToM emotions, ToMI, and emotional reactivity. This means that if children had good scores in ToM, or 

 

148 

Journal of Education and Training Studies 

 

Vol. 2, No. 1; 2014 

were perceived by their parents as having good abilities in  ToM, they  were perceived as having a low level of 
emotional reactivity (or vice versa). As regards the link between social adjustment and emotional reactivity, this 
means that the more the child was perceived as being socially well adjusted, the more he/she was perceived as 
having low emotional reactivity (or vice versa). 

It  might  be  interesting  to  test  these  training  sessions  with  atypical  children  (e.g.,  children  with  or  at  risk  of 
developing externalizing problems) in order to vary the score for social (mal)adjustment. Furthermore, it could 
be relevant to test this kind of training via medium-term training (for instance, 15 sessions over 2 months). 

7. Implications for Research and Intervention 

In summary, this battery of pretests and post-tests does differentiate between socio-cognitive profiles and could 
be useful for detecting weaknesses in pre-schoolers in order to better understand social (mal) adjustment, as this 
is a critical developmental period just before the start of primary  school,  where the child  will create  his or her 
social network of peers. Results showed positive quantitative and qualitative effects of both types of short-term 
training  and  confirmed  that  the  two  training  procedures  are  efficient.  Future  studies  should  determine  whether 
these improvements are observed in atypical populations. For instance, these procedures could help EB children 
to increase their socio-cognitive skills and, consequently, to decrease their EB and their social maladjustment. 

Early  detection  of  socio-cognitive  difficulties  could  allow  intervention  before  the  emergence  of  lasting 
difficulties  in  childhood  and  help  to  limit  the  child‘s  disabilities  (primary  prevention).  As  Denham,  Bassett, 
Mincic,  Kalb,  Way,  Wyatt,  and  Segal  (2012)  have  shown,  children  who  have  lower  sad-prosocial  and  higher 
angry-aggressive  choices  to  hypothetical  peer  provocation  also  have  weaker  skills  in  social  problem-solving 
(children in the ―social-emotional learning risk group‖). According to these authors, pre-schoolers‘ programming 
should  take  social-emotional  learning  into  account,  because  the  ―social-emotional  learning  risk  group‖  is 
characterized by difficulty in understanding and identifying emotions and an angry-aggressive pattern of social 
problem-solving. Training for at-risk pre-schoolers is critical, as it lays the foundations for later development and 
behavior concerning their social environment (Webster-Stratton et al., 2011). 

This study could help teachers and parents by providing a basis for early training plans, as these types of training 
can ensure better social adjustment and integration.
