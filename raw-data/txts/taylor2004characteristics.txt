The Characteristics and Correlates of Fantasy in School-Age Children:

Imaginary Companions, Impersonation, and Social Understanding

Past research with 152 preschoolers found that having an imaginary companion or impersonating an
imaginary character was positively correlated with theory of mind performance. Three years later, 100
children from this study were retested to assess the developmental course of play with imaginary
companions and impersonation of imaginary characters and how these types of role play were related to
emotion understanding, self-perception, and personality. The results showed that school-age children
interact with imaginary companions and impersonate imaginary characters as much as preschoolers.
Overall, 65% of children up to the age of 7 had imaginary companions at some point during their lives.
School-age children who did not impersonate scored lower on emotion understanding. Theory of mind
at age 4 predicted emotion understanding 3 years later.

Despite a recent surge of interest in describing the phenomenon
of imaginary companions (Ball, Lalonde, & Wright-Cassidy, 1999;
Gleason, 2002; Gleason, Sebanc, & Hartup, 2000; D. G. Singer &
Singer, 1990; Taylor, 1999; Taylor & Carlson, 1997), there are still
many unanswered questions about it. In particular, the develop-
mental course of this type of pretend play is not well understood.
Some researchers have claimed that the incidence of imaginary
companions peaks in preschool (Fraiberg, 1959; Manosevitz, Pren-
tice, & Wilson, 1973; Piaget, 1962) along with other types of
pretense, making the preschool period the “high season of imag-
inative play” (D. G. Singer & Singer, 1990, p. 64). However, in
one recent study, 28% of children 5 to 12 years of age had
imaginary companions (Pearson et al., 2001). Other research sug-
gests that even adolescents sometimes have imaginary companions
(Hurlock & Burnstein, 1932; Seiffge-Krenke, 1993, 1997). In
addition, research by Cohen and MacKeith (1991) indicates that
some older children and adolescents create imaginary worlds for
their pretend friends and other imagined creatures to inhabit.

Very little is known about the imaginary companions that are
created by older children or about
the fate of the imaginary
companions that emerge during the preschool period. It is possible
that interactions with imaginary companions diminish as children
enter school but then reemerge in a different form during adoles-

cence. This hypothesis is consistent with research by Newson and
Newson (1976), who found that most children no longer had
imaginary companions by the time they were 6 or 7 years old.
However, this research was based on parental report, which even
for preschoolers can be inaccurate or incomplete (Taylor & Carl-
son, 1997). Given the tendency of older children to act out fantasy
less overtly than younger children, parents might underestimate the
ages at which imaginary companions are abandoned or be unaware
of newly created ones. Pearson et al. (2001) interviewed the
children themselves and found evidence that older children had
imaginary companions, but there was no information in that study
about whether the imaginary companions were new or were the
continuations of imaginary companions created in early childhood.
The major goal of this study was to learn more about the
developmental course of play with imaginary companions. The
participants were 6- and 7-year-olds (N ⫽ 100) who had been
interviewed about pretend play and fantasy 3 years earlier when
they were 3 and 4 years old. Thirty-one of these children had
described imaginary companions in the original study (Taylor &
Carlson, 1997). Our goal was to discover (a) what had happened to
those imaginary companions and (b) the extent to which new ones
had been created. As in past research (Gleason et al., 2000; Taylor
& Carlson, 1997), the category of imaginary companions included
personified objects (i.e., special toys or other objects that children
endow with a personality and interact with on a regular basis) as
well as invisible friends. The research findings are mixed with
respect to the prevalence of imaginary companions in older chil-
dren, but we suspected that this type of play would be less common
in the school-age sample and that the imaginary companions
described 3 years earlier would be gone.

In addition to questions about imaginary companions, we asked
the children and parents about imaginary characters that the chil-
dren impersonated (i.e., characters that were acted out rather than

1174

treated as separate individuals). This type of role play is concep-
tually related to having an imaginary companion because it in-
volves imagining the characteristics and perspective of another
individual (Harris, 2000). In past research, Taylor and Carlson
(1997) found that the cognitive correlates of having an imaginary
companion were also related to impersonating an imaginary char-
acter. However, there are differences in these types of role play as
well as similarities. In particular, Carlson and Taylor (in press)
found an interesting sex difference: Preschool girls were more
likely than boys to have an imaginary companion, whereas boys
were more likely than girls to impersonate an imaginary character.
By asking about both imaginary companions and impersonated
characters, we were able to explore further developmental change
and sex differences in these types of role play. We predicted that
impersonated characters as well as imaginary companions would
be less common in our school-age sample because, in general,
pretend play is widely believed to decline after age 5 (for a review,
see F. P. Hughes, 1999) and, in particular, imaginary companions
have been strongly associated with the preschool period (Mano-
sevitz et al., 1973; Newson & Newson, 1976).

Another purpose of the study was to learn more about the
correlates of having an imaginary companion and/or impersonat-
ing an imaginary character. In the original study with preschoolers,
Taylor and Carlson (1997) examined the relation between these
types of role play and performance on theory of mind tasks.
Theory of mind was assessed with a composite score that com-
bined measures of false belief, appearance–reality, representa-
tional change, and perspective taking (Flavell, Flavell, & Green,
1983; Gopnik & Astington, 1988; Perner, Leekam, & Wimmer,
1987; Taylor, 1988). Taylor and Carlson’s hypothesis was that
engaging in role play develops children’s understanding that men-
tal representations do not always constitute an accurate reflection
of the external world. This insight is crucial for theory of mind
tasks, and thus they predicted a positive correlation between role
play and theory of mind. For 4-year-olds, they found the predicted
relation between role play and theory of mind (independent of
differences in sex and verbal intelligence). For 3-year-olds, this
relation was not significant, possibly because of a floor effect in
theory of mind performance (e.g., the mean false belief score was
0.5 out of 3).

In this study, we wanted to determine whether having an imag-
inary companion and/or impersonating an imagined character at
ages 3 and 4 were related to theory of mind performance at age 7;
however, most theory of mind tasks (e.g., false belief, appearance–
reality) are used to assess development between 3 and 5 years of
age and are not appropriate for school-age children. Even the
second-order false belief task, which is sometimes used as a
measure of later-developing theory of mind skills, is typically
mastered by age 6 (Baron-Cohen, 2000). To elicit individual
differences in performance at age 7, we used a task developed by
Gnepp and her colleagues (Gnepp & Chilamkurti, 1988; Gnepp &
Gould, 1985) to assess children’s understanding of personality
traits as internal mediators of emotional responses. Although this
task involves questions about emotions and traits rather than
beliefs and desires, it is considered to tap theory of mind under-
standing. For example, in their review of the theory of mind
literature, Wellman and Lagattuta (2000) listed awareness of per-
sonality traits, as assessed in Gnepp’s task, as an important insight
about mind and behavior that develops after age 6. The preschool

child understands that people have desires, beliefs, and prefer-
ences; the school-age child understands that “these mental at-
tributes can be person-specific, enduring, and consistent across
situations in the form of personality traits” (p. 29). In addition,
Yuill (1992; Yuill & Pearson, 1998) has identified children’s
understanding of the causal role of traits in generating desires and
beliefs as an important milestone in theory of mind development.
More specifically, Yuill and Pearson have conceptually linked
Gnepp’s task with theory of mind development beyond the pre-
school years.

There is some evidence for a close association between false
belief performance and concurrent emotion understanding during
the preschool years (e.g., C. Hughes & Dunn, 1998); however, no
previous research has investigated whether performance on stan-
dard theory of mind tasks predicts the later-developing ability to
make inferences about the emotional reactions of individuals on
the basis of personality traits. Thus, our first prediction was that we
would find evidence for this relation: We expected that children’s
performance on theory of mind tasks at age 4 would be correlated
with performance on the Gnepp (Gnepp & Chilamkurti, 1988;
Gnepp & Gould, 1985) emotion prediction task. Second, we pre-
dicted that individual variation on this task would be related to
children’s history of role play in preschool and possibly to their
current fantasy behavior. Such a result would extend previous
work showing that emotion perspective taking in preschool chil-
dren is related to the amount and complexity of their pretend play
(Connolly & Doyle, 1984; Youngblade & Dunn, 1995).

In addition to theory of mind and emotion perspective taking,
we were interested in learning about other correlates of role play.
First of all, do children who have a history of imaginary compan-
ions and/or impersonated characters differ from their peers in other
fantasy behaviors at age 7? To determine whether role play was
related to children’s fantasy behavior at age 7, we gave children
the Children’s Fantasy Inventory (CFI). To our knowledge, the
CFI is the most comprehensive questionnaire designed to collect
self-report information about the fantasy lives of school-age chil-
dren (Rosenfeld, Huesmann, Eron, & Torney-Purta, 1982). Our
hypothesis was that individual differences in preschool role play
would reflect an interest in fantasy that has some stability over
time and thus would be related to variation in children’s responses
on this questionnaire.

Most past research investigating the differences between chil-
dren with and without imaginary companions has focused on
personality characteristics or socioemotional well-being. Research
that has used typically developing populations has presented a
mostly positive picture of children with imaginary companions
(for a review, see Taylor, 1999). For example, in comparison with
children who do not have imaginary companions, children who
create imaginary companions are more sociable and less shy
(Mauro, 1991), are more creative (Schaefer, 1969), participate in
more family activities (Manosevitz et al., 1973), and show more
positive affect in their play with other children (D. G. Singer &
Singer, 1990). In addition, Seiffge-Krenke (1993, 1997) found that
socially competent and creative adolescents with good coping
skills were particularly likely to refer to imaginary companions in
their diaries. However,
there has been a
tendency to associate imaginary companions with loneliness,
trauma, and/or emotional distress (Benson & Pryor, 1973; Nagera,
1969). Recently, it has been noted that both imaginary companions

IMAGINARY COMPANIONS

and impersonated characters (referred to as “elaborated play iden-
tities”) are common in children with dissociative disorders, and
care must be taken to distinguish the normal phenomena from the
pathological (Putnam, 1997; Silberg, 1998). There are also some
normative studies that have yielded negative or mixed findings
concerning the extent to which imaginary companions are associ-
ated with positive characteristics (Harter & Chao, 1992; Pearson et
al., 2001).

Our goal in this study was to conduct a broad investigation of
the personality and temperament characteristics that might be
associated with role-play behavior. We collected information
about the children’s personalities from their parents, who were
given the California Child Q-Set (CCQS). According to Caspi et
al. (1992), this instrument captures and reflects “the wide variation
in children’s personalities, their characteristic ways of approaching
and responding to the social world, their distinctive styles of
coping with uncertainty and ambiguity, their strengths and weak-
nesses, resources and vulnerabilities, and competencies and inad-
equacies” (p. 512). We used the CCQS to assess the five factor
model as applied to child personality (John, Caspi, Robins, Mof-
fitt, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1994) and also two constructs related to
temperament: ego resilience, defined as the tendency to respond
flexibly rather than rigidly to changing situational demands, par-
ticularly stressful situations, and ego control, defined as the ten-
dency to contain versus express emotional and motivational im-
pulses (Block & Block, 1980). We were particularly interested in
ego control because of its conceptual relation to inhibitory control,
which is associated with individual differences in both theory of
mind and fantasy (Carlson & Moses, 2001; Carlson, Gum, Davis
& Molloy, 2003). This part of the study was largely exploratory,
but we predicted that role play would be associated with positive
rather than negative characteristics (e.g., ego control).

In addition to the parent-report measure of personality, we
collected information from the children about their perceptions of
their own competence. For this purpose we used the Pictorial Scale
of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance (PSPCSA), a
standardized procedure for measuring children’s sense of compe-
tence in four domains (cognitive competence, physical compe-
tence, peer acceptance, and maternal acceptance; Harter & Pike,
1984). In past research with this measure, higher self-ratings of
peer acceptance were correlated with high levels of fantasy in the
social free play of children ages 4 to 8 (Flannery & Watson, 1993).
This finding is consistent with research by J. L. Singer and Singer
(1981) showing that high-fantasy children were particularly likely
to get along well with others. However, Harter and Chao (1992)
did not find significant differences in perceived competence for
preschool children with and without imaginary companions. Given
the older age of the children in our sample and our more inclusive
categorization of play, we predicted that children who engaged in
role play would score higher on the PSPCSA.

In summary, our goals in this research were to provide new
information about the developmental course of having imaginary
companions and engaging in impersonation, to determine whether
the differences in social understanding related to role play found in
preschool children would still be present at age 7, and to explore
other possible correlates in middle childhood of having an imag-
inary companion and/or impersonating an imagined character.

Method

Participants

The children in this study all participated in research (Taylor & Carlson,
1997) on imaginary companions conducted when they were preschoolers
(mean age ⫽ 4 years 0 months; range ⫽ 3 years 4 months to 4 years 8
months). We attempted to make contact with all 152 families who partic-
ipated in that study by sending them a letter describing the present study,
followed by a phone call asking if they were interested in participating in
this research. Eight families had moved out of state, 15 parents chose not
to participate, and 29 parents could not be contacted. The final sample
consisted of 100 children, 50 girls and 50 boys. The amount of time
between the original (Time 1) and follow-up (Time 2) sessions ranged from
19 to 46 months (M ⫽ 32.3, SD ⫽ 6.25; Mdn ⫽ 34). There were outliers
in this distribution because some families contacted us immediately upon
hearing about the follow-up research, whereas others were very difficult to
locate. The children ranged in age from 5 years 4 months to 8 years 3
months (mean age ⫽ 6 years 9 months, SD ⫽ 9.14 months) and included
31 children who had imaginary companions at Time 1. The returning group
of children was higher in verbal ability (as assessed at Time 1 using the
Peabody Picture Vocabulary Task—Revised [PPVT–R]) than the group of
children who did not return: returning, M ⫽ 108.44, SD ⫽ 12.41; nonre-
turning, M ⫽ 103.77, SD ⫽ 12.35; t(149) ⫽ 2.20, p ⬍ .05. However, the
returning group of children did not differ from the nonreturning children on
any of the other measures taken at Time 1 (imaginary companions, imper-
sonation, theory of mind).

Procedure

In the previous study conducted 3 years earlier, Taylor and Carlson
(1997) collected information from the children to assess their verbal ability
(PPVT–R), theory of mind (a series of 13 standard tasks assessing false
belief, representational change, appearance–reality, and perspective tak-
ing), and fantasy behavior (in particular, play with imaginary companions).
The parents also provided information about the children’s fantasy behav-
ior. In the present study, children were asked to provide information about
imaginary companions (current and past). Then they were given the
PSPCSA (Harter & Pike, 1984), a series of six emotion prediction and
explanation tasks (Gnepp & Chilamkurti, 1988), and the CFI (Rosenfeld et
al., 1982). It was not possible to include a language assessment at Time 2
because of the length of the session; however, scores on the PPVT–R have
been found to be relatively stable over time (Bracken & Murray, 1984;
Scruggs, Mastropieri, & Argulewicz, 1983). In a separate room, the parents
were asked about their children’s imaginary companions and were given
the CCQS (Caspi et al., 1992). The sessions were videotaped and lasted
approximately 1 hr. Each of the measures is described in turn below.

Child Tasks

Imaginary companion questionnaire.

In the previous research when
the children were preschoolers, the children and parents were interviewed
twice, and their reports were compared. Information from all four inter-
views (two with the child and two with the parent) was used to assess the
child’s imaginary companion status. We believe this labor-intensive pro-
cedure is optimal with preschoolers because they sometimes make up an
imaginary companion on the spot when asked if they have one, they
sometimes have their own language for referring to imaginary companions
(e.g., “ghost sister”) and do not understand our term pretend friend, and
they sometimes describe a real friend when asked about a pretend one.
Also, sometimes parents describe a pretend friend when the child says he
or she does not have one. In these cases, it is helpful to later ask the child
directly about the pretend friend using the name given by the parent (e.g.,
“Who is Baintor?”). By interviewing the children and their parents on two
separate occasions, Taylor and Carlson (1997) were able to cross-check

their answers at Visit 1 with those at Visit 2 (scheduled about 1 week later)
and to disambiguate inconsistencies by asking follow-up questions. Note
that although parent report can help sort out misunderstandings, parent
report by itself is often not an adequate source of information about
children’s imaginary companions because parents often do not know much
about their children’s imaginary companions, especially those of older
children (Newson & Newson, 1976). For example, a mother in past
research told Taylor (1999) that her son played with an invisible child
named Nobby, but the son reported that he talked with (did not play with)
an invisible 160-year-old businessman named Nobby.

In the present school-age assessment, we reasoned that the children
themselves would be better able to understand the interview questions and
would more reliably report whether they currently had an imaginary
companion than when they were 3 or 4 years old. Thus it did not seem
necessary to interview the parents and children on two separate occasions.
However, we retained Taylor and Carlson’s (1997) method of interviewing
both parents and children. At the end of the procedure, the responses for
parents and children were compared and, if necessary, the parent was asked
additional questions for clarification while the child played with toys. For
example, if the child described a stuffed animal as a pretend friend, the
parent was asked more specifically about the child’s interactions with the
stuffed animal.

As in the previous research, we asked about imaginary companions in

the following way:

First I am going to ask you some questions about friends. Some
friends are real like the kids who live on your street, the ones you play
with. And some friends are pretend friends. Pretend friends are ones
that are make-believe, that you pretend are real. Do you have a
pretend friend?

When children said no, they were asked if they had ever had a pretend
friend. If they again said no but had reported having a pretend friend 3
years earlier, we asked if they remembered the past pretend friend (e.g.,
“Do you remember Baintor?”). If the child reported that he or she currently
had or previously had a pretend friend, we asked a series of questions about
the characteristics of the friend (e.g., age, gender) and their interaction with
it (e.g., “What did you like most about Baintor?”). For past pretend friends,
children also were asked when and why they stopped playing with the
friend. Then we asked children about impersonation (if they ever pretended
to be a person or an animal). (See the Appendix for the complete list of
questions.)

Pictorial Scale of Perceived Competence and Social Acceptance. The
PSPCSA is a standardized procedure for assessing children’s sense of
competence in four domains: cognitive competence, physical competence,
peer acceptance, and maternal acceptance (Harter & Pike, 1984). Children
were shown pictures of two children who were described in contrasting
ways (e.g., “This girl is good at spelling; this girl is not good at spelling.”).
Then children were asked which child was most like them. After they made
their choice, they were asked if that child was “a little” or “a lot” like
themselves. This procedure provides a 4-point scale indexing children’s
self-judgments for 24 characteristics, six in each of the four content
domains.

Emotion prediction and explanation task. This task was developed by
Gnepp and Chilamkurti (1988) to assess the extent to which children
predict and explain another person’s emotional reactions in terms of
personality traits. Fortunately, we were able to obtain the original drawings
used in this task and thus were able to exactly replicate Gnepp and
Chilamkurti’s procedure. The protagonists were depicted in a gender-
neutral way, and each was given a name that matched the participant’s own
gender (e.g., Jerry for a male participant, Jenny for a female participant).
In each of these tasks, three drawings were designed to provide evidence
that the protagonist had a particular personality trait (i.e., selfish, helpful,
mean, clown, honest, and shy). For the fourth picture in each task, the
character was depicted in a potentially emotion-evoking situation, and the

child was asked if the character felt happy or sad and why he or she felt that
way. In each case, the situation depicted in the fourth picture would be
expected to elicit one type of response from most people but the opposite
type of response from someone who had the protagonist’s personality trait.
For example, for the clown task, the participant was shown pictures in
which the character was (a) wearing a pair of toy antennae in front of three
other children (“This is a story about a boy named Jerry. Jerry always
makes his friends laugh.”), (b) making funny faces for his classmates
(“During recess, he makes silly noises and weird faces.”), and (c) imitating
the teacher in front of the other children when her back was turned (“When
his teacher is not looking, Jerry copies her and everybody laughs.”). In the
fourth picture, (d) all the other children were laughing and pointing at
Jerry’s feet (“One day, Jerry walked into class and took off his boots. When
the class saw that he was wearing one black shoe and one white shoe, they
all started laughing.”) The test questions were “Do you think Jerry felt
happy or sad when they laughed?” and “Why did he feel that way?” Most
children might feel sad in this situation because they were being laughed at,
but Jerry had been described as a class clown who liked to make people
laugh, so he would be expected to feel happy. Descriptions of the pictures
for each of the six personality characteristics are provided in Table 1.

Children’s Fantasy Inventory. The CFI is a 45-item questionnaire
developed by Rosenfeld et al. (1982) to assess the daydreaming and
imaginative play of elementary school children (first to third grade). There
are nine scales on this measure: Frequency (e.g., “Counting all the different
kinds of pretend games—when you are alone how much do you play
pretend games?”), Aggressive (e.g., “Do you sometimes have daydreams
about hitting or hurting somebody that you don’t like?”), Fanciful (e.g.,
“Do you like to play pretend games about how things were when you were
much younger, before you started going to school?”), Absorption (e.g., “Do
you keep right on playing or reading, even when it is noisy in the room?”),
Scary (e.g., “Are your daydreams sometimes so scary that you try really
hard not to think about them anymore?”), Vividness (e.g., “When you play
pretend games, do you feel like you can really see the pretend people and
places in the room with you?”), Intellectual (e.g., “Have you ever won-
dered about things like how a bird can fly or how a fish can live in
water?”), Active-Heroic (e.g., “When you are daydreaming do you think
about being the winner in a game that you like to play?”), and Dysphoric
(e.g., “Do you sometimes dream about someone in your family getting
hurt?”). For all scales except Frequency, children responded to each
question by saying “no”, “a little,” or “a lot” (scores ⫽ 0, 1, and 2,
respectively). For the Frequency items, children responded by saying
“never,” “many times a day/night,” or “every day/night.”

Parent Tasks

Imaginary companion questionnaire. Parents were asked a series of
questions about their children’s imaginary companions. Imaginary com-
panions were described in the following way:

An imaginary companion is a very vivid imaginary character (person,
animal) with which a child interacts during his or her play and daily
activities. Sometimes the companion is entirely invisible; sometimes
the companion takes the form of a stuffed animal or doll. An example
of an imaginary companion based on a stuffed animal is Hobbes in the
popular comic strip “Calvin and Hobbes.”

Parents were asked if their child currently had or ever had an imaginary
companion. If the parent said yes to either (or both) questions, we asked a
series of questions about the characteristics of the imaginary companion
and the child’s interactions with it. Parents were also asked about their
child’s impersonation (e.g., “Has your child ever pretended to be an
animal? If yes, please describe the animal that your child pretended to be.
How often did your child pretend to be this animal? At what age and for
what period of time?”).

is an instrument developed for the assessment of children’s personalities on

the basis of reports of nonprofessional observers such as parents. The
CCQS consists of 100 statements describing a wide range of personality,
cognitive, and social attributes (e.g., “He gets along well with others”; “He
is bossy and likes to dominate other people.”). The parent’s task is to sort
the items into nine categories ranging from “extremely uncharacteristic”
(Category 1) of their child to “extremely characteristic” of their child
(Category 9), with items that are neither characteristic nor uncharacteristic
going into the middle category (Category 5). The parent began the task by
reading the 100 items and dividing them into two piles, one for items that
were descriptive of their child and the other for items that were not
descriptive of their child. Then parents read the items from the descriptive
pile to select the 11 items that were most characteristic of their child and
put them in Category 9. The next 11 went into Category 8, and so on.
(Category 5—neither characteristic nor uncharacteristic—was the only
category to have 10 items.) This procedure was then repeated for the other
pile, with the parent beginning by selecting the 11 items that were most
uncharacteristic of their child.

Results

We first report the results for each of the school-age (Time 2)
assessments (fantasy, emotion understanding, self-perception, and
personality) and, for fantasy and emotion understanding, how
these results relate to the corresponding assessments conducted 3
years earlier (Time 1). Then we discuss the relations between
fantasy, emotion understanding, self-perception, and personality.
Note that
there were no corresponding assessments for self-
perception and personality in the Time 1 preschool assessment.
Also there was no corresponding test of verbal ability at Time 2.

Assessment of Fantasy

School-Age Assessment

The school-age fantasy assessment consisted of (a) imaginary
companion scores, (b) impersonation scores, and (c) composite
and subscale scores from the CFI.

Imaginary companion scores. The imaginary companion
score was based primarily on the reports of the children them-
selves. The parent reports were used as supporting information that
helped to disambiguate information collected from the children. In

particular, parent report was helpful in determining whether a toy
mentioned by the child should be categorized as an imaginary
companion. Two coders assigned a score of 0 if (a) the child said
that he or she did not have an imaginary companion, (b) the child
said that he or she had an imaginary companion but did not provide
any information about it (e.g., no name, no description), or (c) the
child said that he or she had an imaginary companion that was
based on a toy, but the description did not go beyond describing
the physical characteristics of the toy and the parent report did not
indicate that the child treated the toy as an imaginary companion.
The coders assigned a score of 1 if the child said that he or she had
an imaginary companion and provided a description of it. In the
case of stuffed animals or dolls, the description (in either the
child’s or the parent’s report) had to go beyond the physical
appearance to include psychological details (e.g., “She is nice to
me”). The agreement for the two coders was 91%; the disagree-
ments were resolved by discussion.

Forty-nine of 100 children (24 boys and 25 girls) received a
score of 1, indicating that they were categorized as providing
descriptions of imaginary companions (31 descriptions of current
imaginary companions and 18 descriptions of past imaginary com-
panions). Fifty-one (26 boys and 25 girls) received a score of 0,
indicating that they did not provide descriptions of imaginary
companions. The imaginary companion scores were not related to
age, sex, or Time 1 verbal ability. Even at age 6 –7 years, a
substantial number of children were currently playing with imag-
inary companions. The percentage (31%) is similar to what Taylor
and Carlson (1997) found at Time 1 when the children were 3– 4
years old (28% of the 152 preschool children were categorized as
playing with imaginary companions). Thus, having an imaginary
companion is at least as common among 6- and 7-year-olds as it is
among 3- and 4-year-olds. It is interesting that the sex difference
at Time 1 (more girls than boys had imaginary companions) was
not found at Time 2. Boys and girls were equally likely at Time 2
to describe an imaginary companion. If we look only at the
children who were currently playing with imaginary companions
at Time 2 (n ⫽ 31), this group included 15 boys and 16 girls.

TAYLOR, CARLSON, MARING, GEROW, AND CHARLEY

As in past research (Taylor & Carlson, 1997), child and parent
reports were sometimes conflicting. Altogether, 64 parent– child
pairs gave consistent reports: 43 parent– child pairs agreed that the
child did not have an imaginary companion, and 21 pairs agreed
the child did have an imaginary companion. Thirty-four parent–
child pairs gave inconsistent reports: 27 children claimed to have
an imaginary companion but their parents said they did not, and 7
children said they did not have an imaginary companion but their
parents said they did. (Note that parent– child consistency is re-
ported for 98 participants because 2 parents did not complete the
imaginary companion questionnaire.)

Descriptions of the 49 primary imaginary companions (the one
described first and most fully by each participant) were coded for
gender, age, whether they were based on a toy or completely
invisible, whether they were human or animal, and whether they
were everyday or exotic entities. Of the 49 imaginary companions,
33 (67%) were invisible (see Table 2 for examples), 13 (27%) were
toys (stuffed animals or dolls), 2 (4%) were both toys and invisible
(e.g., one child played with an imaginary companion named Ser-
geant Savage that was based on a GI Joe doll but could also be
invisible if the child did not happen to have the doll at hand), and
1 was based on the child’s reflection in a mirror. Past research has
also found that a few children have both invisible and toy versions
of their imaginary companions (Taylor, 1999; also see Gleason et
al., 2000).

Twenty-eight (57%) of the imaginary companions were humans,
and 20 (41%) were animals. One additional imaginary companion

was a human who could transform herself into any animal the child
wanted. We also coded whether the imaginary companion was an
everyday person or animal (e.g., a little boy with blond hair and
blue eyes) or had exotic characteristics (e.g., magical abilities such
as being able to fly, unusual physical descriptions such as having
blue skin, or other exotic features such as having a pet crocodile).
(The exotic feature could be provided by either the child or the
parent.) Thirty-two (65%) of the imaginary companions were
coded as everyday types of animals or people, whereas 16 (33%)
were coded as exotic. (One of the descriptions was not detailed
enough to make this determination.) In Table 2, Rose, Zippy, Fake
Rachel, Michael, and Shannon are examples of everyday imagi-
nary companions. Simpy, Skateboard Guy, The Good Indian,
Alicia, Robert, and Elephant were coded as exotic.

The gender of 5 imaginary companions (10%) was unknown, 2
(4%) were specified as having no gender, 24 (49%) were male, and
18 (37%) were female. Of the 42 imaginary companions with a
specified gender, 37 were the same gender as the child who
described them (19 male–male pairs and 18 female–female pairs).
Five girls had male imaginary companions, but none of the boys
had a female imaginary companion. The imaginary companions
ranged in age from 2 months to 100 years, with the majority being
within 3 years of the child’s age. Ten imaginary companions
(20%) were described as being the same age as the child, 16 (33%)
were older, 15 (31%) were younger, and 8 (16%) had ages that
were not known.

Impersonation scores. At Time 1, we found that almost all the
children reported that they sometimes pretended to be an animal or
a person. Although we expected impersonation to be less common
in these older children, 95 of the 100 children stated that they
played impersonation games, and their parents tended to corrobo-
rate the information provided by the children. However, 5 children
(3 boys and 2 girls) said they did not impersonate (but their parents
said that they did), and 8 parents said their children (2 boys and 6
girls) did not impersonate (but the children said that they did). In
order to capture as much as possible the small amount of variabil-
ity in responses to questions about impersonation, we assigned a
score of 1 when both parent and child said yes to playing imper-
sonation games (n ⫽ 82) and 0 when only one source said yes (n ⫽
13). (There were no cases in which both the child and the parent
said no regarding impersonation.) Five parents did not answer the
impersonation questions, and thus the sample size for this analysis
was 95. Impersonation scores were unrelated to children’s imagi-
nary companion status, ␹2(1, N ⫽ 95) ⫽ 0.12, ns.

CFI scores. Average ratings on the CFI scales are shown in
Table 3. Children’s scores on the nine CFI scales were internally
consistent (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .88, average item–total correlation ⫽
.65). Therefore, we computed a composite CFI score for each child
for use in further analyses. The composite CFI scores were posi-
tively correlated with age, r(100) ⫽ .22, p ⬍ .05, but were
unrelated to sex or Time 1 verbal ability. There were no sex
differences on the individual CFI subscales with one exception:
Boys scored significantly higher on the Active-Heroic scale (M ⫽
.90, SD ⫽ .43) than did girls (M ⫽ .68, SD ⫽ .47), t(98) ⫽ 2.45,
p ⬍ .05.

There was no significant difference in composite CFI scores
between children who had an imaginary companion and those who
did not, t(98) ⫽ ⫺1.62, ns. Children with an imaginary companion
had significantly higher scores on the Fanciful subscale than did
children without an imaginary companion, t(98) ⫽ ⫺2.76, p ⬍
.01; however, this difference is partly due to method overlap
because one of the items on the Fanciful subscale inquires about
pretend friends. Children’s CFI composite scores did not differ
according to whether children engaged in impersonation, t(93) ⫽
⫺0.88, ns. Impersonation also was not related to any of the CFI
subscale scores. For reasons we do not fully understand, the CFI
not only failed to correlate with measures of fantasy, it also did not
correlate with any of the other major measures in this study (e.g.,
emotion understanding, self-perception, and personality). Perhaps
the response format (i.e., answering “no,” “a little,” or “a lot” to a

sample, who were on the young end of the population appropriate
for this measure. Given the lack of correlations, the results with the
CFI are not discussed further.

Longitudinal Assessment of Fantasy

Of the children in this study, 31 had described imaginary com-
panions at Time 1, and 69 had not described imaginary compan-
ions at Time 1. Table 4 shows the imaginary companion status for
these children (N ⫽ 100) at Time 1 and Time 2. Although many of
the children who played with imaginary companions in preschool
continued this fantasy activity into elementary school, the specific
imaginary companions described at the time of the preschool
assessment were not necessarily the same ones described 3 years
later. Of the 31 children who had an imaginary companion at Time
1, only 3 were still playing with the same imaginary companion at
Time 2 (2 of these long-lived imaginary companions were invis-
ible, and 1 was a stuffed bear). In fact, only 12 of those 31 children
(39%) even remembered the imaginary companions they had de-
scribed 3 years earlier. This result is consistent with the finding of
a smaller-scale longitudinal study in which many children did not
recall imaginary companions they had described 7 months earlier
(Taylor, Cartwright, & Carlson, 1993). The children’s imaginary
companion status at Time 1 did not predict their imaginary com-
panion status at Time 2. Thus, there was less stability in this type
of role play than predicted. Overall, the results indicated that
children create imaginary companions throughout the preschool
years and beyond.

To calculate the overall prevalence of imaginary companions in
this population (N ⫽ 100), we combined the 49 children who
described an imaginary companion (either past or present) at Time
2 with the 16 children who had described an imaginary companion
at Time 1 but not at Time 2. Thus, according to the criteria used in
this research, the percentage of children up to the age of 7 who had
imaginary companions at some point during their lives was 65%.
The imaginary companions described as current by the children
in this study included 20 invisible companions (67%) and 10
companions based on toys (33%); 1 imaginary companion was
sometimes invisible and sometimes based on a toy. At Time 1,
when the children were preschoolers, the 42 imaginary compan-
ions included 20 that were invisible (48%) and 22 that were based
on toys (52%). Thus, the imaginary companions played with by
older children were more likely to be invisible than were their
preschool counterparts. At both ages, the imaginary companions
were remarkably varied in their characteristics, including ordinary
girls and boys along with a variety of interesting and unusual
individuals. At Time 2, we collected our first examples of an
invisible snowman, an invisible elephant, an invisible squirrel, and
an imaginary companion with a pierced ear.

One of the goals of this study was to investigate the reasons why
children stop playing with their imaginary companions. Of the 31
children in this study who had described an imaginary companion
at Time 1, 28 had stopped playing with it at Time 2. In addition,
13 children who did not have an imaginary companion at Time 1
described imaginary companions that had been created after Time
1 but abandoned before Time 2 (1 of these children also had a
current imaginary companion). Thus, altogether, 41 children and
their parents were asked about the fate of past imaginary compan-

ions. Of the 41 parents, 1 parent said that the imaginary companion
was given up when the family moved to a new house, and 1 parent
reported that the child gave up the imaginary companion when he
was feeling more settled in a new home and had more real friends.
The other 39 parents were not able to provide any information
about the disappearance of the imaginary companions. Eight of the
41 children provided explanations: 3 children said that the imag-
inary companion went away (e.g., “She ran away and didn’t come
back”), 1 child said that he outgrew the imaginary companion, 1
child said the imaginary companion outgrew her (i.e., “He re-
tired”), 1 child said he found more real friends, 1 child said he did
not get into trouble anymore and so did not talk to the imaginary
companion any more, 1 child said she stopped playing with an
imaginary puppy when she got a real dog, and 1 child said that it
got boring. The other 33 children either did not remember the
imaginary companion or did not remember why they stopped
playing with it.

We had predicted some degree of stability in children’s fantasy
behaviors over the 3-year period, but this prediction was not
supported. Having an imaginary companion at Time 1 was not
related to having one at Time 2. There were also no significant
predictions from the other measures of fantasy at Time 1 (imper-
sonation, pretend actions) to any of our Time 2 fantasy measures.
However, it was interesting that the incidence of imaginary com-
panions and impersonation in the sample as a whole continued to
be substantial—and much higher than predicted—into the school-
age years.

Assessment of Emotion Understanding and Theory of

Mind

School-Age Assessment of Emotion Understanding

The assessment of emotion understanding was based on chil-
dren’s performance on Gnepp and Chilamkurti’s (1988) task in
which children learned about the behaviors of six different char-
acters and were required to predict and explain the emotional
reaction of each character in a new situation. Following Gnepp and
Chilamkurti, we computed the mean proportion of trait-consistent
predictions and trait-relevant explanations for each participant.
Mean scores on the emotion prediction and justification items for
each trait are shown in Table 5. The prediction and justification
scores (across items) were significantly correlated, r(98) ⫽ .85,
p ⬍ .001. Therefore, we averaged these scores, creating an emo-
tion understanding composite score for each child. Emotion un-

derstanding was not related to age at Time 2 or to sex, but there
was a trend suggesting a relation with verbal ability, r(97) ⫽ .18,
p ⬍ .10.

Longitudinal Assessment of Social Understanding

As discussed earlier, we consider the theory of mind assessment
conducted at Time 1 to be conceptually related to the Time 2
assessment of emotion understanding because both require an
understanding of behavior that takes personal characteristics (e.g.,
an individual’s beliefs, desires, or preferences) into account. Over-
all, there was a trend in the data suggesting a relation between
composite theory of mind scores at Time 1 and children’s emotion
understanding composite scores at Time 2, r(98) ⫽ .19, p ⬍ .10.
However, the relation between theory of mind and emotion under-
standing was more clearly revealed when we examined the relation
separately for the two age subsets of children at Time 1 (children
who were 3 years old and children who were 4 years old). Separate
analyses were helpful because there was a floor effect among the
3-year-olds on the theory of mind measures at Time 1. Given this
measurement problem, it is not surprising that in this subset of
children, there was not a significant relation between theory of
mind and emotion understanding, r(33) ⫽ ⫺.20. However, a
separate analysis of the subset of children who were age 4 at Time
1 revealed a significant relation between early theory of mind and
later emotion understanding, r(65) ⫽ .31, p ⫽ .01. This relation
remained significant after we controlled for Time 1 verbal ability,
r(61) ⫽ .27, p ⬍ .05. Representational change scores were most
strongly related to later emotion understanding, r(65) ⫽ .37, p ⬍

r(61) ⫽ .42, p ⬍ .01. (Bivariate correlations with appearance–
reality, false belief, and perspective taking were .16, .08, and .21,
respectively.)

Assessment of Self-Perception (Time 2)

The mean scores for children’s self-report of their perceived
competence for the four domains were as follows: cognitive abil-
ity, 3.31 (SD ⫽ 0.56); physical ability, 3.36 (SD ⫽ 0.47); peer
relations, 2.90 (SD ⫽ 0.63); and relationship with the mother, 2.58
(SD ⫽ 0.56). The four measures were intercorrelated (Cronbach’s
␣ ⫽ .63, average item–total correlation ⫽ .41). We therefore
computed aggregate self-perception scores for the analyses in
addition to the scores for the four separate domains. Higher scores
on the composite measure represented greater perceived self-
competence overall. There were no sex differences on these self-
perception measures, and they were not related to age or Time 1
verbal ability.

Assessment of Personality (Time 2)

The personality assessment was based on parent responses on
the CCQS. According to the final sort, the child receives a score
from 1 to 9 for each of the 100 items. For instance, if a parent put
the item “He gets along well with others” in Category 8, the child
received a score of 8 for that item. In this way, the sorted items are
essentially converted into scores that resemble 9-point Likert-scale
ratings, except that there is a uniform, intra-individual distribution
of ratings across items. The result is a set of 100 ratings (one for
each item) for each child. The CCQS can be used in several
different ways to measure dimensions of personality and/or tem-
perament. In this study, we used these data to compute scores that
indexed the “Little Five” factors of personality and the tempera-
ment constructs of ego resilience and ego control.

The “Little Five” Personality Factors

John et al. (1994) used the rational scale construction method to
develop five subscales from the CCQS corresponding to the di-

mensions described in the five factor model of adult personality.
Three independent judges rated each item on the CCQS according
to how closely it described each of the five factors of adult
personality. These ratings yielded 78 items that fit within the
appropriate categories (Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Extra-
version, Neuroticism, and Openness). Based on data from 350
Q-sorts performed by mothers about their young adolescent sons,
these groups of items were further refined on the basis of reliability
indices (Cronbach’s alpha). The remaining five subscales (called
the Little Five) include a total of 48 items. Table 6 gives adjective
descriptions of the Big Five factors of personality (based on the
adult literature) and examples of items included in the Little Five
subscales.

Scores for all of the items corresponding to each of the five
dimensions were averaged for each participant to create subscale
scores on the CCQS according to the Little Five index (John et al.,
1994). Internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) in this data set was
high: for Extraversion, ␣ ⫽ .75; Agreeableness, ␣ ⫽ .76; Consci-
entiousness, ␣ ⫽ .71; Neuroticism, ␣ ⫽ .67; and Openness, ␣ ⫽
.60. Parents’ ratings of their children’s personality according to the
Little Five index are shown Table 6. The distributions may be
skewed because of social desirability (higher scores on Agreeable-
ness and lower scores on Neuroticism). Time 1 verbal ability was
significantly correlated with Neuroticism and with (lower) Agree-
ableness, rs(98) ⫽ .20 and ⫺.21, respectively, ps ⬍ .05. There
were no relations between personality and age or sex.

Ego Resilience and Ego Control

Following Block and Block (1980), we devised ego resilience
and ego control scores by correlating each child’s Q-sort with the
scores of a hypothetical prototype child who typifies high ego
resilience or ego undercontrol (i.e., poor ego control). Scores for
these measures could range from –1.0 to 1.0, with higher numbers
representing closer resemblance to the prototypes of these two
constructs. The means for ego resilience and ego undercontrol
were .51 (SD ⫽ .19; range ⫽ ⫺.18 to .78) and .06 (SD ⫽ .18,
range ⫽ ⫺.33 to .63), respectively. Ego resilience and ego under-
control were negatively correlated with each other, r(100) ⫽ ⫺.27,

p ⬍ .01. There were no significant relations with age, sex, or

Relations Between the Four Types of Assessments

Relation Between Fantasy and Emotion Understanding/
Theory of Mind

At age 4, there was a significant relation between role-play
measures and theory of mind, and thus we predicted that role-play
measures at Time 2 would be related to emotion understanding.
This prediction was supported only for impersonation. Specifi-
cally, the group of children who received scores of 0 on imper-
sonation because they or their parents reported no impersonation
(n ⫽ 13) scored significantly lower on the emotion understanding
composite (M ⫽ .42, SD ⫽ .25) than did the children who received
impersonation scores of 1 (M ⫽ .65, SD ⫽ .22), t(91) ⫽ ⫺3.33,
p ⬍ .01. (Note that this test is based on the 93 out of 100 children
for whom there were both impersonation and emotion understand-
ing scores.) This result cannot be explained by verbal ability
because the two groups did not differ significantly on Time 1
PPVT–R scores: no impersonation, M ⫽ 107.85, SD ⫽ 12.05;
impersonation, M ⫽ 108.53, SD ⫽ 12.53.

Next we examined longitudinal predictions between fantasy,
theory of mind, and emotion understanding. Neither imaginary
companion status nor impersonation at Time 1 significantly pre-
dicted emotion understanding scores at Time 2 (either in the total
sample or in the age-group subsets). However, there was a trend
for children who did not impersonate at Time 2 to have had lower
theory of mind scores at Time 1: no impersonation, M ⫽ 5.71,
SD ⫽ 3.55; impersonation, M ⫽ 8.33, SD ⫽ 3.44; t(63) ⫽ ⫺1.90,
p ⫽ .06. This difference was significant for representational
change: no impersonation, M ⫽ 0.57, SD ⫽ 1.13; impersonation,
M ⫽ 1.93, SD ⫽ 1.23; t(63) ⫽ 2.79, p ⬍ .01. Theory of mind
performance at Time 1 was not related to Time 2 imaginary
companion status.

Relation Between Fantasy and Self-Perception

Given Singer and Singer’s (1981) finding that high-fantasy
children were particularly likely to get along well with others, we
predicted that children who engaged in role play might score
higher than other children in their perceived social competence.
However, the self-perception scales were not related to the role-
play measures. In addition, the role-play measures at Time 1 were
unrelated to children’s self-perceptions at Time 2. This result
replicates and extends Harter and Chao’s (1992) finding that
preschool children with and without imaginary companions do not
differ in their perceived competence.

Relation Between Fantasy and Personality

The findings of past research have yielded mixed results con-
cerning how fantasy behavior is related to personality character-
istics. For example, some research has suggested that children with
imaginary companions are less shy than other children (Mauro,
1991), whereas other research has reported no difference in shy-
ness (Manosevitz et al., 1973). In her review of the literature on
imaginary companions, Taylor (1999) concluded that there tend to
be few differences in personality variables between children with

and without imaginary companions. However, no previous re-
search has included a complete assessment both of role-play be-
havior and the five factor model of personality.

Here we examined (a) the concurrent relations between person-
ality dimensions assessed by the CCQS (Extraversion, Agreeable-
ness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism, Openness, ego resilience,
and ego undercontrol) and fantasy behavior and (b) the longitudi-
nal relations between early engagement in fantasy and later scores
on the CCQS. There were no significant relations between the
CCQS and the concurrent measures of fantasy behavior (CFI,
imaginary companion, and impersonation scores).

Next we examined whether earlier engagement in fantasy was
related to the CCQS personality dimensions. In the 4-year-old
subset (Time 1), having a high impersonation score predicted
Openness scores on the personality measure: r(64) ⫽ .35, p ⬍ .01;
with Time 1 verbal ability controlled, r(60) ⫽ .33, p ⫽ .01. In the
3-year-old subset (Time 1), high impersonation predicted parent
ratings of children’s self-control (i.e., lower ego undercontrol):
r(35) ⫽ ⫺.39, p ⬍ .05; with Time 1 verbal ability controlled, r(32)
⫽⫺.40, p ⬍ .05. Although these results do not provide much
support for the view that role play is associated with positive
personality characteristics, there is no evidence that role play is
associated with negative characteristics. Overall, high-fantasy chil-
dren are more like other children than they are different from them.

Relation Between Emotion Understanding/Theory of Mind
and Ego-Control/Ego-Resilience

In several studies with preschool children, theory of mind has
been closely related to children’s inhibitory control (e.g., Carlson
& Moses, 2001). Inhibitory control is conceptually related to the
ego-control/ego-resilience constructs that are part of the CCQS
assessment. Thus, we predicted (a) a concurrent relation between
emotion understanding (our theory-of-mind-related measure for
Time 2) and ego-control/ego-resilience and (b) a longitudinal
relation between theory of mind (Time 1) and ego-control/ego-
resilience. There was little support for these predictions, apart from
a trend for theory of mind performance in preschool to predict ego
control (i.e., lower ego undercontrol scores), r(99) ⫽ ⫺.17, p ⬍
.10; with verbal ability controlled, r(95) ⫽ ⫺.18, p ⬍ .10.

Discussion

This research contributes new information about the develop-
mental course of
imaginary companions and impersonation,
middle-childhood links between role play and social understand-
ing, and the personality correlates of fantasy behavior.

Imaginary Companions

First and foremost, our study provides new insight into the
phenomenon of
imaginary companions and challenges some
widely held assumptions. On the basis of past research with
preschool children, we estimated that about 28% of children create
imaginary companions, that girls create them more often than
boys, and that about half are invisible and the rest are based on
toys. It is also often claimed that the peak age for play with
imaginary companions is about 4 years and that most imaginary
companions are given up by age 6 when children start school. The

results of this study challenge these generalizations about imagi-
nary companions on all counts.

In our sample of 6- and 7-year-old children, 65% were catego-
rized as having or having had an imaginary companion. Thirty-one
percent of these children were currently playing with imaginary
companions. Clearly this is a very common type of pretend play
that is not abandoned as early as previously supposed. The exact
estimate for the incidence of imaginary companions depends on
the methods and criteria used to identify them. Some of the choices
we made in this study could be controversial. For example, we
excluded cases in which the parents reported that their children had
imaginary companions if the children denied this report. We in-
cluded cases in which the imaginary companions were based on
stuffed animals or toys, as well as imaginary companions that were
invisible. Although we and others (e.g., Gleason et al., 2000) have
argued that stuffed animals sometimes function as legitimate imag-
inary companions, the decision about whether a toy counts as an
imaginary companion is not always straightforward, and some
researchers have been reluctant to include stuffed animals. If we
limit our definition of imaginary companions to just the invisible
ones, the estimate for prevalence up to the age of 7 years is 37%.
Most studies of children’s imaginary companions have found
that girls are more likely to have imaginary companions than are
boys (Carlson & Taylor, in press; Hurlock & Burnstein, 1932;
Mauro, 1991; but see D. G. Singer & Singer, 1990). According to
Carlson and Taylor (in press), this sex difference might be due to
the types rather than the amount of role play that boys and girls
prefer. Carlson and Taylor found that boys were as likely to invent
imaginary characters as girls were; however, many of the imagi-
nary characters created by preschool boys were impersonated
rather than treated as imaginary companions. Ames and Learned
(1946) also found that many boys engaged in impersonation, and
these authors suggested that boys prefer this type of play to
imaginary companions. In any case, the results of this study
indicate that the sex difference in the incidence of imaginary
companions for preschool children is no longer evident by age 7.
Although preschool boys often impersonate the characters they
create rather than treat them as another person, by 7 years of age,
boys are as likely as girls to report a history of having had an
imaginary companion.

What accounts for this developmental change in the kind of role
play boys enjoy? We suspect part of this change is related to the
functions served by imaginary companions at different ages. Pre-
school boys’ preference for impersonating created characters
makes sense when one considers an interesting sex difference
found in the types of roles boys and girls adopt in their play. Boys
are more likely than girls to adopt fantastic or active roles (e.g.,
monsters, spacemen), whereas girls are more likely to adopt roles
to engage in pretend play about
relationships (Fein, 1981;
McLoyd, Warren, & Thomas, 1984). Thus, the sociodramatic play
of boys is less dependent on having other characters in the scene,
and girls’ fantasy roles might be more conducive to the creation of
imaginary companions. Perhaps these preferences change by age 7
or boys become better able to incorporate relationships into fan-
tastic superhero pretense. However, the current data do not allow
for more than post hoc speculation about developmental change in
the functions of imaginary companions.

One of the goals of this research was to determine what happens
to imaginary companions—why children stop playing with them.

This goal reflected our assumption that most of the children in the
present study would have given up play with imaginary compan-
ions by age 7. We were wrong. Altogether, 31 of the imaginary
companions described at Time 2 were current ones rather than
ones that the children had at an earlier time. Thus an even higher
percentage of children were playing with imaginary companions at
the school-age assessment (31%) than had been found at the
preschool assessment (28%). This result was surprising given that
several major developmental theories have downplayed the role of
fantasy play in school-age children. It is possible that imaginary
companions continue to be a major vehicle of fantasy throughout
childhood. Adults (e.g., parents, researchers) are less aware of the
imaginary companions because more of them are invisible and
older children are less overt in their play with them (Newson &
Newson, 1976). In fact, in this sample, 27% of the children
described an imaginary companion that their parents did not know
existed. One 7-year-old explicitly requested that we not tell her
mother about the imaginary companion she had described to us.
In addition to the current imaginary companions of the school-
age children, a substantial number of imaginary companions had
come and gone by age 7, and thus we were able to ask about the
reasons they had been abandoned. However, for the most part,
neither the children nor the parents could provide any explana-
tions. Imaginary companions appear to be given up in much the
same way as other activities or toys. Children simply lose interest
and turn to other types of activities. In some cases, children replace
the old imaginary companion with a new one who has a different
set of characteristics.

Another goal of this research was to learn more about the later
correlates of this type of play in early childhood. Here we inves-
tigated the possibility that having an imaginary companion in the
past or present might be related to emotion understanding, a
variety of personality variables, and/or perceived competence at
age 7. However, there were very few differences between the
children who did and did not have an imaginary companion on any
of these variables.

Why did so few variables correlate with having a history of
imaginary companions at age 7? One problem is that the category
“having an imaginary companion” is very broad. The children who
were grouped together in this study as “having an imaginary
companion” were a very diverse group, including, for example, a
girl who had invented an imaginary version of her favorite friend
at preschool and then regularly played with her “fake” friend for 3
years, a girl who at age 6 shared her thoughts and feelings with an
invisible green dog, and a boy who at age 3 invented a tiny white
boy who could not be seen because he lived in lights. Our descrip-
tive data suggest that children’s imaginary companions do not fall
into neat categories with respect to their physical characteristics,
personality, function, or anything else. Even identifying the gender
of an imaginary companion is not straightforward. In addition to
males and females, there are imaginary companions that specifi-
cally do not have a gender, ones whose gender is unknown, and
ones that can switch genders. The diversity of this type of play
presents challenges to researchers who would like to find out how
having an imaginary companion is related to social understanding,
theory of mind, personality, or other variables of interest.

A more fine-grained analysis of imaginary companions will be
required to learn more about their effects on cognitive and social
development. Gleason (2002) has taken a step in this direction by

TAYLOR, CARLSON, MARING, GEROW, AND CHARLEY

social

examining the kinds of relationships children have with imaginary
friends compared with real friends. Here we collected data relevant
to the dimension of conventional or ordinary versus exotic or
fantastic because there is evidence that in social role play, fantastic
themes (roles the child would seldom or never enact in real life)
are related to greater
interaction and more meta-
communications (McLoyd et al., 1984). Similarly, content differ-
ences in pretense have also been shown to be related to children’s
understanding of pretending as a mental as well as a physical
activity. In a variety of tasks, preschool children show more
awareness of pretending as involving the mind when the task
involves fantasy characters. For example, 4-year-old children are
likely to report that pretending to be the Lion King (a fantasy
character) involves the mind more than does pretending to be a dog
(an ordinary character; Lillard & Sobel, 1999; Sobel & Lillard,
2001). Flannery and Watson (1993) combined the exotic– ordinary
dimension with frequency in their categorization of children as
high, average, or low in fantasy as observed in free play with other
children. These studies focused on preschool children and different
types of pretending rather than on interacting with an imaginary
companion, but the results suggested that the ordinary– exotic
dimension of imaginary companions was worth investigation.
However, in this study with school-age children, there were only a
few findings related to the exotic– ordinary ratings of imaginary
companions. High impersonation at Time 1 predicted exotic imag-
inary companions at Time 2, and having an exotic imaginary
companion was associated with higher scores on the Fanciful and
Frequency scales of the CFI and higher self-perception scores.

In addition to variation in the content and theme, the context in
which role play occurs is also important to investigate. Although
we have learned that imaginary companions are sometimes shared
with other friends and family members, children who interact with
imaginary companions are typically engaging in solitary play. The
predominantly private nature of imaginary companions, especially
for older children, contrasts with impersonation, which we suspect
lends itself to social situations. In the social play of preschoolers,
many episodes of pretense are initiated by children taking on a role
or assigning a role to another child. For example, Lloyd and
Goodwin (1995) found that claiming a role for oneself (e.g., “And
I’m a robber and I’m going to steal all the things”) accounted for
58.5% of the pretend utterances in the play sessions for a group of
children between the ages of 4 years 2 months and 4 years 6
months. Impersonation can be enjoyed as a solitary activity, and
imaginary companions can be shared with other children, but
perhaps the stronger connection with social activity accounts for
some of our findings related to impersonation. However, this
speculation rests on observational studies of preschool children.
Less is known about the patterns of social and private pretense in
older children, partly because it has been widely claimed that
pretend play declines after about 5 years of age (e.g., F. P. Hughes,
1999).

Impersonation

The results of our research indicate that impersonation needs
more careful study. Here our primary focus was on imaginary
companions, but the results related to impersonation, even given
our crude measurement, were interesting. At first glance, simply
asking children and parents about impersonation did not seem very

informative because most answered “yes.” We did not anticipate
that so many children would continue to endorse the impersonation
items at age 7, so we did not ask many questions about
it.
However, it is possible that impersonation is not restricted to early
childhood.

Interpretation of the Time 2 impersonation results is speculative
because of the small number of children who were categorized as
not being high in impersonation. However, it was intriguing that
these children were different on a number of measures. The rela-
tion between Time 2 impersonation and emotion understanding
suggests that not impersonating characters might have implications
for children’s ability to understand the emotional dispositions of
others. As Bretherton (1989) has convincingly argued, pretense
provides opportunities to help children regulate emotions. Perhaps
trying on a variety of perspectives in the realm of fantasy might
facilitate real-world perspective-taking abilities as well. However,
it is also possible that children who are not adept at taking the
emotional perspective of another person are also not inclined to
impersonate in their play. This interpretation is consistent with the
finding that the children who did not perform well on theory of
mind tasks in preschool were more likely to be in the small group
of children who were in the low-impersonation category at the
school-age assessment. It would be interesting to explore these
possibilities in future research with a more sensitive measure of
impersonation.

Most research on imaginary companions and on impersonation
has been conducted separately. In our own research, impersonation
has been secondary to our primary interest in imaginary compan-
ions. However, Harris (2000) has recently argued for a strong
conceptual relation between imaginary companions and imperson-
ation, and we believe that in future research, impersonation should
be given equal emphasis with imaginary companions. However, it
will be a challenge to develop a measurement instrument that
makes the important distinctions between the type of role play that
almost all children enjoy from time to time and the types of
intensive impersonation activity in which some children take on an
elaborated role on a regular basis. For example, we know of one
child who developed an identity he called Super Lightning Bolt
Aidan. This identity started to make regular appearances after
Aidan became frightened by a thunder and lightning storm. When
he assumed this identity, he wore a cape and a mask and he talked
and behaved with assurance and power. We suspect that this is the
sort of impersonation (i.e., an elaborated and idiosyncratic identity
assumed regularly, as contrasted with varied roles that are assumed
from time to time in social games of pretense with other children)
that is most closely linked with having an imaginary companion.

Theory of Mind and Emotion Understanding

Although understanding of belief and understanding of emotion
are both important for successful social interaction, the relation
between these domains is not well understood. Some studies have
found that false belief scores are correlated with empathy (Asting-
ton & Jenkins, 1995) and that preschool children understand the
relation between beliefs and emotional reactions (Harris, Johnson,
Hutton, Andrews & Cooke, 1989; Wellman & Banerjee, 1991). C.
Hughes and Dunn (1998) found that understanding of false belief
and understanding of emotion were related to each other between
47 and 60 months of age. In a study with preadolescents, Bosacki

and Astington (1999) included questions about emotional reactions
as part of their composite theory of mind measure. However,
Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Tesla, and Youngblade (1991) did not
find a relation between their emotion understanding and false
belief tasks at 40 months. They attributed this partly to the children
being too young to provide a range of scores on false belief.
Cutting and Dunn (1999) also failed to find a relation between
emotion understanding and false belief understanding in 4-year-
old children. They interpreted their findings as suggesting that
emotion understanding and false belief are perhaps more distinct
domains of social cognition than has previously been supposed.
However, in this study, children’s theory of mind at age 4 was
related to their understanding of emotions 3 years later at ages 6 –7.
What accounts for the differences between our results and those
reported by Cutting and Dunn (1999)? One possibility is that
differences in the way theory of mind was measured in the two
studies are at least partly responsible. We included 13 theory of
mind tasks that included three representational change tasks. The
composite scores were significantly correlated with emotion un-
derstanding, but of the individual task types, only representational
change was significantly correlated with emotion understanding
when Time 1 verbal ability was controlled. It is interesting that the
representational change component of Cutting and Dunn’s false
belief composite had to be excluded from their analysis because of
irregularity in the methodology. A question raised by these results
is the extent to which there might be something unique about
reflecting on mental-state changes in the self that contributes to
emotion understanding. Perhaps further speculation about
this
issue should await replication of the finding.

Conclusions

One of the lessons to be learned from this research is that
fantasy is alive and well in the lives of school-age children. In fact,
play with imaginary companions was at least as prevalent in our
school-age sample as in preschool children. We were able to
collect interesting descriptions of these imaginary companions
created by older children and discover new information about
them. For example, the majority of imaginary companions played
with by older children are invisible, whereas in younger children at
least half are based on props such as special toys. In addition, the
sex difference in incidence that is well established in preschool
children is no longer present by age 7. As many boys as girls have
a history of role play involving imaginary companions. The imag-
inary companions that were no longer played with by age 7 appear
to have been given up gradually with little fanfare. The descrip-
tions of the imaginary companions were diverse and often highly
imaginative, but we suspect that interviews focused more specif-
ically on how imaginary companions function in the children’s
lives would be useful for investigating the developmental corre-
lates of this type of role play for school-age children.

Impersonation needs to be investigated more thoroughly in
future research. Although we did not collect much information
about it, there were nevertheless some interesting results. In par-
ticular, our finding of a relation between low impersonation at age
7 and lower scores both on emotion understanding at age 7 and
theory of mind at age 4 deserves further study. In addition, our
findings of relations between theory of mind at age 4 and emotion
understanding and ego control at age 7 are contributions to the

literature on the development of social understanding. Exactly how
the role-play activities of older children contribute to and are
affected by their social cognitive development awaits future study,
but the appreciation gained in this research for the fantasy lives of
school-age children is an important step.
