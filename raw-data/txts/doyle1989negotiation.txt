Negotiation  and  Enactment  in  Social  Pretend  Play: 
Relations  to  Social Acceptance 
and  Social  Cognition

Pretend  play  with  peers has been hypothesized to  augment  the social and 
social-cognitive  skills of  preschool  children.  Two  alternative  mechanisms 
for  these  effects  are  proposed:  first,  out-of-play  negotiations  with  play 
partners about  roles, object  properties,  and actions;  and second, the actual 
enactment  of  pretend  episodes. The  frequency  of  negotiation  and  enact- 
ment  of  pretend  was observed in 62 boys and  girls during  free play in three 
day  care centers. The  relation  of  these pretend  components  to  each other 
and  to  indices of  social acceptance by peers and  affective  role-taking  were 
evaluated.  Negotiation  and  enactment  were positively correlated,  and both 
predicted  peer  social  acceptance.  Enactment  predicted  peer  acceptance 
independent  of  negotiation,  but  the reverse was not true.  These findings in- 
dicate that  pretend  enactment  was an essential feature  of  the observed rela- 
tion  between social pretend  play and social competence and that  negotiation 
skills were invariably  practiced  during  such enactment.  Thus,  the  value of 
providing  preschool environments  that  encourage children  to  engage spon- 
taneously  in  the  enactment  of  pretend  scripts is supported. 

Engaging 
in  social  pretend  play  has been  linked  to  the  development  of  young 
children’s  social  competencies  (Garvey,  1977;  Singer,  1973;  Vygotsky,  1976). 
Experimental 
in  pre- 
tend  play  can  enhance  children’s  role-taking  skills  (Fink,  1976;  Saltz &  John- 
1977;

An  alternative  explanation

and  social  competence  has recently  been  suggested.  On  the  basis of  the  work

of  Piaget  (1962),  pretend  activity 
to  social 
development  by  providing  a context 
for  peer  negotiation  and  the  resolution 
of  conflict  (Rubin,  1980;  Rubin,  Fein,  & Vandenberg,  1983).  That  is, through
