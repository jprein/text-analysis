Chronic friendlessness in childhood predicts adverse mental health outcomes through-
out life, yet its earliest roots are poorly understood. In theory, developing a theory of
mind (ToM) should help children gain mutual friends and one preschool study (Peterson &
Siegal, 2002. Br J Dev Psychol, 20, 205) suggested a cross-sectional connection. We
therefore used a 2-year prospective longitudinal design to explore ToM as a predictor of
mutual friendship in 114 children from age 5 to 7 years after controlling potential
confounds including language ability and group popularity. Conﬁrming friendship’s
distinctiveness from group sociometric status, numerous group-rejected children (53%)
had a mutual friend whereas 23% of those highest in group status did not. Five-year-olds
with a mutual friend signiﬁcantly outperformed their friendless peers on a comprehensive
ToM battery (basic and advanced false belief). Longitudinally, chronically friendless
7-year-olds (no friends at either testing time) stood out for their exceptionally poor Time
1 ToM understanding even after controlling for group popularity, age, and language skill.
Extending previous evidence of ToM’s predictive links with later social and cognitive
outcomes, these results for mutual friendship suggest possible interventions to help
reduce the lifelong mental health costs of chronic friendlessness.

‘Without friends no one would choose to live, though he had all the other goods’ wrote
Aristotle (384–322 BC; 2007). Indeed, numerous studies link the problem of being
‘friendless’ or ‘chumless’ with a host of adverse mental health outcomes including low
self-worth, social anxiety, depression, loneliness, and suicidal or paranoid ideation (e.g.,
Bagwell, Newcomb, & Bukowski, 1998; Pedersen, Vitaro, Barker, & Borge, 2007).
Furthermore, the negative impact of friendlessness on emotional and psychological
well-being applies both during childhood (e.g., Parker & Asher, 1993) and throughout
adolescence (Ladd & Troop-Gordon, 2003; Pedersen et al., 2007). Even in adulthood,
childhood friendlessness has signiﬁcant adverse long-term repercussions for mental
health (Bagwell et al., 1998). Ladd and Troop-Gordon (2003) found that chronic
friendlessness (developing between kindergarten and third grade) longitudinally
predicted pre-adolescent loneliness and psychological disorder even after controlling
statistically for other predictors like rejection by the peer group. Nangle, Erdley, Newman,

Elian Fink et al.

Mason, and Carpenter (2003) found that children’s feelings of loneliness and depression
were a direct function of not having a reciprocated friendship whereas group popularity
was only indirectly inﬂuential. In a 12-year longitudinal study, Bagwell et al. (1998) found
that even after controlling for contemporaneous mental health predictors (e.g., job
success), a young adult’s having had no mutual friends in childhood uniquely predicted
adult psychopathology (especially depression). The same was not true for sociometric
group popularity.

Conversely, children who are lucky enough to have at least one mutual friend are
buffered against adverse effects of such negative situations in the wider peer group as
social isolation or peer rejection (e.g., Newcomb, Bagwell, Bukowski, & Hartup, 1998).
Again, this is true not only childhood but in adolescence and not only cross-sectionally
(e.g., Parker, Saxon, Asher, & Kovacs, 1999) but also longitudinally (Laursen, Bukowski,
Aunola, & Nurmi, 2007). Overall, friendship seems to protect children to a certain degree
against debilitating cycle of social isolation and personal maladjustment (Laursen et al.,
2007).

Consequently, it is crucial, not only for developmental theory but also from an applied
clinical perspective, to discover what the early roots of mutual friendship are and to ﬁnd
out what can cause, perpetuate or protect against chronic friendlessness. These are aims
of this study.

Friendship is distinguished from other kinds of positive situations with peers by its
reciprocated, mutual character. By deﬁnition, friendship is a dyadic bond. Each friend
needs to single the other out for special regard, and this entails mutual liking not just social
convenience or one-way admiration. Furthermore, substantial evidence shows that
sociometric popularity in the peer group differs from mutual friendship. Many children
who are disliked or ignored by the group in general have at least one best friend and are
satisﬁed with this friendship situation (Parker & Asher, 1993). Conversely, some children
who are group ‘popularity stars’ (earning more sociometric preference votes than most of
their peers) have no mutual friends at all and feel lonely and dissatisﬁed (Parker & Asher,
1993; Renshaw & Asher, 1983).

Investigation into how young children forge and maintain their ﬁrst mutual friendships
is crucial not only for theories of how of close relationships develop (e.g., Noller, Feeney,
& Peterson, 2001) but also because, in contrast to a large research literature on group
popularity (see Rubin, Bukowski, & Parker, 2006; for a review), there has been very little
study of reciprocated friendship, especially in children under age 8. Even cross-sectional
studies are few (but see Peterson & Siegal, 2002), and no known past studies have
explored the earliest roots of chronic friendlessness longitudinally, despite evidence from
older groups showing the adverse long-term impact of later friendship failure on
adolescent and adult mental health (e.g., Bagwell et al., 1998).

Therefore, owing to the central and unique signiﬁcance of mutual friendship for
lifelong psychological adjustment, we began where reciprocated friendships themselves
often begin, namely in the ﬁrst year of a child’s full-day compulsory schooling at age 5. Our
goal was to examine aspects of children’s social understanding (Dunn, 1995; Harris, 2006)
and other control variables as possible predictors and correlates of reciprocated
friendship both cross-sectionally in initial friendship formation (Hughes & Dunn, 2002)
and longitudinally as factors in friendship stability versus friendlessness. Owing to its
applied as well as theoretical signiﬁcance, we were particularly interested in the
development of chronic long-term friendlessness.

We chose social understanding of theory of mind (ToM) as a likely predictor of
reciprocated friendship for both theoretical and empirical reasons. ToM is the child’s

Friendlessness and ToM 3

awareness that people’s behaviour is shaped by their inner thoughts and feelings even
when these are at odds with external reality (Wellman, 1990). Deemed one of the most
signiﬁcant developmental milestones of early childhood (Flavell, 2004), it is traditionally
assessed using standard inferential false belief (FB) tests requiring explicit predictions (via
speech, pointing etc.) about the actions or thoughts of protagonists with FBs that the child
being tested does not share. Assessed in this way, ToM understanding exhibits a major
conceptual shift from consistent failure at 3 years to consistent success by age 5 or 6
(Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). Although recent studies of infant visual ﬁxation have
claimed that infants as young as 10 months (Luo, 2011) or 15 months of age (Onishi &
Baillargeon, 2005) already understand FBs, it is unclear how best to interpret this infant
looking-time data (Low & Perner, 2012). Rather than an implicit ToM already being
present in the ﬁrst year of life, an alternative view is that infants need only learn to perceive
regularities in agents’ overt behaviour to succeed on the looking-time measure (Ruffman,
Taumoepeau, & Perkins, 2012).

Theoretically, Hughes, and Dunn (1998) proposed that cognitive ToM understanding
should facilitate friendship formation. They found indirect evidence for this in a signiﬁcant
correlation between ToM scores and young playmates’ use of mentalistic terms in
informal conversation. Empirically, the strongest evidence for a speciﬁc link (albeit a
cross-sectional one) between mutually reciprocated friendship and ToM emerged from
the sole (to our knowledge) previous study (Peterson & Siegal, 2002) in which the two
constructs were examined together. Peterson and Siegal (2002) tested 4-year-old
preschoolers and found that even after taking account of general language ability and
group sociometric status as popular or rejected, those preschoolers who had at least one
mutual friend scored higher on ToM tests than their peers who had none.

that

Other prospective longitudinal studies suggest

individual differences in
5-year-olds’ ToM scores relate to a range of behavioural outcomes. For example, Renouf
et al. (2010) found that ToM at age 5 predicted direct and indirect physical aggression at
age 6, as assessed by the Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scale (PKBS: Merrell,
1995). Also using the PKBS, Razza and Blair (2009) found a link between classroom social
skills (e.g., ‘attempts new tasks before asking for help’) and 5-year-olds’ ToM, although
language ability and executive functioning (EF) skills were additional predictors.
McAlister and Peterson (2013) likewise found that ToM understanding at age 4–5 years
longitudinally predicted EF skills at ages 5–6 and that this was true even after controlling
for language and initial EF skill. Lecce, Caputi, and Pagnin (2014) found that ToM at age 5
longitudinally predicted academic achievement at age 7 although the effect was mediated
by sensitivity to teachers’ criticism. Similarly, Caputi, Lecce, Pagnin, and Banerjee (2012)
found that an association between ToM at age 5 and sociometric group popularity at age 7
was mediated by prosocial helpfulness as reported by teachers. As a ﬁnal example,
Banerjee, Watling, and Caputi (2011) used a faux-pas recognition test, rather than FB, as
the 5-year-old ToM index and found bidirectional and cyclic longitudinal associations with
sociometric rejection by the peer group between ages 5 and 9, suggesting that adverse
group relations may impair mastery of ToM just as poor ToM understanding may lead to
increased group rejection.

Thus, it is clear that, in broad terms, there are connections between 5-year-olds’ ToM
scores and many other cognitive, academic, and social variables besides friendship. In
theory, reciprocated friendship might also contribute to, and be assisted by, the
development of explicit ToM. Children could gain insight into another person’s thoughts
in unique ways by sharing the intimacy of a reciprocated friendship. At the same time, an
already sound ToM understanding could assist the forging of mutual friendships in the ﬁrst

4

place. Like other close relationships, friendship requires awareness of how friends’
perspectives differ from one’s own (Noller et al., 2001). Therefore, in theory, having
sound ToM skills upon entering the arena of initial friendship formation (e.g., with the
transition to full-day peer contact in school) could prove to be an asset for attracting
friends and understanding their thoughts and feelings well enough to keep the
relationship going. Conversely, being less capable than average at appreciating others’
perspectives could plausibly interfere with early friendship formation at age 5 and/or with
the challenges inherent in sustaining it over time.

Yet no previous study has examined ToM longitudinally as predictor of mutual
friendship. Indeed, even cross-sectionally, only one previous study (Peterson & Siegal,
2002) has examined their interconnection (see above). Thus, our main goal was to
examine ToM as a prospective longitudinal predictor of reciprocated friendship versus
friendlessness in the early years of primary school. Drawing upon theory in the absence of
previous longitudinal evidence to go on, we predicted that early mastery ToM
understanding would position children well for forging friendships in the ﬁrst place
and for maintaining these over time. Thus, ToM at age 5 should prospectively predict
consistently reciprocated friendship status at age 7. We also anticipated cross-sectional
links at age 5, building on Peterson and Siegal’s (2002) similar ﬁndings for 4-year-olds.

In addition to ToM, we assessed ﬁve additional possible predictors at age 5 to see
whether they might relate to children’s mutual friendship status at age 5 and/or age 7,
namely: (a) emotion understanding, (b) spontaneous helpfulness/prosocial behaviour, (c)
ability to delay gratiﬁcation (d) verbal ability and (e) sociometric popularity status within
the peer group as a whole. The rationale for inclusion of these variables was twofold. First
from a control perspective, it was of interest to see whether any links we might observe
between early ToM and later friendship reciprocity would be direct ones versus the
product of joint connections with other variables as in the case of Lecce et al.’s (2014) and
Caputi et al.’s (2012) prospective longitudinal studies. In addition, we were interested in
these variables as possible friendship correlates in their own right. Although there has
been little or no previous study of most of them in relation to young children’s mutual
friendship (even cross-sectionally), several past studies suggest possible links to ToM, as
described in more detail below. Hence, it was important for the sake of our predictions
and interpretations to be able to control them statistically. Furthermore, despite lack of
any direct past empirical evidence, there were theoretical grounds in each case for a
possible association with mutual friendship formation versus friendlessness, as we now
outline.

Emotion understanding (EU) involves detection of, and insight into, affective states
such as anger, joy or sadness (Harris et al., 1989). Initial past evidence from a similar age
group (Dunn, 1995) showed EU scores to be unrelated to ToM scores on FB tests,
suggesting the value of examining both separately as complementary indices of early
social cognition. Unlike ToM, Dunn (1995) also found in the same study that EU scores at
40 months prospectively predicted attitudes to school at age 6. Children with advanced
EU skills for affective perspective taking were more positive about the overall school
experience (including the classroom peer group) at the end of ﬁrst grade. By contrast,
Hughes and Dunn (1998) did ﬁnd a signiﬁcant overall correlation between EU and ToM in
preschoolers although there were numerous inconsistencies among patterns for
individual tasks within and across domains. No known study has examined EU in relation
to reciprocated mutual friendship in this age group. Nevertheless, in theory, it seems
plausible that children who readily understand others’ positive and negative emotions
should be well placed to resolve disputes, offer support, and generally forge early

Friendlessness and ToM 5

friendships that are amenable to mutual reciprocation. Thus, despite less past evidence
than in the case of ToM, we tentatively hypothesized that friendless children would score
lower than others in EU.

inclusion of

We also naturalistically observed and coded spontaneous helpfulness to peers in a
free play session given at age 5. Our
this variable was largely
exploratory for our chosen age group although McGuire and Weisz (1982) had found
more spontaneously helpfulness to peers during school recess by 12-year-olds who
had a mutual friend than by friendless youths. False belief understanding of ToM has
also been shown to correlate with prosocial behaviour in some past research (e.g.,
Caputi et al., 2012). Yet other studies have tested for a link and reported null
ﬁndings (e.g., Travis, Sigman, & Ruskin, 2001). Thus, we made no speciﬁc
predictions but treated this variable as exploratory. On a similarly exploratory basis,
we included delay of gratiﬁcation (DG), or ‘willpower’ (Mischel et al., 2010). While
no known study has linked this variable directly with mutual friendship, there is an
impressive body of longitudinal evidence from Mischel, Shoda, and Peake (1988) and
Mischel et al. (2010) linking it, as measured at age 4, to academic achievement,
career success, and mental health during adolescence and adulthood. Furthermore,
children who are able to postpone consumption of reward for the sake of later gain
might,
in theory, apply the same strategies in dyadic relationships to beneﬁt
reciprocal friendship.

Language ability is a well-known ToM correlate (see Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007;
for a relevant meta-analysis) and therefore was an important variable to include as a
control. We wanted to make sure that any links we might observe between ToM and
friendship were not accidental by-products of individual differences in language skill,
even though Peterson and Siegal (2002) had previously demonstrated language-indepen-
dent links between ToM and mutual friendship in 4-year-olds. Similarly, we included
sociometric group popularity as an important control variable, given its known links with
both ToM understanding (e.g., Banerjee, Watling, & Caputi, 2011) and mutual friendship
(Parker & Asher, 1993). Based on Peterson and Siegal, we predicted that links between
ToM at age 5 and mutual friendship at age 5 and age 7 would emerge independently of
group sociometric status, just as in the case of language.

Method

Participants
One hundred and fourteen children (58 boys) were recruited from the kindergarten
classes of three inner suburban schools in Sydney, Australia’s largest city. We chose the
kindergarten year as our longitudinal starting point as the ﬁrst year of compulsory
schooling in this community and hence the point at which many children gain their ﬁrst
exposure to full-day contact with a classroom peer group. In fact, even though short-term
friendships develop earlier, especially in those with some preschool experience (Hughes
& Dunn, 1998), there is surge in stable mutual friendship with school entry. Ladd and
Troop-Gordon (2003) found that chronic friendlessness likewise ﬁrst emerges between
kindergarten and third grade.

The children in our sample all had English as a native language, though representing a
mixture of ethnic backgrounds common to the area. None were seriously economically
disadvantaged. Reciprocated (mutual) friendships were assessed both initially (age 5) and
again 24 months later in a prospective longitudinal design. Mean age at Time 1 was

6

Elian Fink et al.

5.61 years (range: 4.5–6.42, SD = 0.42) and at Time 2 was 7.73 years (range: 6.67–8.50,
SD = 0.38). Both tests took place in Term 3 when familiarity with classmates was well
established. Eighteen children were unavailable at Time 2 owing to mobility. Thus, the
Time 2 sample comprised 96 children (an 85% retention rate) and included 49 boys. For
ethical reasons, we required active written parental informed consent for every child
together with the child’s own verbal assent. Our resultant response rate (68% of available
families consented) was high relative to other published sociometric research using
similarly ethically stringent recruitment methods (Hollmann & McNamara, 1999).

Measures

Verbal ability
The Test of Early Language Development (TELD-3: Hresko, Reid, & Hammill, 1999) was
individually administered to assess children’s verbal ability. Comprehensively measuring
lexical and syntactic skills both expressively and receptively, this norm-referenced test
has been widely used in ToM research (Milligan et al., 2007) and has excellent
psychometric properties and convergent validity with other published language tests. We
used raw (unstandardized) scores in statistical analyses to permit independent analysis of
chronological age effects.

ToM/False belief
Our six item FB battery included four ﬁrst-order and two advanced FB tests. The ﬁrst-order
set had two unexpected contents tasks based on Perner, Leekam, and Wimmer (1987) and
two changed location tasks similar to Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith’s (1985). For the two
advanced FB measures, we drew on Hughes et al.’s (2000) reasoning that a more
sophisticated grasp of ToM is required when a task demands that one mental state (e.g.,
emotion) be inferred on the basis of another mental state (e.g., FB) than in the case of
ﬁrst-order FB where only a single mental state inference is required. Thus, like Hughes
et al. (2000), we chose emotion FB tests as our advanced ToM measures, a choice
supported by past empirical evidence (e.g., Harris, Johnson, Hutton, Andrews, & Cooke,
1989; Hughes et al., 2000) that emotion FB is not consistently passed until the age of
6 years or later. The speciﬁc emotion FB tasks we used were very similar to those of
Hughes et al. (2000).

All six tasks we chose have been widely used and validated (Milligan et al., 2007;
Wellman et al., 2001) and are shown to have good reliability and internal consistency
(e.g., Hughes et al., 2000). Tasks were narrated as story-book vignettes accompanied by
coloured drawings. Each had at least one test question about the protagonist’s FB,
belief-based action, or false-belief-based emotion plus one control question that also had to
be correct for a pass. A total FB score summed these six items and had sound internal
consistency: Cronbach’s a = .78.

Emotion understanding
Based on Pons, Harris, and de Rosnay (2004), three age-appropriate components of
emotion understanding (EU) were chosen from the Test of Emotion Comprehension
(TEC)
to assess EU. All components involved short vignettes about pictured
protagonists with test questions requiring choice from four pictured facial expres-

Friendlessness and ToM 7

sions. All components assessed positive and negative emotions equally. The
dimensions of emotion that were measured were (a) emotions based on diverse
desires, (b) emotions deriving from ignorance versus knowledge of reality, and (c) the
understanding hidden of emotion. There were two diverse desire tasks and four tasks
each for dimensions (b) and (c). All components assessed equal number of positive
and negative emotion scenarios.

We also incorporated two false-belief-based emotion tasks described above into the EU
total so that this initial 12-task total could (and did) yield scores from 0 to 12. Initial analysis
showed that one story of dimension (b) was uncorrelated with all other tasks, and it was
thus omitted from further analyses. Children thus received a possible EU score between 0
and 11. Cronbach’s test revealed acceptable internal consistency (a = .60), notwith-
standing the wide range of diverse constructs assessed.

Prosocial behaviour
Children’s prosocial behaviour was assessed during a free play session with two other
peers. The trio was ﬁlmed unobtrusively, with no adults in the room, for seven minutes
playing with a large toy zoo. Using Ensor and Hughes’ (2010) methods, ﬁve prosocial acts
were coded: Sharing, helping, comforting, praising, and attempting to alleviate peer
distress. Each could arise spontaneously or in response to a request. Inter-rater reliability
was good across all ﬁve categories: Cohen’s j = .73. Prosocial total scores (range: 0–8)
reﬂected overall helpfulness to peers during free play.

Delay of gratiﬁcation
Children’s ability to delay gratiﬁcation (DG) was assessed via eight sticker-choice trials
interspersed between FB and EU tests, using the procedure of Thompson, Barresi, and
Moore (1997). At the beginning of the session, children learned they would be collecting
stickers but could choose, ‘one sticker now or two for later’. Two envelopes were
prepared with the child’s name. The now envelope was handed to the child while the
experimenter kept their for later envelope out of sight. An array of stickers was shown at
each choice point. Children opting for immediate reward retained the sticker in their now
envelope. Those opting for delay received nothing in hand until the end of that day’s
session. Children’s choices were highly consistent across the eight trials: Cronbach’s
a = .90. A proportional DG score ranging from 0 to 1.00 was computed by dividing the
child’s total stickers by the maximum possible (16). A few children not completing all
trials received pro-rated scores based on the trials they had completed. Only two children
in this sample consistently opted for immediate reward. All others chose to delay on
between 50% and 100% of trials.

Sociometric peer preference
Group popularity was assessed using the sociometric interview technique developed by
Coie, Dodge, and Coppotelli (1982). This widely used test comprehensively assesses
children’s group popularity standing in their peer environment. Over 50% of each
classroom participated, thus meeting requirements for accurate sociometric assessment
(Schultz et al., 2004). Each child, interviewed individually with photographs, was asked
to nominate three children in their class that ‘you like to play with the most’, and three
children, ‘you do not like to play with’. Cross-gender nominations were permitted. To

8

Elian Fink et al.

account for the differing numbers of children in each classroom, ‘like most’ and ‘like least’
totals were standardized. The child’s standardized ‘like most’ total minus his/her
standardized ‘like least’ total yielded a sociometric peer preference score via the standard
method (Coie et al., 1982). Popular, average, and rejected categorical classiﬁcations were
derived likewise (Coie et al., 1982). Preference scores ranged from  3.59 to + 3.52 in
this sample, with a SD of 1.61.

Mutual (reciprocated) friendship
In a separate individual interview, children were asked to nominate their top three ‘best
friends’ in the class. Cross-gender nominations were permitted. Friendship tiers were
classiﬁed from 1 to 3 as follows:

Tier 1: Child and reciprocating friend choose each other as ﬁrst ‘best’ friend (n = 28).
Tier 2: At least one of the child’s three best friends reciprocates by including child in
their top three ‘bests’ (n = 53).
Tier 3: No reciprocated friend nomination for any of the top three friends (n = 33).

To assess comparability of the Tier 1 and 2 methods,
independent-samples t-tests
compared children deﬁned as ‘friended’ via the Tier 1 method with those so deﬁned via
Tier 2 on all focal Time 1 variables. No signiﬁcant differences emerged for any – That is age,
FB, EU, DG, prosocial behaviour, or Time 1 peer preference: All ts < 1.90, all ps = ns.
Thus, like Parker and Asher (1993), we used Tier 2 as our operational deﬁnition of
reciprocated mutual friendship on the grounds that this less restricted index has sound
empirical as well as ecological validity for an age group where multiple close friendships
are normative.

Change in friendship reciprocity from Time 1 to Time 2
Children’s friendship reciprocity was assessed at 7 years of age to determine changes in
friendship reciprocity over time. Combining Time 1 and Time 2 data yielded the following
four friendship reciprocity categories:

friend’.

+/+: Reciprocal friend at both Time 1 and Time 2 (n = 46); ‘stable mutual friend’.
 /+: No reciprocal friend at Time 1 but a reciprocal friend at Time 2 (n = 20); ‘gains
+/ : Reciprocal friend at Time 1 but no reciprocal friend at Time 2 (n = 21); ‘loses
 / : No reciprocal friend at either Time 1 and Time 2 (n = 9); ‘chronic friendless’.

friend’.

Procedure
Both in kindergarten when children were age 5 (Time 1), and again 24 months later in
second grade (Time 2), children were interviewed individually in a quiet room at school
using the best friend nomination protocol described above. In addition, at Time 1 only, in
two separate sessions no more than a week apart, children took the sociometric measure
of group popularity plus the tests of verbal ability, ToM, EU, and gratiﬁcation delay
described above. Task and trial orders were varied. Children were randomly assigned to
one of two task orders. In the ﬁnal Time 1 session, prosocial behaviour was observed
during group free play.

Results

Descriptive statistics and preliminary analyses
Table 1 shows means and SDs for all Time 1 predictor variables and their intercorrela-
tions. Girls displayed more prosocial acts (M = 2.76) than boys (M = 2.03), t(111) = 2.16,
p = .033, but gender was unrelated to any other Table 1 variable. Nor was it associated
with friended/friendless status at age 5, v2(1) <1, N = 114, p > .35. Thus, we combined
the genders to enhance power in the main statistical analyses. Age correlated only with
language and EU while DG was not related to any Time 1 variable.

Predicting mutual friendship versus friendlessness at Time 1
Table 2 shows children’s scores on Time 1 variables as a function of whether or not they
currently had a mutual friendship. Independent-samples t-tests showed that friendless
5-year-olds had signiﬁcantly lower verbal ability, lower ToM scores, less frequent DG,
lower group sociometric preference, and fewer spontaneous prosocial behaviours than
reciprocally friended children. However, there was no signiﬁcant difference in EU.
Comparing group sociometric status with reciprocal friendship at Time 1, our results
supported previous evidence from older children in showing the relative independence of
these two aspects of children’s peer relations even at age 5. For example, of the 35
sociometrically ‘popular’ children we tested, 8 (23%) had no mutual friendship. Even
more strikingly, 53% (16/30) of children who scored as ‘rejected’ by the peer group had at
least one mutual friend. Clearly friendship is different from group popularity in early
childhood, just as other research has shown it to be during middle childhood and
pre-adolescence (e.g., Parker & Asher, 1993).

Independent contributions of these signiﬁcant bivariate correlates of age 5 friendship
reciprocity were investigated using binary logistic regression (see Table 3). ‘Mutually
friended’ was the reference category, and Time 1 friendlessness was the outcome variable.
Owing to high correlations between verbal ability, ToM, and EU, an initial model was run
including only these variables. This model was signiﬁcant, v2
3(N = 112) = 11.10, p < .05,
Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .13, but only ToM made a signiﬁcant independent contribution.
As such, ToM was included in the ﬁnal model along with gratiﬁcation delay, prosocial
behaviour, and peer preference. The overall model was signiﬁcant, v2
4(N = 111) = 28.13,
p < .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .32 (see Table 3). Compared to those with mutual
friends, 5-year-olds without a reciprocal friendship scored signiﬁcantly lower in ToM
scores and gratiﬁcation delay. Expressed in SD increments, for every SD increase in DG,
likelihood of having a reciprocal friend rose 2.10 times. With each SD gain in ToM, the
likelihood of Time 1 mutual friendship rose 1.80 times.

Prospective longitudinal predictors of friendship situation at age 7
Table 4 shows means and SDs for children grouped according to combined friendship
patterns from age 5 to 7 years. Nine (9.4% of Time 2 children) remained chronically
friendless, with no mutual friendship either at the start or the end of the 2-year longitudinal
period. Another 46 had mutual friendships at both points. The remaining 41 changed
status, 19 moving from friendless to mutually friended and 22 moving the opposite way.
One-way ANOVAs followed by Tukey’s post-hoc tests (p < .05) compared these four
groups. Signiﬁcant group differences emerged for ToM understanding, F(3, 91) = 7.50,

p < .001, sociometric preference score, F(3, 91) = 10.18, p < .001, and frequency of
prosocial acts, F(3, 91) = 3.32, p < .05. In the case of ToM and sociometric preference,
pairwise Tukey’s test comparisons showed that the chronically friendless 7-year-olds
scored below all other groups who did not differ signiﬁcantly from one another. For
prosocial acts, the only difference was between the chronically friendless and those with
mutual friends at both times. Verbal ability (p > .60) and EU (p > .30) showed no
signiﬁcant group differences, whereas DG, although marginally signiﬁcant by ANOVA
(p < .05), yielded no statistically signiﬁcant pairwise contrasts via the more conservative
Tukey’s test (p = .067).

To see whether the link between low ToM understanding and chronic friendlessness
was independent of sociometric popularity with the group as a whole, an ANCOVA was
run with friendship status as the grouping variable, FB scores as the outcome variable, and
sociometric peer preference as the covariate. The result was statistically signiﬁcant, F(3,
90) = 5.35, p = .002. Thus, even after due allowance was made for popularity versus
rejection by the peer group as a whole, children who remained chronically friendless at
age 7 stood out for their signiﬁcantly poorer performance on FB tests of ToM 2 years
earlier at age 5.

Finally, we used multinomial logistic regression to further investigate simultaneous
predictors of patterns of change in friendship reciprocity over the 2 years. The reference
group was stable mutuality (mutually friended at Times 1 and 2: [+/+]). Due to the high
correlation between verbal ability, ToM, and EU, an initial control model was run
including only these variables. The resulting model was signiﬁcant, v2
9(N = 94) = 22.73,
p < .01, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .23. However, the only signiﬁcant predictor in this
model was ToM. As such, only ToM was included in the ﬁnal model. The latter examined
the simultaneous impact of gratiﬁcation delay, ToM, prosocial behaviour, and sociometric
preference on friendship reciprocity patterns from 5 to 7 years. This model was
signiﬁcant, v2
12(N = 93) = 57.50, p < .001, Nagelkerke pseudo-R2 = .50. As Table 5
shows, relative to the consistently friended group (+/+), children who remained without
friendships at either time ( / ) were signiﬁcantly lower in FB, sociometric group
reciprocally friended status (+/ ) was linked only with lower sociometric group

longitudinally. Expressed in terms of SD increments on Time 1 measures, for a single SD
increment in FB understanding, children were 3.7 times less likely to be classiﬁed  / 
compared to +/+ children. For each SD increment in sociometric group preference,
children were 2.7 times less likely to be classiﬁed +/ , and 7.3 times less likely to be
classiﬁed  /  relative to +/+ children. For each SD increase in DG, their odds of being +/+
rather than  /  or  /+ were 3.7 or 2.3 times greater, respectively.

Discussion
As we had predicted on the basis both of theory and of limited data from one previous
cross-sectional study of 4-year-olds (Peterson & Siegal, 2002), ToM understanding at age 5

Friendlessness and ToM 13

emerged as a strongly signiﬁcant predictor of children’s having or not having a mutually
reciprocated friendship both contemporaneously during initial friendship formation in
kindergarten and also longitudinally from age 5 to age 7. Furthermore, the prospective link
between ToM understanding at age 5 and having a mutual friend at age 7 remained
signiﬁcant even after controlling statistically for other related variables such as verbal
ability, EU, age, prosocial behaviour, and group sociometric status with peers. Children
who remained chronically friendless from age 5 through age 7 already stood out from the
three other longitudinal friendship categories at age 5 for their dramatically poorer ToM
understanding on ﬁrst-order and advanced FB tests.

While these ﬁndings for mutual friendship are novel, they add to a growing body of
evidence showing prospective longitudinal links between 5-year-olds’ cognitive under-
standing of ToM and other aspects of their social, emotional, and cognitive functioning in
school several years later. These include academic achievement (Lecce et al., 2014),
sensitivity to teachers’ criticism (Lecce, Caputi, & Hughes, 2011), aggressiveness to peers
(Renouf et al., 2010), classroom comportment skills (Razza & Blair, 2009), and popularity
status in the peer group (Banerjee et al., 2011). Our ﬁndings added importantly to this
picture by showing that an unusually slow start in the development of ToM understanding
at age 5 is also a powerful predictor of chronic friendlessness from age 5 through age 7. In
general, these longitudinal data conﬁrm that individual differences in how quickly
children master an understanding of others’ minds have demonstrable long-term
signiﬁcance not only for friendship but also for many other aspects of their social and
academic development well beyond preschool (Hughes & Leekam, 2004).

In addition to highlighting both the early and the later signiﬁcance of ToM
understanding for friendship, our contrasting results for other variables warrant
comment. At age 5, besides higher ToM, children with reciprocated friendships also
scored higher in verbal ability, prosocial behaviour, and gratiﬁcation delay. However, in
the prospective longitudinal data, only ToM stood out as a clearly signiﬁcant predictor of
chronic friendlessness. The 7-year-olds who never managed to forge a reciprocated
friendship throughout the study’s 2 years had been just as linguistically adept at age 5, just
as prosocially helpful to peers, just as skilled on EU tests, and not signiﬁcantly less capable
of delaying gratiﬁcation than their peers. Only their signiﬁcantly lower ToM understand-
ing predicted their future status as chronically friendless.

What could explain the special signiﬁcance of ToM as a prospective longitudinal
predictor of mutual friendship versus friendlessness? Or, to put it another way, why did
other variables we examined not emerge as clearly as ToM did in either the
contemporaneous or the longitudinal friendship correlations? The pattern for DG was
especially puzzling. At Time 1, children who would later gain a mutual friendship
longitudinally scored lower in DG than the chronically friendless (see Table 4). Also,
despite statistical signiﬁcance via logistic regression,
the DG contrast between
friendship status groups was uniformly non-signiﬁcant via more conservative Tukey’s
tests. One explanation for these inconsistent results could be our multitrial DG scoring
method (see Mischel et al., 1988, for a comparison of this with other commonly used
methods of testing for DG, such as forced choice). Averaging over multiple trials may
have contributed to the fact that a full 98% of our sample delayed gratiﬁcation on at
least 50% of their opportunities. For whatever reason, the fact that virtually all the
children in this sample opted to delay on at least some trials may well explain the
absence of clear associations for this variable as we measured it. Further research on
friendship and gratiﬁcation delay using other measurement techniques is clearly
warranted.

Measurement issues could also help explain the absence of a clear longitudinal
connection between prosocial behaviour and mutual friendship (and, for that matter, the
lack of a signiﬁcant contemporaneous correlation at age 5 between prosocial behaviour
and ToM). We measured prosocial behaviour directly via naturalistic observation of peers’
play, whereas most previous studies reporting signiﬁcant links with ToM have used a
proxy prosocial measure (parents’ or teachers’ scale ratings). Indeed, the one known
previous study that, like ours, used direct observational measurement likewise found no
signiﬁcant correlations with ToM in either an ASD group or non-ASD control children
(Travis et al., 2001). While potentially more sensitive to actual helping behaviour, direct
observation suffers from the difﬁculty of being only a limited sampling at one point in time
in one setting whereas teachers and parents have a wider range of exposure to prosocial
acts in many contexts.

Our ﬁnding that EU bore no signiﬁcant relationship to mutual friendship at either Time
1 or Time 2 was unexpected. However, it is consistent with previous ﬁndings (a) that ToM
and EU are separate, non-overlapping dimensions of social cognition (Cutting & Dunn,
1999; Dunn, 1995) and (b) that preschool ToM predicts different school-aged outcomes
from those predicted by EU (Dunn, 1995). Our ﬁndings add to this picture by
demonstrating that an understanding of other minds is more central than emotion
awareness to the forging and maintaining of mutual friendships. Of course, such a
conclusion must remain tentative pending replication across different age groups and
using a wider range of ToM and EU tasks than we did. Indeed, all of our ﬁndings warrant
replication given the inevitable limitations of any single study of the complex patterns of
associations that exist over time between children’s social thinking and their social
behaviour in both the intimate context of reciprocal friendship and the larger arena of
social popularity status in the peer group. It now remains to future studies to examine
early mutual friendship status as a predictor of later social–cognitive outcomes, given the
likely bidirectionality of links between the two. Conceivably, these may be complicated,
as in Banerjee et al.’s (2011) group popularity study, by cyclic alternation. They found
ToM as a predictor of group rejection at one age was followed by the reverse at a later age.
Nevertheless, pending such further study, our discovery of a longitudinal link between
ToM understanding and chronic friendlessness remains an important one for both theory
and for clinical practice. In theory, the link is, indeed, plausibly bidirectional. Via trust,
insight, intimate conversation, and the mutual afﬁrmation that experiencing a reciprocal
friendship is apt to build (e.g., Dunn, Cutting, & Fisher, 2002), children might gain greater
ToM-based understanding of their friends’ minds. This could then generalize to
heightened ToM-based understanding of people at large. At the same time, children
who enter formal schooling with an already well-developed grasp of FB and other ToM
concepts might use this conceptual knowledge to forge and maintain mutual friendships
among their classroom peers. Early ToM understanding might likewise be important for
sustaining friendship through the conﬂicts and upheavals of the important social
transition from family to peer focus between ages 5 and 7 (Hughes & Dunn, 2002).

Clinically, assuming it is replicated, the link we discovered between low ToM
understanding at age 5 with chronic friendlessness 2 years later at age 7 could prove
useful both diagnostically and therapeutically. As past research shows (e.g., Bagwell et al.,
1998), children who are chronically friendless in middle and later childhood are at
heightened risk of adverse emotional, academic, and psychiatric outcomes not only
during childhood but through the remainder of life. The earliest roots of chronic
friendlessness appear from our data to include poor ToM understanding of FB. Given that
FB tests are quick and easy to administer and highly reliable (Peterson, Wellman, & Liu,

Friendlessness and ToM 15

2005; Wellman et al., 2001), they might prove a useful addition to the assessment
repertoires of therapists and school counsellors concerned with early intervention to
prevent chronic friendlessness, although of course not constituting an adequate
substitute for a comprehensive diagnostic work-up. At the same time, an impressive
body of ToM training research (e.g., Lohmann & Tomasello, 2003) shows that typically
developing preschoolers’ understanding of minds can be enhanced by brief, targeted
interventions. This could provide a supplementary tool, along with playgroups and
social-skill-building exercises (e.g., Rubin et al., 2006), for early intervention on behalf of
friendless young children during the early years of school when mutual friendships, if built
and maintained, become ‘ key predictors of later enjoyment and adjustment to school’
(Dunn et al., 2002, p. 621).
