 Structural Components and Intellectual
 Correlates of Cognitive Perspective Taking in
 First- through Fourth-Grade Children

 KURDEK, LAWRENCE A. Structural Components and Intellectual Correlates of Cognitive Per-
 spective Taking in First- through Fourth-Grade Children. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1977, 48,
 1503-1511. Cognitive perspective taking, the ability to infer another person's cognitions, was as-
 sessed in 96 first- through fourth-grade children by 4 of the most widely used cognitive per-
 spective-taking tasks: Feffer's RTT, Selman's social-moral dilemmas, Chandler's bystander car-
 toons, and a variation of Flavell et al.'s nickel-dime game. Task performance significantly
 increased with increasing grade level, and sex differences were nonsignificant. Results from both
 a consideration of task difficulty and a principal components analysis indicated that the 4 tasks
 were best viewed as 2 pairs of tasks: (a) RTT and dilemma, and (b) cartoon and nickel-dime
 variation; it is argued that only in the latter task pair can one be fairly certain that the child is
 coordinating his own and another person's perspective in the process of inferring another per-
 son's psychological status.

 Progress in charting the nature of the

 development of children's ability to take an-
 other person's point of view has been impeded
 by several conceptual difficulties. First, there
 is evidence that perspective taking cannot be
 viewed as a unitary ability; several studies
 have reported nonsignificant correlations among
 children's scores in tasks of perceptual, cog-
 nitive, and affective perspective taking (e.g.,
 Kurdek & Rodgon 1975; Rubin, Note 1). Given
 this evidence for considering perspective taking
 as a multidimensional social-cognitive ability,
 one can justifiably turn a skeptical eye to the
 generality of children's performance on tasks
 within a particular content area of perspective
 taking. The focus of the present investigation
 was on cognitive perspective taking, the child's
 ability to infer the thoughts, attitudes, inten-
 tions, etc. of another person.

 reliable tasks; consequently, available reliability
 data (interrater agreement), internal consis-
 tency (correlation between subscores), and
 test-retest -reliability were examined for four
 of the most widely used cognitive-perspective-
 taking tasks (see Method below for task de-
 scriptions):

 1. Feffer's Role Taking Task (RTT)

 (Feffer & Gourevitch 1960): Interrater reli-
 abilities for RTT protocols have been high,
 Pearson r's ranging from .84 (Wolfe 1963)
 to .97 (Turnure 1975). Correlations between
 RTT subscores, however, have been only mod-
 erate, ranging from .27 (Keller 1976) to values
 in the .40's (Feffer & Gourevitch 1960; Tur-
 nure 1975; Wolfe 1963). No test-retest re-
 liability data are available.

 The first purpose of this investigation

 was to assess the consistency of children's per-
 formance on a variety of cognitive-perspective-
 taking tasks. The major problem in construct-
 ing the task battery, of course, was choosing

 2. Selman's social-moral dilemmas (Sel-
 man & Byrne 1974): Reports of interrater
 agreement range from Pearson r's of .78 to .96
 (Selman & Byrne 1974; Selman & Lieberman
 1975), and a 5-week test-retest correlation
 of .62 has been reported (Selman & Lieber-

 man 1975). Correlations between cogni-
 tive-perspective-taking scores on various di-
 lemmas have not been reported, although moral
 judgment and interpersonal conception scores
 among dilemmas have been moderately re-
 lated, Pearson r's ranging from .61 to .85 (Sel-
 man 1976; Selman & Lieberman 1975).

 3. Chandler's bystander cartoons (Chan-
 dler 1973b): The most complete and adequate
 set of reliability data are available for this
 task; interrater reliabilities range from .78 to
 .95 (Pich6, Michlin, Rubin, & Johnson 1975;
 Burka & Glenwick, Note 2), correlations among
 cartoon scores range from .38 to .87 (Chan-
 dler, Note 3; Gash & Smock, Note 4), and
 a 2-week parallel form test-retest r of .83 has
 been reported (Burka & Glenwick, Note 2).
 4. Flavell, Botkin, Fry, Wright, and Jar-
 vis's nickel-dime game (Flavell et al. 1968):
 Reliability data for this task are limited to
 reports of interrater reliability, which for the
 hiding subtask range from .72 to 1.00 (Emler
 & Rushton 1974; Flavell et al. 1968); inter-
 rater reliability for the guessing subtask has
 been reported to be .97 (Kuhn, Note 5).

 As can be seen, reliability data for the
 above tasks are not extensive, although what
 data are available indicate that these tasks can
 be considered to be reliable indices of chil-
 dren's cognitive-perspective-taking ability. An-
 cillary to the first purpose of this study of
 assessing consistency in children's cognitive-
 perspective-taking task performance was ob-
 taining interrater, internal consistency, and
 test-retest reliabilities for the above set of
 cognitive-perspective-taking tasks.

 A second conceptual problem recurring
 throughout the perspective-taking literature is
 the nature of the relationship between this
 social-cognitive skill and intelligence. Gener-
 ally, perspective taking has been viewed as
 developing within the context of a network
 of emerging cognitive skills, but most investi-
 gators of the perspective-taking-intelligence
 relationship have considered this latter vari-
 able as either an omnibus IQ score or a com-
 posite score based on performance on several
 Piagetian tasks (see Shantz 1975). The major
 difficulty in interpreting the obtained relation-
 ships is that intelligence as assessed by either
 IQ tests or Piagetian tasks is itself a multi-
 dimensional ability (e.g., Berzonsky 1971;
 Guilford 1967), and consequently one cannot
 be certain to what particular aspect of intel-

 ligence perspective taking has been found to
 relate. The second purpose of this study was
 to assess the relationship between cognitive
 perspective taking, the ability to coordinate
 simultaneously conceptual viewpoints, and one
 dimension of intelligence, the ability to syn-
 thesize simultaneously separate elements of
 a stimulus field into a system of relationships.
 Das, Kirby, and Jarman (1975) have provided
 evidence for the existence of this mode of cog-
 nitive functioning which has been assessed by
 both Ravens Progressive Matrices and an audi-
 tory-visual cross-modal coding task.

 The present investigation was limited to
 an assessment of the convergent validation of
 cognitive perspective taking in a group of first
 through fourth graders that encompassed the
 age range that has been included in studies of
 cognitive perspective taking as assessed by
 each of the four tasks of interest. Increased
 accuracy of performance with age has been
 reported for Feffer's RTT (Chandler 1973a;
 Feffer & Gourevitch 1960; Turnure 1975;
 Wolfe 1963); Selman's social-moral dilemmas
 (Selman & Byrne 1974); Chandler's bystander
 cartoons (Chandler & Greenspan 1972); and
 Flavell et al.'s nickel-dime game (Flavell et al.
 1968). Equally consistent have been reports
 of nonsignificant sex differences in children's
 performance on each of these tasks (Chandler
 1973a; Chandler & Greenspan 1972; Emler &
 Rushton 1974; Selman & Byrne 1974).

 There is little evidence regarding the de-
 gree of relationship among the four cognitive
 perspective-taking tasks of concern. Task in-
 terrelationships were therefore examined in
 terms of (a) the level of task difficulty and
 (b) the nature and degree of task intercorre-
 lations. In addition, a principal-components
 analysis of the matrix of correlations among
 the cognitive-perspective-taking and simulta-
 neous-cognitive-functioning scores was per-
 formed to provide evidence on both the nature
 and dimensionality of cognitive perspective
 taking.

 Method

 Subjects

 Subjects were 24 middle-class children
 from each of grades 1-4; mean ages were 6.52,
 7.65, 8.66, and 9.80 years, respectively. Five
 of these children were black. In no instance
 did the age range of children from adjacent
 grades overlap, and males and females were

 equally represented in all but the first grade,
 in which 10 males and 14 females participated.
 Since counterbalancing the presentation
 order of the four cognitive-perspective-taking
 and two simultaneous-cognitive-functioning
 tasks was impractical, the former set of tasks
 was administered before the latter; within each
 task set, however, presentation order was fully
 counterbalanced. In each grade, one child
 was randomly assigned to one of 24 possible
 task presentation orders; all tasks were ad-
 ministered within a single 1-hour session.

 For the calculation of test-retest reliability
 for the cognitive perspective-taking tasks, 12
 children from each grade, six males and six
 females, were randomly chosen and were re-
 tested on the tasks 5 weeks after the time of
 their original administration.

 Measures of Cognitive Perspective Taking

 Feffer's Role Taking Task (RTT).-Each
 child was shown two three-character pictures
 that controlled for the sex of the child; one
 scene (Hit Story) depicted a woman hitting
 a child while an opposite-sex child looked on,
 while the other (Liquid Story) depicted a
 woman pouring a liquid into a child's glass
 while an opposite-sex child looked on.1 For
 each picture, the child was first asked to tell
 a story based on the picture and was then
 asked to recount the scene's activity from the
 point of view of each of the three characters.
 These successive refocusings were evaluated
 on a 20-point scale devised by Schnall and
 Feffer (Note 6) which reflects the degree to
 which the child generates refocusings with
 appropriate inner and outer orientations. For
 each RTT story, a measure of the child's aver-
 age level of cognitive perspective taking was
 derived by summing the scores achieved for
 each of the three perspective-taking attempts;
 a total RTT score was derived by adding the
 scores for both stories.

 Selman's social-moral dilemmas (Dilem-
 ma).-Each child was presented two dilemmas
 in the form of audiovisual filmstrips.2 The first
 dilemma involved a moral problem for Holly,
 who had to decide if she should climb a tree
 to save Sean's kitten in spite of a promise to
 her father not to climb trees anymore. The
 second dilemma involved a more neutral social

 Lawrence A. Kurdek 1505

 dilemma for Tom, who had to decide if he
 should buy Mike a puppy for his birthday;
 Mike recently lost his dog and swears he never
 wants to see another dog again.

 Following the presentation of the dilem-

 ma, the child was questioned about the con-
 tent of the dilemma in order to ensure accu-
 rate comprehension; no memory difficulties
 were encountered. Six standardized questions
 were then presented as a means of assessing
 the child's level of cognitive perspective taking;
 these questions focused on the nature of cog-
 nitive perspective taking at levels one through
 three of Selman and Byrne's (1974) structural-
 developmental model of cognitive perspective
 taking, although responses to each question
 could reveal thinking at any level.

 Based on Selman and Byrne's (Note 7)

 manual for scoring children's level of moral
 reasoning, the author devised a seven-point
 scoring system for directly assessing the child's
 level of cognitive perspective taking. For each
 dilemma, each response to each of six ques-
 tions was assigned a score that reflected the
 degree to which the child realized that two
 persons could consider each other's viewpoint
 simultaneously and mutually. A score for each
 dilemma was derived by summing the scores
 for each question and a total dilemma score
 was derived by summing the moral (Holly)
 and social (Tom) dilemma scores.

 Chandler's bystander cartoons (Cartoon).

 -Each child was successively shown three
 cartoon sequences (Sandcastle, Postman, and
 Bakery); in each of these eight-frame stories,
 a bystander is introduced midway into the
 sequence and observes the main character act-
 ing in a manner that is causally related to an
 event that occurred prior to the bystander's
 arrival. The child was first asked to tell a story
 about the entire sequence; direct inquiry was
 made into the child's perception of both the
 main character's affective reaction to the cir-
 cumstances of the antecedent event and the
 relationship between this event and the char-
 acter's subsequent behavior. After the initial
 description was completed, the child was asked
 to retell the cartoon sequence from the by-
 stander's point of view beginning with the
 point in the sequence in which the bystander

 was first introduced. Once the child attributed
 to the bystander knowledge of the main char-
 acter's feelings in the final frame, direct inquiry
 was made into the reason why the bystander
 thought the main character felt the way he did.
 Each of the three sequences was assigned one
 of five scores that reflected the degree to which
 the child was able to keep his knowledge of
 the antecedent event from influencing the by-
 stander's account of the factors responsible for
 the main character's behavior.3 A total cartoon
 score was derived by adding together the
 scores for each sequence.

 Flavell et al.'s nickel-dime game (Hide/
 Guess).-Kuhn's (Note 5) revision of Flavell
 et al.'s (1968) original task was used since
 in the revised procedure the child successively
 takes the role of either the hider or guesser
 in a two-person game in which money is to
 be hidden in one of two boxes. In the hiding
 game, the child was shown two plastic boxes,
 one with one nickel and the other with two
 nickels taped on top. It was demonstrated that
 inside the boxes was the same amount of
 money as was indicated on top of the box.
 The child was told that a boy/ girl was going
 to come into the room later that day and would
 be given a chance to guess which box had the
 money inside. The child was further told that
 the boy/girl knew that he/she was going to be
 tricked and was then instructed to try and
 trick the boy/girl by removing the money from
 one of the boxes. The child was questioned
 about the reason for his/her choice.

 In the guessing game, the child was shown
 a pair of boxes similar to that used in the
 hiding game. The correspondence between the
 money taped on top of the box and the money
 inside the box was demonstrated with the
 hiding game boxes, after which the child was
 told that a boy/ girl had earlier taken the money
 out of one of the guessing boxes. The child
 was told that he could guess which box had
 the money inside and was asked to explain his
 choice.

 For each task, the child's reason was as-
 signed one of five scores that indicated the
 degree to which the child understood the re-
 cursive nature of thought in this game setting

 (e.g., thinking about the other person's think-
 ing about one's own thoughts about the other
 person's game strategies). A combined Hide/
 Guess score was derived by summing the scores
 for the hide-and-guess games.

 Measures of Simultaneous
 Cognitive Functioning

 Ravens Progressive Matrices (Ravens).-
 Sets A, Ab, and B of Ravens Coloured Pro-
 gressive Matrices were administered and scored
 in accordance with the test manual (Ravens
 1965). The maximum score for each set was
 12, giving a total maximum score of 36.

 Cross-modal coding (Coding).-The cross-
 modal coding task was devised by Birch and
 Belmont (1964) and required the child to
 listen to auditory tap patterns made by a pen-
 cil against the edge of a desk after which the
 child was asked to recognize visually which
 one of three dot patterns represented the audi-
 tory stimulus pattern. There were 10 test pat-
 terns, giving a total possible score of 10.

 Results

 Reliability of Cognitive-Perspective-
 Taking Tasks

 The percentages of perfect agreement be-
 tween two raters' independent scoring of all
 children's responses to the RTT, Dilemma,
 Cartoon, and Hide/Guess tasks were 95, 99,
 92, and 96, respectively. The Pearson product-
 moment correlation coefficients between all
 children's scores on the two RTT stories, two
 dilemmas, three cartoons, and hide-and-guess
 tasks were .40, .62, .56 to .68, and .69, re-
 spectively (all p's < .001). The moderate cor-
 relations between subscores for the Dilemma,
 Cartoon, and Hide/Guess tasks justified the
 use of combined total scores for these tasks.
 Although the correlation between the two RTT
 stories was rather low, the relationships ob-
 tained between each story and the other three
 cognitive-perspective-taking tasks and the two
 simultaneous-cognitive-functioning tasks were
 generally similar; it was therefore decided to
 use the combined total RTT score as well.4
 Finally, the 5-week test-retest Pearson r's for
 48 children's total RTT, Dilemma, Cartoon,

 3 Chandler's (Note 8) usual scoring procedure weights egocentric responses more heavily
 than perspectivistic ones; this procedure was reversed here to conform to the scoring procedures
 of the other tasks.

 4 It should be noted that for each of the cognitive-perspective-taking tasks no practice ef-
 fects were evident; i.e., task scores did not increase significantly upon repeated presentation of
 task items.

 Grade and Sex Differences in Cognitive-
 Perspective-Taking Task Performance

 The means and standard deviations for

 each of the cognitive-perspective-taking tasks
 are presented by children's grade level in
 table 1. To examine the effects of grade and
 sex variations, a multivariate analysis of vari-
 ance was performed. A multivariate test for
 linear, quadratic, and cubic grade trends re-
 vealed only a significant linear effect, F (4,89)
 = 21.38, p < .0001; both the multivariate sex
 main effect and the grade x sex interaction
 were nonsignificant. In order to specify the lo-
 cation of specific mean grade differences, 95%
 simultaneous confidence intervals were con-
 structed for each possible pair of grade com-
 parisons on each of the four tasks. Significant
 pairwise grade differences occurred more fre-
 quently on both the Dilemma (1 vs. 4, 2 vs. 4,
 1 vs. 3, and 2 vs. 3) and Cartoon (1 vs. 4 and
 2 vs. 4) tasks than on either the RTT or Hide/
 Guess tasks (both 1 vs. 4).

 Interrelationships among Cognitive-Perspective-
 Taking and Simultaneous-Cognitive-
 Functioning Task Scores

 Three approaches were taken to assess
 the nature of the interrelationships among the
 four cognitive perspective taking tasks: (a)
 the calculation of task difficulty, (b) the com-
 putation of Pearson product-moment correla-
 tion coefficients between task pairs, and (c)
 a principal components analysis of the matrix
 of correlations among the tasks of both cogni-
 tive perspective taking and simultaneous cog-
 nitive functioning.

 Task difficulty.-Task difficulty was as-

 TABLE 1

 For each of the following tasks, children
 scoring at or above the given score were con-
 sidered to have passed the task: (a) RTT: 14
 points: the child received an average score of
 7 on each story, indicating that he could dif-
 ferentiate between a character's inner and
 outer state; (b) Dilemma: 6 points: the child
 received an average score of 3 on each dilem-
 ma, indicating that he realized that one could
 cognize about another person's cognitions; (c)
 Cartoon: 12 points: the child received a score
 of 4 on each sequence, indicating that he was
 aware that the bystander's understanding of
 the main character's behavior differed from his
 own; and (d) Hide/Guess: 6 points: the child
 received an average score of 3 on each game,
 indicating that he was aware of his opponent's
 strategy-constructing activity.

 The percentage of children passing each
 task for the total sample and at each grade
 level is presented in table 2. The order of task
 difficulty was perfectly consistent for both the
 total sample and at each grade level; from
 easiest to most difficult, respectively, they
 were: Dilemma, RTT, Cartoon, and Hide/
 Guess. As can be seen from table 2, the latter
 pair of tasks was more difficult than the former
 pair. Further evidence for this task dichotomy
 is provided by the finding that 54 children
 passed the Dilemma/RTT task pair while fail-
 ing the Cartoon/Hide/Guess task pair, whereas
 no child failed the former task pair while pass-

 sessed by determining the number of children
 passing and failing each cognitive-perspective-
 taking task, with passing being defined as the
 child's demonstrating the ability to infer the
 cognitions of another person. Since the child's
 optimal level of task performance was of con-
 cern here, the highest score attained rather
 than the average score was considered for both
 the RTT and Dilemma tasks.

 ing the latter task pair; in short, passing the
 Dilemma/RTT task pair appears to have been
 prerequisite to passing the Cartoon/Hide/
 Guess task pair.

 Task intercorrelations.-The matrix of cor-
 relations based on age and the cognitive-per-
 spective-taking and simultaneous-cognitive-
 functioning tasks for the total sample is pre-
 sented in table 3; the cognitive-perspective-
 taking task scores were significantly interre-
 lated although only 5.4%-23.5% of task vari-
 ability was accounted for. Moreover, when the
 effects of both age and simultaneous cognitive
 functioning were partialed out, the number of
 significant correlations was reduced (see table
 3).

 Principal components analysis.-The re-
 sults of the principal components analysis with
 Varimax rotation of the matrix of correlations
 among the four cognitive-perspective-taking
 and two simultaneous-cognitive-functioning
 tasks for the total sample are presented in
 table 4. Even with the effects of age partialed
 out, two factors were extracted; the weights
 assigned by the rotation suggest the following
 task dichotomy: (a) Cartoon, Hide/Guess,
 Ravens, and Coding, and (b) RTT and Di-
 lemma. It should be noted, however, that the
 Hide/Guess task had similar moderate loadings
 on both factors.

 Discussion

 performance on these tasks is generally con-
 sistent over a 5-week period. The evidence
 relevant to the internal consistency of children's
 performance on items of the same task, how-
 ever, is problematic and raises the issue of
 task-specific factors in cognitive perspective
 taking. Although the pattern of correlations
 for task subscores was consistent enough to
 warrant the use of total scores for purposes
 of the present investigation, the magnitude of
 the correlations between/among task subscores
 was not very high. Why should a child evi-
 dence different levels of cognitive perspective
 taking in various forms of the same task?

 Clearly, consideration of the content with
 which the child is dealing is needed. It may
 be that the child's familiarity with the content
 area of a certain task item would facilitate the
 utilization of cognitive-perspective-taking skills
 (Keller 1976); having been in the same situa-
 tion, for example, may facilitate the child's
 identifying another person's viewpoint. Of all
 the tasks considered, the RTT evidenced the
 worst internal consistency; given the projective
 nature of this task, the type of affective con-
 tent involved may have facilitated the use of
 cognitive-perspective-taking skills in some chil-
 dren but hindered it in others. Given the in-
 creasing interest in both the nature and corre-
 lates of cognitive perspective taking, careful
 attention needs to be given to the psychomet-
 ric soundness of available tasks (see Rubin,
 Note 1).

 child need not separate his view of the social
 interaction from that of the other person. Nei-
 ther the filmstrip character's view of the di-
 lemma nor the illustrated character's view of
 the RTT story scene were engineered to be
 deliberately different from the child's own
 viewpoint, and the child could therefore pre-
 dict another person's viewpoint in these tasks
 armed only with his own social perceptions.
 Thus, for both the Dilemma and RTT tasks
 one cannot be certain of the processes in which
 the child engages to infer another person's
 cognitions, since the child could merely be
 attributing his own social cognitions about the
 social interaction to the other person; in effect,
 this would involve identifying only one per-
 spective, rather than simultaneously coordi-
 nating and balancing two differing viewpoints
 (Chandler & Greenspan 1972).

 Such is not the case for the Cartoon and

 icant sex differences in task performance are
 concordant with previous findings (e.g., Chan-
 dler & Greenspan 1972; Flavell et al. 1968;
 Selman & Byrne 1974; Turnure 1975). The
 present data, however, provide no clue as to
 what specific age-related factors or processes
 explain the increase in task performance with
 increasing grade level; given the wealth of
 descriptive data in this particular area of so-
 cial-cognitive research, the next step in the
 overall research paradigm should focus on the
 identification of explanatory factors. The find-
 ing of nonsignificant sex differences both con-
 trasts with reports of significant sex differences
 in the perceptual and affective content areas
 of perspective taking and provides further evi-
 dence for independently studying the develop-
 ment of children's cognitive, perceptual, and
 affective perspective-taking skills (Kurdek &
 Rodgon 1975).

 Hide/Guess tasks, however, which require that
 the child both be cognizant of his own and
 another person's differing viewpoint and, more
 important, be able to coordinate simultane-
 ously these viewpoints. Passing the Cartoon
 task necessitated that the child simultaneously
 consider his own and the bystander's qualita-
 tively different notions of the reasons under-
 lying the main character's behavior, and suc-
 cessful performance on the Hide/Guess task
 required that the child recognize that hider
 and guesser strategies were related but antag-
 onistic: the hider was out to "get" the guesser,
 not to help him win the money.

 Additional support for viewing the Car-

 Interrelationships among Cognitive-Perspective-
 Taking and Simultaneous-Cognitive-
 Functioning Scores

 The major findings of this study deal with
 the nature of the relationships among the cog-
 nitive-perspective-taking task scores. The low
 to moderate task intercorrelations provide little
 support for conceptualizing cognitive perspec-
 tive taking as a unidimensional social-cognitive
 ability. Furthermore, both the pattern of task
 difficulty and the results of the principal com-
 ponents analysis indicate that the four tasks
 could best be considered as two pairs of tasks:
 (a) Dilemma and RTT and (b) Cartoon and
 Hide/ Guess.

 toon and Hide/Guess tasks as involving a si-
 multaneous coordination of perspectives is pro-
 vided by the finding that these two tasks and
 the two tasks of simultaneous cognitive func-
 tioning loaded highly on the same factor. Das
 et al. (1975) have provided evidence that the
 two tasks of simultaneous cognitive function-
 ing indicate how well the child can partition
 cognitive items into groups and then synthe-
 size these items into a more comprehensive
 system of relationships. More specifically, the
 Ravens test of analogical reasoning assesses
 the child's ability to analyze a whole into its
 perceived elements and then compare and
 coordinate analogous changes in these elements
 (Ravens 1965), while the Coding task requires
 that the child first construct a relationship
 among auditorily presented elements and then
 recognize this relationship in spatial groupings
 of visually presented elements.

 What structural characteristics distinguish

 between these two pairs of tasks? To perform
 well on both the Dilemma and RTT tasks, the

 1510 Child Development

 The parallel between the structural pro-
 cesses involved in the two tasks of simultaneous
 cognitive functioning and those delineated
 above with regard to the Cartoon and Hide/
 Guess task pair is striking; for these two cog-
 nitive perspective taking tasks it is suggested
 that the child must construct his own view-
 point, infer the other person's differing view-
 point, and then simultaneously coordinate the
 two. Both sets of tasks seem to involve a par-
 ticularly flexible cognitive ability in which cog-
 nitive items are juxtaposed and coordinated
 without a concomitant loss of each item's iden-
 tity. This finding supports the view of those
 who have suggested that physical and social
 cognition should be structurally related (e.g.,
 Selman 1976) but, more important, also indi-
 cates that this relationship must be examined
 in terms of specific cognitive processes rather
 than in terms of global "general intelligence"
 factors.

 What do the present results indicate about
 the child qua social cognizer? The response,
 of course, depends on which pair of tasks is
 being considered. As indicated by the number
 of children passing both the Dilemma and RTT
 tasks at each grade level, even first and second
 graders can infer another person's psycholog-
 ical state; this social inferential skill, however,
 seems confined to situations in which view-
 points need not be coordinated (see Urberg &
 Docherty 1976). This does not mean that the
 young child is an incompetent social cognizer
 since many real-life situations occur in which
 the assumption of self-other similarity is prob-
 ably accurate (Hoffman 1976; Shantz 1975).
 But equally realistic are situations in which
 one's perspective clashes with that of another
 person, and it is these situations that pose
 problems for the young child. The older child,
 here the fourth grader, seems to be beginning
 to understand not only that people think and
 feel differently from one another but also that
 differing viewpoints of an identical social situ-
 ation can be coordinated without one's obliter-
 ating the other. Much work needs to be done
 in teasing out the factors that account for this
 realization.
