ABSTRACT
Research Findings: In this study, we investigated associations among social
cognition skills (specifically, emotion knowledge and theory of mind), lan-
guage abilities, and 3 varieties of prosocial behavior (helping, sharing, and
comforting) in early childhood. The effects of age and gender were also
taken into account. Participants were 149 Italian children between 24 and
47 months of age (M = 35.6 months, SD = 6.77 months). We adopted a
multitrait mixed-methods research design, using direct measures of
emotion knowledge, theory of mind, and language as well as naturalistic
observations of children’s free play with peers to detect the frequency with
which they engaged in prosocial behaviors. Ordinal
logistic regression
analyses showed that helping behaviors were especially accounted for by
emotion knowledge and gender, whereas variance in sharing behaviors was
mostly explained by theory-of-mind ability and language. Practice or Policy:
The findings encourage those involved in early childhood education to
develop training and intervention programs to enhance children’s emo-
tional, linguistic, and cognitive skills. Given that these results were obtained
with children as young as 2 and 3 years, preventive intervention should be
implemented during the earliest years of life.

In developmental psychology, the early years of life are viewed as a crucial period for the achievement
of social-emotional, cognitive, and linguistic milestones. Beginning in toddlerhood, children go
through many changes: For example, they make significant advances in social cognition, a theoretical
construct that includes the ability to infer the internal states—such as the intentions, goals, emotions,
desires, beliefs, and thoughts—of other people (Carpendale & Lewis, 2006; Ornaghi, Brockmeier, &
Grazzani, 2014). Two well-known social cognition competencies are emotion knowledge and theory of
mind. The former involves the ability to recognize and understand emotions in oneself and others; the
latter entails the understanding that people’s actions are guided by inner states such as intentions,
desires, and beliefs (Astington, Harris, & Olson, 1988). Even at the emergent stage, social cognition
skills are related to language abilities (Grazzani, Ornaghi, Agliati, & Brazzelli, 2016; Imuta, Henry,
Slaughter, Selcuk, & Ruffman, 2016; Rieffe & Wiefferink, 2017).

A growing body of research has shown that language may provide young children with significant
insight into other people’s emotions and thoughts (de Rosnay, Pons, Harris, & Morrell, 2004; Milligan,
Astington, & Dack, 2007; Rhee et al., 2013; Strand, Downs, & Barbosa-Leiker, 2016), with key implications
for the acquisition of social and emotional competencies. Specifically, children deploy their current social
cognition skills and language abilities to win acceptance from peers and engage in social interaction
(Menting, van Lier, & Koot, 2011; Slaughter, Imuta, Peterson, & Henry, 2015). As a result, their compre-
hension of people’s inner states is enhanced still further, and they make increased attempts to enact positive
social behaviors (Denham et al., 2012; Ensor & Hughes, 2005). In terms of positive social conduct, the

literature has focused on prosocial behaviors, defined as voluntary actions intended to benefit another,
showing their associations with psychological well-being, social adjustment, and school achievement
(Eisenberg, Eggum-Wilkens, & Spinrad, 2015).

Toddlers begin early on to engage in a variety of prosocial behaviors such as helping, sharing, and
comforting (Dunfield, Kuhlmeier, O’Connell, & Kelley, 2011; Svetlova, Nichols, & Brownell, 2010),
which are remarkably complex because they require children to interpret when their intervention is
relevant and how to act appropriately. Thus, from the very first years of life, both the ability to
recognize and understand others’
inner states and suitable levels of language may be crucial
prerequisites to acting on behalf of others.

However, there is a relative lack of research on the relationships among social cognition,
language, and prosociality during early childhood. In fact,
little is known about how emotion
knowledge and theory of mind generally relate to prosocial behavior in the early years.
Furthermore, few studies have examined the links between language and prosocial behavior in
early childhood, as observed by Imuta et al. (2016). In addition, prosocial behaviors have mainly
been observed in experimental laboratory settings (Dunfield & Kuhlmeier, 2013; Dunfield et al.,
2011; Ensor & Hughes, 2005; Rhee et al., 2013; Wu & Su, 2014) rather than in naturalistic contexts
(Cassidy, Werner, Rourke, Zubernis, & Balaraman, 2003; Denham, 1986). Hence, in the current
study, we adopted a multitrait mixed-methods approach to investigate whether emotion knowledge,
theory of mind, and language are related to the occurrence of prosocial behaviors in 2- and 3-year-
olds.

Emotion knowledge and theory of mind

Toddlers learn early on to recognize and label emotion expressions, and as time goes on they also come
to understand that different situations elicit a range of emotions in oneself and others (Bassett,
Denham, Mincic, & Graling, 2012). Hence, two distinct components of emotion knowledge gradually
emerge: the ability to recognize emotion expressions (emotion recognition) and familiarity with typical
and atypical situational elicitors of emotion (emotion situation knowledge).

Alongside their growing emotion knowledge, young children also develop a progressive understanding
of the mental states of other people. The classical view of theory-of-mind development suggests that true
comprehension of others’ internal states is attained at around 4 years, given that most children system-
atically fail false-belief tasks before this age (Wellman & Liu, 2004). However, children already hold some
knowledge of others’ minds before the false-belief test milestone. In fact, an understanding of desires
develops at around 2 years of age as a toddler judges that two persons (the child and someone else) may have
different desires about the same object. Then, at approximately 3 years, children understand that others can
hold true beliefs, which are coherent with reality. Later, children judge that two persons may have different
beliefs about the same object when they do not know which belief is true or false (Wellman, 2014).

The literature shows that toddlers and preschoolers who are more competent in understanding
emotions generally tend to be more accurate in attributing mental states to others. For example, a
pioneering study conducted by Denham (1986) with 2- and 3-year-olds identified significant positive
correlations between children’s emotion knowledge and their cognitive perspective-taking skills.
Similarly, Harwood and Farrar (2006) found that preschoolers’ affective perspective taking was signifi-
cantly correlated with their theory-of-mind performance, evaluated by the unexpected identity task and
the unexpected location task, independent of age and language ability. Evidence of significant correlations
was also reported by de Rosnay and colleagues (2004). These authors found that the association between
false-belief understanding and emotion attribution ability in 3- to 6-year-old children remained strong
after age was controlled for but lost significance when verbal abilities were taken into account.

Language abilities and links with social cognition skills

Research with toddlers and preschoolers has shown that language abilities are key correlates of both emotion
knowledge and theory of mind. In fact, Cassidy et al. (2003) assessed language, mental state understanding,
and emotion knowledge in children ages 37 to 65 months, reporting positive and significant correlations
between language abilities and both theory-of-mind skills and emotion understanding, even when the
effects of age were taken into account. Similarly, de Rosnay et al. (2004) administered measures of verbal
ability and belief-based emotion tasks to children in the same age range, finding language abilities to be
correlated with both false-belief understanding and emotion attribution independent of age.

Significant correlations between emotion knowledge and language were also identified by Strand
et al. (2016) in a study on emotion recognition, affective perspective taking, and language in children
ages 36 to 67 months. Again, there was a strong relationship between emotion knowledge and language
abilities that remained even when the effects of age were accounted for. A further valuable contribution
to this line of inquiry has been provided by training studies, in which participation in conversational
activities enhanced children’s ability to express, recognize, understand, and reflect on emotional
experience (Grazzani, Ornaghi, Agliati, et al., 2016; Grazzani, Ornaghi, & Brockmeier, 2016).

With regard to the relationship between language and theory of mind, Ruffman, Slade, Devitt,
and Crowe (2006) administered theory-of-mind and language tasks to children at age 3 years
and again 1 year later, finding significant positive correlations between these measures. More
recently, a meta-analysis by Imuta et al. (2016) confirmed the existence of a significant associa-
tion between language abilities and theory of mind in children between 2 and 12 years of age.
This was in line with the conclusions of an earlier meta-analysis by Milligan and colleagues
(2007), which also posited strong links between language abilities and false-belief understanding
in children younger than 7 years. It is interesting that Milligan et al. attempted to clarify the
causality of these relationships and found bidirectional influences, although language appeared to
have a greater effect on false-belief understanding than vice versa. Similarly, Meins, Fernyhough,
Arnott, Leekam, and de Rosnay (2013) monitored the development of children over a 2-year
period from 26 to 51 months of age, finding that early language abilities predicted later theory-
of-mind performance.

Prosocial behaviors: Helping, sharing, and comforting

The understanding that others have emotions and thoughts, along with the ability to explicitly infer
these mental states and comprehend linguistic cues, affects the development of positive peer
relationships and the emergence of prosocial behaviors (Denham et al., 2012; Rhee et al., 2013),
defined as voluntary actions intended to benefit others (Eisenberg et al., 2015). Scholars have
proposed conceptualizing prosocial behavior as a multidimensional construct that encompasses
helping, sharing, and comforting. Helping behaviors are defined as actions intended to fulfill an
instrumental need (Dunfield et al., 2011) and can also take the form of providing valuable informa-
tion to someone who needs it (Liszkowski, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2008). Sharing behaviors involve
the voluntary giving away of a valued resource to another individual who both lacks and desires or
needs it (Brownell, Iesue, Nichols, & Svetlova, 2013). Comforting behaviors are actions intended to
alleviate the negative emotional or physical state of another person (Zahn-Waxler & Radke-Yarrow,
1990).

Each of these types of prosocial behaviors requires specific cognitive processes enabling the
child, respectively, to perceive a given problem, represent its cause and solutions, and feel
motivated to act accordingly to alleviate another person’s distress (Dunfield, 2014). Given that
these behaviors are prompted by the recognition of another person’s state of need—whether an
instrumental need, a material desire, or emotional distress (Dunfield & Kuhlmeier, 2013)—it is
plausible that the ability to identify and understand such inner states may play a key role in
prosocial conduct.

E. CONTE ET AL.

Social cognition and prosocial behavior

A body of research suggests that the frequency of prosocial behaviors is affected by emotion knowledge
during the preschool (Denham et al., 2012; Ornaghi, Pepe, & Grazzani, 2016) and school (Eggum et al., 2011;
Farrant, Devine, Maybery, & Fletcher, 2012) years. The limited number of studies that have explored this
topic in toddlerhood suggest that emotion knowledge also plays a role in the occurrence of early prosocial
behaviors. For example, based on cross-sectional research with toddlers, Ensor and Hughes (2005) reported
that emotion understanding made a unique significant contribution to variance in prosocial behaviors.
These findings were replicated by Ensor, Spencer, and Hughes (2011) in a longitudinal study: Children were
assessed at three time points from 2 to 4 years of age, and regression analyses showed that performance on
emotion understanding tasks at age 3 predicted prosocial behaviors at age 4.

The literature has also been enriched by intervention studies exploring the effects of actively
engaging toddlers and preschoolers in dyadic or group conversations about emotions. Such dis-
courses enhance both young children’s awareness of internal states in others and their understanding
of emotions, consequently also impacting on their ability to identify when and how to respond
prosocially (Brownell, Svetlova, Anderson, Nichols, & Drummond, 2013; Garner, Dunsmore, &
Southam-Gerrow, 2008; Grazzani, Ornaghi, Agliati, et al., 2016; Ornaghi, Brazzelli, Grazzani,
Agliati, & Lucarelli, 2017; Ornaghi, Grazzani, Cherubin, Conte, & Piralli, 2015).

Despite the compelling nature of this evidence, findings from other studies have called into question
the strength of such associations. For example, no relations between emotion knowledge and prosocial
behaviors were found when prosocial actions were directly observed during free play sessions at day care
centers (Denham, 1986); in contrast, associations emerged when prosocial behaviors were observed
during experimental tasks and structured play situations (Denham, 1986; Garner et al., 2008) or
measured via questionnaires completed by mothers (Ensor & Hughes, 2005). Hence, it is likely that
the identification of links between social cognition and prosociality may depend on the method used by
researchers to obtain data on prosocial behavior. Furthermore, it is important to note that although
children have a natural inclination to act on behalf of others (Warneken & Tomasello, 2013), in
toddlerhood prosocial actions still occur relatively infrequently (Eisenberg et al., 2015). This may justify
the absence of associations between emotion knowledge and prosocial behaviors in some studies of early
childhood. Finally, the presence or absence of a relationship with emotion understanding may also
depend on the type of prosocial behavior being investigated. For example, comforting is a prosocial
action that requires the child undertaking it to have inferred an emotional state and that may therefore be
more closely related to emotion knowledge than helping or sharing, which are more goal oriented
(Drummond, Hammond, Satlof-Bedrick, Waugh, & Brownell, 2017; Gross et al., 2015).

Regarding the role of theory of mind, little is known about how it relates to prosocial behaviors in early
childhood. In a recent meta-analysis, Imuta et al. (2016) attempted to shed light on this relationship by
analyzing 76 studies conducted with children between 2 and 12 years of age. They concluded that children
who possess an advanced theory of mind are more likely to act prosocially; this link was consistent across
different varieties of prosocial conduct (namely, helping, comforting, and cooperating) but did not apply
to sharing. The relationship between theory of mind and prosocial behavior was independent of age and
gender, although it tended to be stronger in children ages 6 years and older as well as in girls. It is
important to note that this comprehensive meta-analysis revealed that only seven out of 76 studies had
been conducted with children younger than 3 years of age, and none had investigated subtypes of
prosocial behaviors or adopted desire or true-belief understanding measures of theory of mind.

Language abilities and prosocial behavior

Children with limited language abilities are less likely to engage in social interaction, and this
reduces their opportunities to learn cognitive and social skills (Hoff, 2014; Menting et al., 2011;
Rhee et al., 2013). Indeed, there is evidence of an association between language acquisition and
behavioral issues from the preschool years through middle childhood and adolescence: Specifically,

EARLY EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT

children with poorer language skills are at increased risk for being rejected by peers and developing
externalizing behavior problems (Menting et al., 2011). Consistent with this, research on positive
social behaviors has revealed that toddlers’ and preschoolers’ language abilities positively influence
the development of prosocial behavior. Note that longitudinal studies have shown that early
language capacities predict later prosocial actions (Girard, Pingault, Doyle, Falissard, & Tremblay,
2017; Rhee et al., 2013). Interesting findings have also emerged from studies that investigated the
relationship between language and prosociality while assessing whether it was mediated by social
cognition skills. For example, Ensor and Hughes (2005) found that verbal abilities influenced
prosocial behaviors in 20- to 36-month-old children and that this association was mediated by
emotion understanding. Similar mediation analyses were performed by Ornaghi et al. (2016) in a
study with older children, specifically 4- to 6-year-olds: It is interesting that in this case, both
language and theory of mind contributed to mediating the effect of emotion comprehension on
prosocial orientation.

In sum, the existing research on early childhood suggests that language plays a role in the
occurrence of prosocial behaviors, although it is still unclear whether this link drives or is driven
by associations between social cognition skills and prosocial conduct. More advanced language
abilities might be expected to facilitate social interaction, thereby enhancing children’s ability to
recognize another person’s need or difficulty—that is to say, their social cognition. This in turn
should progressively enable them to select and implement appropriate prosocial responses. At the
same time, prosocial behaviors might promote further positive exchanges with peers, thus fostering
the development of social cognition skills with the concurrent intervention of language abilities.

Gender differences
With regard to gender, the existing literature on children’s social cognition reports mixed findings.
Some studies have indicated that girls score more highly than boys on measures of emotion knowl-
edge (Gross et al., 2015; Sette, Bassett, Baumgartner, & Denham, 2015) and theory of mind
(Charman, Ruffman, & Clements, 2002). In contrast, other research with toddlers and preschoolers
has found no gender differences in either emotion knowledge (Ensor & Hughes, 2005; Grazzani,
Ornaghi, Agliati, et al., 2016) or theory-of-mind competence (Eggum et al., 2011; LaBounty,
Wellman, Olson, Lagattuta, & Liu, 2007; Wellman & Liu, 2004).

The situation is no clearer with regard to gender differences in language abilities. Some studies
have reported that on average girls display stronger language skills than boys (Bornstein, Hahn, &
Haynes, 2004; Rhee et al., 2013). This finding was partially supported by a broad meta-analysis
(Eriksson et al., 2012) indicating that gender differences existed across different non-English-
language communities. Specifically, girls tended to be linguistically ahead of boys, but the extent
of this advantage depended on age, language community, and the specific language skill assessed,
which suggests that these potential confounding variables may explain the mixed findings reported
on the association between language and gender (Barnett, Gustafsson, Deng, Mills-Koonce, & Cox,
2012; Eriksson et al., 2012; Girard et al., 2017; Pepe & Addimando, 2014).

Similarly conflicting findings have emerged in relation to the role of gender in prosocial behavior.
Some studies have identified no gender differences in prosociality (Denham et al., 2012; Dunfield
et al., 2011; Wu & Su, 2014), whereas others suggest that girls display more prosocial behaviors than
boys during toddlerhood and the early preschool period (Baillargeon et al., 2011; Eisenberg & Fabes,
1998; Girard et al., 2017; Rhee et al., 2013; Tisak, Holub, & Tisak, 2007). These gender-related
differences may be underpinned by cultural expectations and parental socialization practices.
Specifically, gender stereotypes define girls as caring, responsive, and helpful, whereas boys are
expected to be more independent and goal oriented (Eisenberg et al., 2015). Children’s caregivers
may encourage behaviors that match these stereotyped roles, thus socializing boys and girls in
different ways (Baker, Tisak, & Tisak, 2016; Denham, Bassett, & Wyatt, 2010).

The present study

The main goal of this study was to investigate the impact of social cognition skills, namely, emotion
knowledge and theory of mind, and language on the occurrence of prosocial behaviors in 2- and 3-
year-olds while taking into account the role of age and gender. To date, little research has been
conducted on the relations among these variables in early childhood, with especially few studies
applying a multitrait mixed-methods approach.

Our first research hypothesis, in line with the current literature, was that the three varieties of
prosocial behaviors (i.e., helping, sharing, and comforting) would not be related to one another.
Moreover, we expected that prosocial behaviors in general would be positively associated with social
cognition skills and language. Finally, we expected that emotion knowledge, theory of mind, and
language would all contribute to accounting for the occurrence of prosocial behaviors.

Method

Participants

Participants were 149 Italian children ages 24 to 47 months (M age = 35.6 months, SD = 6.77 months;
75 girls, 74 boys) enrolled at 18 day care centers and kindergartens in northern Italy. Of the children,
79 (53%) were 2-year-olds (M age = 30.2 months, SD = 3.17 months; 45 girls, 34 boys) and 70 (47%)
were 3-year-olds (M age = 41.8 months, SD = 3.73 months; 30 girls, 40 boys). Most were Caucasian
(94%). All participants displayed typical development and came from working- and middle-class
families, as reported in a sociodemographic questionnaire completed by their parents. All parents
provided written informed consent at the outset of the study.

Procedure

A multitrait mixed-methods design was adopted consisting of both directly administered tasks and
naturalistic observation. The children were tested individually in a quiet room at their own schools.
Overall, the assessment lasted approximately 20 min, and the tasks were presented in a counter-
balanced order. Each child was also observed individually over a series of free play sessions that took
place on different days. Educators and teachers were encouraged to intervene as little as possible
during the observation sessions.

Measures

Emotion knowledge
In order to assess the children’s understanding of basic emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger,
fear), we administered the short form of the Affect Knowledge Test (Denham, 1986; Italian validated
version by Camodeca & Coppola, 2010). This task uses a set of four emotion faces and puppets with
blank faces. Specifically, it evaluates children’s ability to label emotions (expressive task, four items;
“How does she feel?”), recognize emotions (receptive task, four items; e.g., “Point to the sad face”),
and identify others’ emotions in typical situations (stereotypical script, three items that refer to
anger, sadness, and fear) and atypical situations (nonstereotypical script, six items). In the
stereotypical scripts, the puppet displays the emotion that most children would feel in the described
scenario (e.g., in the script concerning anger, Nancy knocks down the tower that Johnny has just
finished building), whereas in the nonstereotypical scripts it expresses a different emotion than
the child would normally experience, as indicated by an educator or teacher in a short questionnaire
about the child’s emotional responses in common everyday situations (e.g., if the child’s least favorite
food is meat, in the script the puppet is happy to know that he or she is going to have meat for
lunch). Participants received a score of 2 for a correct response, 1 for an incorrect response with the
correct emotional valence, and 0 for a completely inappropriate response. As recommended in the

EARLY EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT

7

literature (Bassett et al., 2012; Sette et al., 2015), two composite scores were assigned: The emotion
recognition score was the sum of the scores obtained on the expressive and receptive tasks and
ranged from 0 to 16 (α = .82). The emotion situation knowledge score was the sum of the scores
obtained on the stereotypical and nonstereotypical script tasks and ranged from 0 to 18 (α = .77).

Theory of mind
Children’s theory-of-mind competence was evaluated using a battery of two tasks, specifically the
Italian translations of the Diverse-Desire Task (Wellman & Liu, 2004) and the True-Belief Task
(Wellman, 1991), which assess, respectively, children’s understanding that other people can have
desires that differ from their own and that others can hold true beliefs. These measures of theory of
mind were selected on the basis that they are suited to the age groups under study and known to be
reliable in the Italian context (Liverta Sempio, Marchetti, Castelli, Lecciso, & Pezzotta, 2005). For
each task, children scored 1 point for a correct answer and 0 points for an incorrect answer. Hence,
the total score for each task ranged from 0 to 1, which means that the test was either passed or failed.
Raykov’s (1997) composite reliability coefficient for the theory-of-mind scores was .70.

Language
The Italian version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test–Revised (Stella, Pizzoli, & Tressoldi, 2000)
was administered to provide a measure of children’s receptive vocabulary. It consists of 180 pages of
increasing difficulty, each featuring four pictures from among which the child is asked to indicate the
one that corresponds to the word called out by the examiner. Scoring was carried out following the
standard procedure, with 1 point assigned for each correct answer and 0 points for each wrong answer.
The first five items were not included in the overall score because they are only intended to train the
child in how to respond to the items. Thus, possible scores ranged from 0 to 175.

Prosocial behavior
The Prosocial Behavior Observation Grid was developed ad hoc by the research team to record the
occurrence of children’s spontaneous helping, sharing, and comforting behaviors toward peers in the
school setting (see the Appendix). In devising the instrument, we drew on experimental protocols
described in the literature (Dunfield & Kuhlmeier, 2013; Dunfield et al., 2011), adapting them to suit
naturalistic, paper-and-pencil observation. Two observers, who had previously spent time getting to
know the children and their teachers or educators, were trained in identifying children’s prosocial
behaviors during unstructured free play and entering detailed descriptions of the observed helping,
sharing, and comforting behaviors in the Prosocial Behavior Observation Grid. Following previous
observational research (e.g., Grazzani, Ornaghi, Agliati, et al., 2016), each child was observed for 5 min
on four separate occasions, yielding a total of 20 min of observation time per participant. A single
researcher observed each child while refraining from having any kind of interaction with him or her.
Helping behaviors were reported when a child’s peer was in need of either instrumental assistance or
information. A helping behavior was described as instrumental when a child assisted a classmate’s
goal-directed efforts (e.g., helped another child to free his or her leg from a string) and as informing
when a child provided a peer with needed information or explained how to carry out an activity (e.g.,
by showing a classmate who was struggling to complete a jigsaw puzzle where to place the pieces).
Behaviors were categorized as sharing when a child gave away material things (e.g., food, a toy) to a
peer who had none of this resource and desired or needed it. Comforting behaviors were recorded
when a peer had displayed and/or verbally expressed a negative emotional or physical state; these
included psychological comforting, when the action was intended to modify the other child’s negative
internal state (e.g., kissing a classmate who was crying), and physical comforting, when the action was
intended to soothe another’s physical distress (e.g., rubbing the back of a child who was coughing).
At a later stage, two expert judges, who were different from the observers and unaware of the
purposes of the study,
independently coded the prosocial behaviors reported in the grid. In
particular, they verified that each description of a prosocial behavior was in keeping with the

8

E. CONTE ET AL.

corresponding standard definition of prosocial behavior provided in literature and had been assigned
to the correct category of prosocial behavior. The interrater agreement between the two judges was
κ = .85. In the case of interrater disagreement between the judges, the specific behavior was analyzed
and discussed until unanimous agreement was reached. Finally, three total scores—for helping,
sharing, and comforting, respectively—were calculated by summing the occurrences of each of these
varieties. In the current study, the occurrences of helping and sharing behaviors for each child
ranged from 0 to 2, whereas the occurrence of comforting behaviors ranged from 0 to 3.

Overview of analyses

Preliminary testing of the data suggested that the study variables were generally normally distributed,
with skewness and kurtosis values falling within the accepted range of ±2 (George & Mallery, 2010).
The only exception was comforting prosocial behavior: Even after the scores for comforting had
been transformed statistically, they continued to be highly skewed, and consequently the comforting
dimension of prosocial behavior was not included in any of the subsequent analyses.

Next correlations between helping and sharing prosocial behaviors were computed. Then correla-
tions between emotion knowledge, theory-of-mind understanding, language, prosocial behaviors,
age, and gender were calculated. In order to avoid Type I error, we applied a Bonferroni correction
(Frane, 2015); p was set at .01.

Finally, to investigate the relationship between children’s prosocial data (scores for the outcome
variables ranging from 0 to 2) and the other study variables, we performed ordinal logistic regression
analyses (as suggested by Fox, 2008). The initial model was set to have the occurrences of two
different prosocial observed behaviors (helping and sharing) as the target variables, theory-of-mind
scores as a fixed-effect variable, and language and emotion knowledge as covariates. Finally, age and
gender were entered as control variables. The effects of theory-of-mind performance, language, and
emotion knowledge were evaluated. We compared models by testing the fit of the full-null model
with the null model and evaluating measures of likelihood. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to measure effect sizes and evaluate the associations of
the other variables with prosocial behaviors. The Mahalanobis distance criterion (p > .001) was used
to identify and skip multivariate outliers. As a result, four outliers were removed. We conducted
statistical analyses in SPSS using raw unstandardized scores for each of the measures.

correlations are presented in Table 2. Prosocial behaviors were not significantly correlated. With regard to
the link between prosociality and the other variables in the research design, helping was significantly
correlated with emotion situation knowledge (r = .35, p < .001) and language competence (r = .30,
p < .001). Indeed, language was significantly correlated with all social cognition skills except for true-belief
understanding, with which language displayed a correlation that tended toward statistical significance.
Furthermore, age correlated significantly with scores obtained on all directly administered tasks with the
exception of the true-belief understanding task.

To further clarify whether the associations between study variables remained after the effects of
age group and gender were controlled for, we conducted partial correlation analysis (see Table 3).
Again, the prosocial behaviors were not significantly correlated with one another. Helping continued
to be significantly correlated with emotion situation knowledge (r = .33, p < .001) and language
ability (r = .31, p < .001). Finally, language scores remained significantly associated with both
components of emotion knowledge (rs = .40 with emotion recognition and .43 with emotion
situation knowledge, respectively, p < .001).

Ordinal logistic regression analyses
Ordinal regression analyses were conducted to obtain a more detailed picture of how children’s
social cognition skills and language were related to prosocial behaviors by considering the complex
network of reciprocal associations among them (see Table 4). With regard to helping behaviors, the
test of the full model against the null model was statistically significant, likelihood χ2(5) = 26.45,
p < .001.

This indicates that

the regressors were associated with helping behaviors, Pearson’s χ2
(269) = 246.3, p = .83; pseudo-R2 = .21. A statistically significant effect of emotion situation
knowledge score was found (b = 0.22, p = .006; OR = 1.24, CI [0.061, 0.37]), with higher emotion
situation knowledge scores associated with helping behaviors (if helping score = 0, then M =12.01,
SD = 3.77; if helping score = 1, then M = 13.96, SD = 3.37; if helping score = 2, then M = 15.07, SD =
2.65). The effect of language was small (b = 0.026, p = .069; OR = 1.29, CI [−0.009, 0.062]), and
gender (b = −0.90, p = .027; OR = 0.49, CI [−1.70, 0.102]) had a statistically significant effect, with
boys (M = 0.32, SD = 0.63) displaying fewer helping behaviors than girls (M = 0.53, SD = 0.76). No
statistically significant associations were found for age and theory-of-mind scores. With regard to

sharing behaviors, the full model was statistically significant, likelihood χ2(5) = 13.94, p = .030. This
indicates that all other variables were associated with the response variable, Pearson’s χ2
(269) = 276.1, p = .38; pseudo-R2 = .11. Although this second model accounted for less variance,
the pattern of relations it represented overlapped with that of the first model. A statistically
significant effect of theory of mind was found (b = 0.93, p = .036; OR = 0.39, CI [0.062, 1.82]),
with children who failed both theory-of-mind tasks (M = .33, SD = 0.77) displaying fewer sharing
behaviors than the rest of the sample (M = 0.60, SD = 0.83). Language had a small but statistically
significant effect (b = 0.042, p = .019; OR = 1.52, CI [0.007, 0.077]). There were no significant effects
of gender, but there was a tendency for sharing behavior to vary with age (b = 0.067, p = .057;
OR = 1.95, CI = −0.002, 0.135]), such that older children produced sharing behaviors more
frequently than younger children. No statistically significant associations were found between
sharing behaviors and emotion situation knowledge scores.

Discussion

The general aim of the current study was to investigate the role of social cognition skills and
language in the occurrence of children’s prosocial behaviors while taking into account the effects
of age and gender. There were two main findings. First, helping and sharing behaviors were not
significantly correlated with each other. Second, social cognition skills, language abilities, and the
control variables contributed to explaining helping and sharing behaviors, but according to different
patterns. Specifically, emotion situation knowledge and gender significantly contributed to explain-
ing the occurrence of helping behaviors, with language playing a marginal role; in contrast, theory-
of-mind performance and language abilities mainly accounted for sharing with peers. We now
discuss each of these two major findings in turn.

Associations between helping and sharing

The first major finding was that, as expected, there were no significant associations between helping and
sharing even after we controlled for the effects of age and gender. This result is consistent with the
outcomes of previous studies reported in the literature. For example, Dunfield et al. (2011) investigated
the same varieties of prosocial behavior as we did and found no correlations between helping and sharing
behaviors, although they measured these via standardized prosocial tasks rather than naturalistic obser-
vations. In addition, their sample was younger than ours, which means that the present evidence extends
the age range in which distinct prosocial behaviors have been found to be uncorrelated. Similar results
were reported by Gross et al. (2015) in a study with 18- to 30-month-old toddlers who were administered

EARLY EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT

11

prosocial tasks measuring instrumental helping and sharing. Finally, our finding is also in line with results
obtained by Dunfield and Kuhlmeier (2013) in controlled experiments with 2- to 4-year-old children:
Again, these scholars found that helping and sharing behaviors were not correlated with each other, even
when age was controlled for.

Overall, our findings are consistent with the conceptualization of prosocial behavior as a multi-
faceted and multidimensional construct. They suggest that helping and sharing are independent
behaviors underpinned by distinct sociocognitive mechanisms (Thompson & Newton, 2013).
Indeed, although all prosocial behavior is aimed at alleviating the negative state of another person,
the type of problem and solution involved is different for each variety (Dunfield, 2014; Dunfield &
Kuhlmeier, 2013). Specifically, with regard to the problems being represented, helping requires
recognizing another person’s intention to achieve a goal, whereas sharing demands the ability to
identify unequal access to resources. With regard to the solutions, children must correct unintended
outcomes to help a peer and distribute their own resources if they wish to share something with
someone (Dunfield, 2014).

The contributions of social cognition skills, language, age, and gender to accounting for
variance in helping and sharing behaviors

The second major finding was that the variables under study had different relationships with helping
versus sharing behaviors. As expected, the ordinal regression analyses showed that social cognition
scores were associated with the occurrence of prosocial behaviors. However, the patterns of associa-
tion were different for the two varieties of prosocial conduct, with emotion situation knowledge
accounting for variance in helping and theory of mind explaining variance in sharing.

With regard to helping, our results confirm prior research findings highlighting the role of
emotion knowledge in children’s prosocial orientation (Denham, 1986; Denham et al., 2012; Ensor
& Hughes, 2005; Ensor et al., 2011). Based on their own personal experiences, it may be implicitly
clear to children that being unable to complete a task or achieve a goal causes negative emotions,
such as anger, frustration, and sadness. Hence, it is likely that as early as 2 or 3 years of age, children
can take a peer’s affective perspective and imagine the potential emotional effects of failing to achieve
a given purpose. Given that children intrinsically desire to see others happy (Dunfield, 2014; Hepach,
Vaish, & Tomasello, 2012), it is probable that the outcome of this line of reasoning will be prosocial
helping behavior. The observational data recorded in the grids supported this finding. For instance,
one observer described a free play situation in a day care center in which a boy and girl (the target of
the observation) were making shapes out of play dough. The boy used a cutter to form a person, but
the resulting shape was missing a leg. He looked sadly at his creation and said, “Oh no, it’s broken.”
The girl, who was working on her own play dough, looked at the boy and at his play dough and said,
“I can do it for you.” She went over to the boy, who made room for her, and she helped him to make
a fully formed person shape. It is likely that the girl understood why the boy was sad and realized
that helping would allow him to achieve his goal and consequently make him happy.

On the other side, we found that theory-of-mind performance played a key role in the occurrence
of spontaneous sharing behaviors. It is interesting that children who failed both theory-of-mind tasks
displayed fewer sharing behaviors than children who passed at least one theory-of-mind task. This
outcome bears out the findings of previous studies that identified positive links between theory of
mind and prosocial behavior in the early years of life (Cassidy et al., 2003; Wu & Su, 2014). Again,
the descriptions of sharing behaviors recorded in the observation grids were consistent with the
quantitative results obtained. In a kindergarten, for example, children were drawing and a girl told
the teacher that there were no orange pencils. The target girl glanced at the pen holder and stated, “I
have the orange, here you are,” holding out the pencil she was using. This account suggests that the
girl understood her classmate’s desire for an orange pencil to continue drawing and that this had
prompted her to give up a resource by handing it to her friend.

E. CONTE ET AL.

It is important to note that it might be argued that these results are partly at odds with the findings of
Imuta et al.’s (2016) meta-analysis, in which sharing was reported to be the only variety of prosocial
behavior not associated with theory-of-mind skills. One simple explanation for this seeming contra-
diction may lie in the fact that, as mentioned above, although the meta-analysis concerned subjects from
2 years of age and older, the number of studies involving young children was very small. In contrast, the
participants in our study were specifically 2- and 3-year-olds, an age group with whom caregivers often
emphasize the need for sharing. Indeed, beginning in the early years, children are frequently encouraged
by adults to share toys or food with peers, and this encouragement often takes the form of prompting
them to adopt another person’s point of view. These social experiences shaped by caregivers gradually
lead children to become aware that people desire things and that having access to or being deprived of
such resources can impact on both emotional states and social exchanges (Brownell, Iesue, et al., 2013).
This may have the effect of reinforcing young children’s association between other people’s desires and
the expected sharing behaviors.

In addition to the key contribution of social cognition skills to explaining prosocial behaviors, we
found that language also played a role. This is in line with the scant existing literature concerning the
specific influence of language on prosocial behavior, supporting the idea that prosocial behaviors in
early childhood are underpinned by linguistic skills (Ensor & Hughes, 2005; Girard et al., 2017; Rhee
et al., 2013). Specifically, in the current study, more advanced language abilities significantly encouraged
sharing resources with peers. Given that needs and desires are often conveyed through terms such as
mine and yours, better language abilities may both facilitate children’s understanding of others’ mental
states and improve their ability to efficiently share with others (Brownell, Iesue, et al., 2013).

The role of language skill in prosociality was also confirmed in relation to helping. Although in the
regression model for helping behavior the effect of language only tended toward statistical significance,
the correlation analyses revealed a positive association between language ability and helping that
remained after we controlled for age and gender. This finding suggests an association between language
and helping that is independent of other factors, a plausible outcome given that these variables are
closely bound together in children’s lives and both fulfill a social function. Indeed, language abilities are
primarily social resources that a child can deploy to interact appropriately with others (Hoff, 2014).
Having more advanced language skills will thus help children to engage in positive social exchanges and
to verify that their prosocial actions have been effective, increasing their confidence in their own
abilities. This can make them increasingly attentive toward others’ goals and encourage them to interact
with others, thereby further extending their social opportunities to act on behalf of others.

Finally, with regard to the control variables, the current findings suggest that in toddlerhood girls
engage in more helping behaviors than boys. This outcome contributes to the debate over the role of
gender in prosocial behavior and is in keeping with other studies that have reported that girls are more
prosocially oriented than boys (Baillargeon et al., 2011; Girard et al., 2017; Rhee et al., 2013; Tisak et al.,
2007), especially when prosocial behaviors are measured in naturalistic rather than experimental
contexts (Eisenberg & Fabes, 1998). A possible explanation of these gender-related differences may
lie in early gender socialization, which can foster a representation of girls as more sensitive and helpful
than boys (Eisenberg et al., 2015).

Conclusions

Strengths, limitations, and implications for education

The present study, by adopting a multitrait mixed-methods approach that combined direct testing
with in-depth naturalistic observations of participants, adds key evidence to the growing literature
on both the independence of different types of prosocial conduct and the associations among
emotion knowledge, theory of mind, language abilities, and prosocial behavior in 2- and 3-year-olds.
Nevertheless, the study is not without limitations. First, although we made every effort to
randomize the participating children and education providers, it was not possible to control for

EARLY EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT

13

organizational variables. Specifically, given that the children attended many different day care
centers and kindergartens, and sometimes were also in different classrooms within the same
educational institution, our outcomes could have been affected by differences in educational contexts
and teacher–child relationships, as suggested in the literature (Curby, Brock, & Hamre, 2013;
Denham, Bassett, & Miller, 2017; Hipson & Séguin, 2015). Unfortunately, the overall size of our
sample did not allow us to cluster the data by classroom or educational institution in order to run
more sophisticated analyses. A larger and more diversified sample would not only strengthen the
statistical power of the analyses already conducted but also enable additional in-depth statistical
tests, such as hierarchical linear modeling and mediation analysis.

A second limitation of the study lies in its cross-sectional design. Future research may enhance
understanding of the processes underpinning prosocial behaviors from toddlerhood through child-
hood by adopting a longitudinal design and taking into account other factors that may contribute to
individual differences in the occurrence of prosocial behaviors, such as children’s temperamental
characteristics (Gross et al., 2015; Laible, Carlo, Murphy, Augustine, & Roesch, 2014) and caregivers’
socialization practices (Grazzani, Ornaghi, Agliati, et al., 2016; Ruffman et al., 2006).

A third limitation of the current study lies in the difficulty we encountered in detecting a
sufficient number of spontaneous prosocial behaviors to perform appropriate statistical analyses.
Although the children did spontaneously engage in prosocial conduct, the overall occurrence of
these behaviors was relatively low, which is common in naturalistic observations of free play
(Brownell, Iesue, et al., 2013). Despite the significant amount of time we spent observing children’s
behavior during their interactions with peers, occurrences of comforting behavior were insufficient
to support quantitative analysis of this variety of prosocial behavior. This issue prompts reflection on
the true efficacy of naturalistic observations of spontaneous prosocial behaviors. Future studies on
prosocial conduct and its associations with social cognition skills and language abilities should
supplement naturalistic observations with information obtained via experimental tasks. In addition,
regarding the independence of different prosocial behaviors, neurophysiological assessment might
offer evidence of specific activation patterns. For instance, Paulus, Kuhn-Popp, Licata, Sodian, and
Meinhardt (2013) found significant correlations between frontal activation and infants’ empathic
reactions in a comforting task as well as significant correlations between temporal activation and
infants’ performances in an instrumental helping task.

Despite these shortcomings, our findings strongly encourage those involved in early childhood
education to design training and intervention programs to enhance the emotional, linguistic, and
cognitive skills associated with children’s prosocial behaviors. Interventions that foster these competen-
cies have already proven extremely effective, especially when they have targeted children’s overall
development (Cigala, Mori, & Fangareggi, 2015; Grazzani, Ornaghi, Agliati, et al., 2016; Ornaghi et al.,
2015). Indeed, prosocially oriented children tend to have positive peer relationships, suffer less peer
rejection, and engage in fewer conflicts with peers, all factors that reduce the risk of aggressive behavior
and bullying (Denham et al., 2003). Educational and school settings stand to benefit significantly from ad
hoc intervention programs: A higher proportion of peer interaction based on compassion and respect
rather than on the abuse of power will make for a more peaceful atmosphere. Given that in the current
study the interrelationship among social cognition skills, language, and prosocial behaviors emerged as
early as 24 months, efforts should be made to conduct preventive intervention with children during their
first years of life.
