Longitudinal study

This longitudinal study tested the same children at three time
points: infancy (10.5 months of age), toddlerhood (2.5 years of
age), and early childhood (4.5 years of age). At 10.5 months, infants
were assessed experimentally with a gaze-following paradigm. At
2.5 years, children’s language skills were measured using the
MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventories. At
4.5 years, children’s explicit theory of mind was assessed with a
standard test battery. Analyses revealed that infants with higher
gaze-following scores at 10.5 months produced signiﬁcantly
more mental-state words at 2.5 years and that children with more
mental-state words at 2.5 years were more successful on the
theory-of-mind battery at 4.5 years. These predictive longitudinal
relationships remained signiﬁcant after controlling for general
language, maternal education, and nonsocial attention. The results
illuminate the bridging role that language plays in connecting
infants’ social cognition to children’s later understanding of others’
mental states. The obtained speciﬁcity in the longitudinal relations
informs theories concerning mechanisms of developmental change.

Introduction

By 4 or 5 years of age, children exhibit an explicit understanding of the representational nature of
beliefs (e.g., Gopnik & Astington, 1988; Perner, 1991; Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001). At younger
ages, they understand interrelationships among perception, desire, and intentional action, which
are also integral to the development of a ‘‘theory of mind’’ (ToM) or ‘‘mentalizing’’ (e.g., Flavell,
2004; Meltzoff, 1995; Repacholi & Slaughter, 2003; Wellman, Phillips, & Rodriguez, 2000;
Williamson, Brooks, & Meltzoff, 2013). In this article, we focus on even earlier development—infant
gaze following and children’s talk about the mind. Studying gaze following and its downstream effects
provides insights into mechanisms of change in development and also informs discussions about the
early identiﬁcation and treatment of children with autism spectrum disorders who have deﬁcits in
gaze following (Jones & Klin, 2013; Mundy, Sullivan, & Mastergeorge, 2009; Toth, Munson, Meltzoff,
& Dawson, 2006). Here, we report a longitudinal study with typically developing children that con-
nects the dots between early gaze following, mental-state language use, and later ToM as measured
by a standard test battery (Wellman & Liu, 2004).

At a theoretical level, gaze following has been argued to relate to a child’s concept of mind via at
least two routes. First, it has been thought of as a front-end ability that triggers or enables further
growth along the ToM trajectory (Baron-Cohen, 1995). Second, gaze following promotes early word
learning (Baldwin, 1993, 2000; Brooks & Meltzoff, 2005, 2008; Carpenter, Nagell, & Tomasello,
1998), and this verbal advantage has been argued to support and engender perspective taking and
mentalizing. On the other hand, it has been suggested that infant gaze following may be unrelated
to conceptualizing mental states because gaze following during early infancy could simply be an ori-
enting response to physical movement or spatial cues (e.g., Corkum & Moore, 1998; Doherty, 2006;
Doherty & Anderson, 1999).

Understanding visual perception and ToM

Children’s understanding of visual perception is a key aspect of their grasp of others’ mental states
(e.g., Gopnik & Astington, 1988; Lohmann & Tomasello, 2003; Meltzoff & Brooks, 2008; Pratt & Bryant,
1990; Wellman et al., 2000). Intervention studies provide the strongest evidence; training preschool-
ers on perception tasks improves their understanding of false belief (Slaughter & Gopnik, 1996). It may
be that learning about other people’s visual perception (which has a bodily component in terms of
head and eye direction) gives children leverage to understand deeper, less visible mental states such
as beliefs.

A nascent reaction to the direction of people’s gaze begins during early infancy. At 6 to 9 months of
age, infants turn in the same direction that a person orients (Butterworth & Jarrett, 1991; Corkum &
Moore, 1998; Gredebäck, Fikke, & Melinder, 2010). By 9 to 12 months of age, infants connect the loo-
ker to a focal object (Carpenter et al., 1998; Johnson, Ok, & Luo, 2007; Sodian & Thoermer, 2004;
Woodward, 2003). By 10 to 12 months of age, infants selectively follow the head turns of a person
who has open eyes more often than closed eyes, suggesting that infants recognize that people see with
their eyes and that infants are not simply responding to salient head movement cues (Brooks &
Meltzoff, 2002). By 12 to 18 months of age, a randomized control training study demonstrated that
infants use their own visual experiences (with a visual barrier) to interpret when another person
can and cannot see an object (Meltzoff & Brooks, 2008), providing strong evidence for construing gaze
in a mentalistic framework.

Language development and ToM

Children’s language has consistently been shown to inﬂuence ToM development (Milligan,
Astington, & Dack, 2007; Peterson, Wellman, & Liu, 2005). Many of children’s conversations with
adults and peers concern mental states (de Rosnay & Hughes, 2006). Based on their social interactions
in everyday settings, children increase their mental-state vocabulary and enrich their understanding
of others’ desires, emotions, and beliefs (Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Tesla, & Youngblade, 1991;

R. Brooks, A.N. Meltzoff / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 130 (2015) 67–78

69

Ruffman, Slade, & Crowe, 2002). Children’s production of mental-state terms is speciﬁcally related to
their understanding of beliefs (Ensor & Hughes, 2008; Meins, Fernyhough, Arnott, Leekam, & de
Rosnay, 2013).

Longitudinal prediction studies

Researchers have begun to examine longitudinal relationships between gaze following and later
social–cognitive understanding. Kristen, Sodian, Thoermer, and Perst (2011) assessed gaze following
by having an adult look, vocalize, and point at a target. They found that infants’ responses to this mul-
timodal cue predicted later use of mental-state words. Because the adult’s presentation included
vocalizations, it is unclear how much infants relied exclusively on the adult’s gaze to localize the tar-
get. Infants’ sensitivity to the adult vocalizations themselves could have been a factor in the obtained
predictive relationship with language. Indeed, tests of infant following that disallowed adult vocaliza-
tion did not relate to later performance on mental-state tasks (Colonnesi, Rieffe, Koops, & Perucchini,
2008).

Other studies have measured infant behaviors that were not speciﬁcally gaze following per se but
involved the eyes, such as the number of gaze shifts infants made when looking between an adult and
a target object. Using this measure, there are some reports of correlations between infants’ gaze shift-
ing and later understanding of mental states (Charman et al., 2000; Nelson, Adamson, & Bakeman,
2008). Although these gaze shifts show that infants can disengage their attention from an object to
look at an adult, they do not implicate gaze following per se. Such gaze shifts may reﬂect infants’
growing capacity for attentional control, which may relate to later ToM through an executive function
pathway.

The general issue of infant attentiveness and attentional control has not been controlled in previ-
ous reports of how infant responses to adult gaze may relate to language and ToM development. Gen-
eral attentiveness is an untested ‘‘third factor’’ that could mediate obtained relationships between
gaze following and other concurrent or subsequent social cognition (e.g., Colonnesi et al., 2008;
Kristen et al., 2011).

Study rationale and aims

To begin to connect the dots in a longitudinal study, we tested the same children at three points in
development: infancy (10.5 months of age), toddlerhood (2.5 years of age), and early childhood
(4.5 years of age) and measured gaze following, productive vocabulary (including mental-state terms),
and explicit ToM, respectively. A strength of this study is that we examined the speciﬁcity of the lon-
gitudinal relations. The relations were examined while controlling for general language and maternal
education, which are known to be mediators of longitudinal relationships in social cognition (e.g.,
Cutting & Dunn, 1999; Hughes et al., 2014). We also assessed infants’ looking during a nonsocial atten-
tion task to provide control data on infants’ general visual attentiveness to targets.

The current work capitalized on the opportunity to retest children who participated in a nonverbal
assessment of gaze following when they were infants (Brooks & Meltzoff, 2008). We followed the chil-
dren longitudinally to assess (a) whether infants’ gaze following at 10.5 months of age speciﬁcally
predicts toddlers’ acquisition of mental-state terms at 2.5 years of age and (b) whether differences
in these early skills predict children’s later scores on a standard ToM battery at 4.5 years of age.

Method

Participants

A total of 32 infants (16 boys) were originally tested at 10.5 months of age (M = 10.53 months,
SD = 0.54) in a study of gaze following (Brooks & Meltzoff, 2008). In the longitudinal follow-up
reported here, 5 of the original families were unable to participate at 2.5 years of age because they
declined (n = 1), did not have time to complete forms (n = 2), or could not be reached (n = 2). Thus,

70

27 children (14 boys) were assessed when they were 2.5 years old (M = 2.51 years, SD = 0.02). Of these
children, 19 (11 boys) were retested when they were 4.5 years old (M = 4.53 years, SD = 0.07). The
other 8 children were unable to participate at 4.5 years because their parents declined (n = 1), moved
(n = 3), or could not be reached (n = 4). In total, 59% (19 of 32) of the children originally tested during
early infancy provided complete data at all time points through 4.5 years of age, which is comparable
to (a) the retention rates of other longitudinal work (Wellman, Lopez-Duran, LaBounty, & Hamilton,
2008; Yamaguchi, Kuhlmeier, Wynn, & vanMarle, 2009) and (b) the ﬁnal sample size reported in pre-
vious longitudinal studies spanning from infancy to preschool tests of ToM (Aschersleben, Hofer, &
Jovanovic, 2008; Charman et al., 2000).

Parents identiﬁed 74% of the children as White, 5% as Black, and 21% as more than one ethnicity/
race for the longitudinal group. Mothers reported their educational degrees as ranging from high
school to advanced degrees, with a mean of a 4-year university degree (M = 16.63 years of schooling,
SD = 1.98). Families received a small gift at each assessment.

Procedures and measures

The longitudinal study included data from 10.5 months, 2.5 years, and 4.5 years of age.

Test at 10.5 months

Infants sat on their parent’s lap across the table from an experimenter in the laboratory. The gaze-
following task was administered before the nonsocial-looking task to prevent task interference. (The
latter task had activated targets, which could inﬂuence the infants’ gaze-following responses.)

Gaze following. Infants participated in a gaze-following task with distal stationary targets (9 cm diam-
eter  16 cm tall). There were two identical colorful targets, 75° to the left and right of the infant
(135 cm away from infant midline), placed at the infant’s eye level on pedestals. As reported by
Brooks and Meltzoff (2008), there were four 6.5-s test trials in the original assessment of gaze follow-
ing. The experimenter made eye contact with the infant to conﬁrm that the infant was at midline
before looking at a target. The experimenter silently turned her head and eyes with a neutral expres-
sion toward one of the two distal targets.

Infants’ looking was scored from video by a coder who was kept blind to the direction of the exper-
imenter’s head turn and the hypotheses of the study. As is common in the laboratory-based gaze-
following literature, the ﬁrst ‘‘correct look’’ in each trial was scored when the infant’s eyes aligned with
the experimenter’s target (e.g., Gredebäck et al., 2010) and used in the statistical analysis. The ‘‘gaze-
following’’ score was calculated as the average duration of correct looks—that is, the total duration of
correct looks divided by the number of correct looks (as scored by Brooks & Meltzoff, 2008). (A score of
0 was given to infants who had no correct looks.) An independent coder also scored 25% of the infants’
videos to test for coder agreement. Intercoder agreement (Cohen’s j) was .95 for gaze following.

Nonsocial looking. A nonsocial-looking task was also administered. This task used remotely activated
mechanical targets (24 cm long  12 cm wide  14 cm tall) that sat on the pedestals. The two identi-
cal targets were toy pigs programmed to move their noses and tails while emitting a sound and then to
move their legs (although the targets were anchored to stay in one place). During the two trials,
the experimenter remained neutral with a pleasant demeanor and looked forward without looking
at the activated targets. One infant did not complete this task because of mechanical problems with
the targets.

A coder scored infants’ looking from video and was kept blind to the target activation and the
hypotheses of the study. The ‘‘nonsocial-looking’’ score was the average duration of correct looks
across the two trials. An independent coder scored 25% of the infants’ videos for coder agreement.
The intercoder agreement (Cohen’s j) was .98.

Test at 2.5 years

We assessed children’s productive vocabulary. Parents were mailed two standardized forms from
the MacArthur–Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI): the Words and Sentences

R. Brooks, A.N. Meltzoff / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 130 (2015) 67–78

71

form (680 words appropriate for ages 1.5–2.5 years) and the Level III form (100 words appropriate
for ages 2.5–3.1 years). The forms are valid and reliable measures of children’s productive vocabu-
lary (Fenson et al., 2007). Two language scores were derived from the CDI forms (similar to
Meins et al., 2013).

Mental-state terms. The CDI forms yielded a score for children’s production of 15 mental-state terms
from three categories: cognition (4 words: ‘‘forget,’’ ‘‘idea,’’ ‘‘pretend,’’ and ‘‘think’’), desire (3 words:
‘‘need,’’ ‘‘wanna’’ or ‘‘want to,’’ and ‘‘wish’’), and emotion (8 words: ‘‘angry,’’ ‘‘happy,’’ ‘‘hate,’’ ‘‘like,’’
‘‘love,’’ ‘‘mad,’’ ‘‘sad,’’ and ‘‘scared’’). These words were the most common mental-state terms pro-
duced by young children (e.g., Bartsch & Wellman, 1995; Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982; Brown &
Dunn, 1991; Shatz, Wellman, & Silber, 1983).

Nonmental terms. The CDI forms also yielded a score for children’s production of nonmental vocabu-
lary. Most of the mental terms were predicates (verbs and adjectives, which are categorized as action
and descriptive words on the CDI; Bates et al., 1994). Thus, the ‘‘nonmental terms’’ were the number of
action and descriptive words minus the number of mental-state terms.

Test at 4.5 years

Children were evaluated in the laboratory by experimenters who were kept blind to the results of

the children’s previous assessments.

Verbal ability. Children’s verbal comprehension was assessed with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary
Test (PPVT, 3rd edition), which has high internal consistency and validity (Dunn & Dunn, 1997).
The administration of the PPVT was abridged to word lists for children aged 5 to 7 years to test
age-appropriate verbal comprehension. Those items were assigned raw scores based on PPVT scoring
instructions, resulting in a possible range of 25 to 72.

ToM. The experimenter administered ﬁve tasks from Wellman and Liu’s (2004) explicit ToM scale and
an additional false-belief task (as in Wellman et al., 2008). D. Liu (personal communication, October
2006) provided a minor modiﬁcation to one task (i.e., to use the hidden emotion task from
LaBounty, Wellman, Olson, Lagattuta, & Liu, 2008) and provided the change-of-location task. A ﬁxed
presentation order was used for the six tasks: (1) diverse desires, (2) knowledge acquisition, (3) false
belief (unexpected contents), (4) diverse beliefs, (5) hidden emotions, and (6) false belief (changed
location).

Scoring rules from Wellman and Liu (2004) were used to code children from video. Children were
scored as ‘‘correct’’ if they correctly answered the test and the associated control questions. Two scores
were derived as described by Wellman and colleagues (2008). The overall ToM score was the total
number of correct scores from the ﬁrst ﬁve tasks (possible range of 0–5). The ‘‘false-belief’’ (FB) score
was the total number of correct scores from Tasks 3 and 6 (possible range of 0–2).

In addition to the primary scorer, an independent coder reviewed 25% of the children’s videos to
test coder agreement. The coder was blind to the children’s previous scores. Intercoder agreement
was 1.00 (Cohen’s j).

Results

Preliminary analyses

Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics for the children in the longitudinal study. The infants who
were assessed at 2.5 and 4.5 years of age had scores consistent with the entire group of infants orig-
inally tested at 10.5 months of age (N = 32). More speciﬁcally, both the gaze-following and nonsocial-
looking scores were not signiﬁcantly different between infants assessed at 2.5 years (N = 27) and those
who were not assessed at 2.5 years (ps > .30), nor were there any signiﬁcant differences between

Main analyses

First, longitudinal associations were assessed using Pearson correlations. (Nonparametric Spear-
man rank–order correlations yielded similar results.) Second, longitudinal relationships were submit-
ted to hierarchical regression analyses to examine whether longitudinal associations were signiﬁcant
after controlling for general language. Follow-up analyses were conducted with individual categories
of mental states.

Longitudinal relationships between infant scores and language at 2.5 years

The behavior from infant social and nonsocial gaze tasks were tested as correlates of nonmental

and mental-state terms.

Gaze following. Infant gaze following at 10.5 months of age was evaluated as a predictor of children’s
language at 2.5 years of age. Infant gaze following was highly correlated with children’s subsequent
use of mental-state terms at 2.5 years, r(25) = .53, p = .005. Infant gaze following was also correlated
with the use of nonmental terms at 2.5 years, r(25) = .40, p = .041.

A secondary analysis tested whether socioeconomic status (SES) was a covariate of measures at
2.5 years of age. Maternal education (as a proxy for SES) did not signiﬁcantly correlate with toddler
mental-state terms, r(25) = .11, p = .59, or nonmental terms, r(25) = –.007, p = .97, nor did it correlate
with infant gaze following, r(25) = .21, p = .29.

A hierarchical regression analysis tested the predictors of mental-state terms at 2.5 years of age
(Table 2), evaluating whether the relationship between gaze following and mental-state terms
remained signiﬁcant after accounting for general vocabulary. The analysis included only measures
with signiﬁcant correlations in this study to limit the number of variables. In Step 1, nonmental terms
(2.5 years) were entered as a control for general vocabulary and were found to be a signiﬁcant predic-
tor of concurrent mental-state terms (p < .0001). In Step 2, gaze following signiﬁcantly predicted
mental-state terms (p = .043) after controlling for nonmental terms. Thus, infants who had higher
gaze-following scores subsequently used more mental-state terms at 2.5 years even after accounting
for their general vocabulary.

At an even ﬁner level, infant gaze following at 10.5 months of age was positively correlated with
individual categories of mental-state terms at 2.5 years of age. Gaze following signiﬁcantly correlated

with the number of cognition, desire, and emotion words (rs ranged from .45 to .54 and ps ranged from
.018 to .004). Gaze following still signiﬁcantly correlated with cognition terms after controlling for
nonmental terms, partial r(24) = .40, p = .043. Gaze following did not signiﬁcantly correlate with the
two other categories after controlling for nonmental terms: desire, partial r(24) = .32, p = .11; emotion,
partial r(24) = .24, p = .23. In the Discussion, we examine how these ﬁndings of ‘‘speciﬁcity’’ ﬁt with
and also advance previous longitudinal studies (Kristen et al., 2011).

Nonsocial looking (control). Infants’ nonsocial looking at 10.5 months of age did not signiﬁcantly cor-
relate with their nonmental terms at 2.5 years of age, r(24) = .22, p = .28. Nonsocial looking also did not
signiﬁcantly correlate with mental-state terms at 2.5 years, r(24) = .29, p = .15. Thus, infant nonsocial
attention did not relate to the subsequent use of mental or nonmental terms.

A hierarchical regression analysis tested whether mental-state terms were predicted by gaze fol-
lowing after controlling for nonsocial looking. In Step 1, nonsocial looking was entered as a control
for general (nonsocial) attention (b = .29, R2 = .08, p = .15). In Step 2, gaze following was still a signif-
icant predictor of mental-state terms (b = .49, p = .016), DR2 = .21, F(1, 23) = 6.71, p = .016, after con-
trolling for nonsocial looking (b = .10, p = .59). Thus, gaze following, rather than general visual
attentiveness, predicted mental-state terms, again suggesting interesting speciﬁcity, as discussed
later.

Longitudinal relationships between toddler language and ToM at 4.5 years

Nonmental terms at 2.5 years of age correlated with ToM scores at 4.5 years of age, r(17) = .48,
p = .038, but not when PPVT (at 4.5 years) was controlled, partial r(16) = .29, p = .25. Nonmental terms
did not signiﬁcantly correlate with FB scores at 4.5 years, r(17) = .35, p = .14. Infant gaze following and
nonsocial looking were not signiﬁcantly correlated with ToM and FB at 4.5 years (ps > .45), a point
taken up in the Discussion.

The use of mental-state terms at 2.5 years of age was evaluated as a predictor of ToM and FB scores
at 4.5 years of age. Children’s mental-state terms at 2.5 years signiﬁcantly predicted their ToM scores
at 4.5 years, r(17) = .57, p = .01; with PPVT controlled, partial r(16) = .40, p = .10. They showed even
stronger predictions for FB scores in particular, r(17) = .61, p = .005; with PPVT controlled, partial
r(16) = .50, p = .04.

A secondary analysis examined whether verbal ability and SES were covariates of false belief at
4.5 years of age. Concurrent PPVT scores (an index of children’s verbal ability) signiﬁcantly correlated
with FB scores, r(17) = .48, p = .026. Maternal education (a proxy for SES) signiﬁcantly correlated with
FB scores, r(17) = .56, p = .012, and with PPVT, r(17) = .46, p = .045.

A hierarchical regression analysis tested the predictors of false-belief understanding at 4.5 years of
age (Table 3). This analysis evaluated whether the relationship between mental-state terms and FB
scores remained signiﬁcant after accounting for SES and general verbal ability. The analysis included
only the measures with signiﬁcant correlations so as to limit the number of variables. In Step 1, two
control measures were entered: (a) maternal education to control for SES and (b) PPVT (at 4.5 years) to
control for verbal ability. Together these measures signiﬁcantly (p = .032) predicted FB scores at
4.5 years. In Step 2, mental-state terms signiﬁcantly (p = .034) predicted FB scores after controlling
for maternal education and general verbal ability. Thus, toddlers who used more mental-state terms

at 2.5 years of age also succeeded on more false-belief tasks even after controlling for maternal edu-
cation and children’s verbal ability.

At a ﬁner level of detail, follow-up analyses revealed that a particular category of mental-state
terms at 2.5 years of age signiﬁcantly correlated with performance on false-belief tasks at 4.5 years
of age after controlling for maternal education and children’s general verbal ability at 4.5 years. After
controlling for maternal education and PPVT, cognition terms were signiﬁcantly correlated with FB
scores, partial r(15) = .49, p = .046. Desire and emotion terms did not reach statistical signiﬁcance, par-
tial r(15) = .48, p = .053, and partial r(15) = .45, p = .073, respectively. Thus, children who used more
cognition terms at 2.5 years had better performance on explicit false-belief tasks at 4.5 years even
after controlling for general language ability and maternal education.

Discussion

The current work shows longitudinal predictive relations among infant gaze following, toddler lan-
guage, and childhood ToM performance even after controlling for children’s general verbal ability. Two
speciﬁc longitudinal relations that are relevant to developmental theory emerged. The ﬁrst is the sig-
niﬁcant connection from infants’ gaze following at 10.5 months of age to their later production of
mental-state terms at 2.5 years of age. Gaze following was assessed before infants began talking,
yet it predicted the use of mental-state terms more than 1.5 years later. Crucially, the relationship
between gaze following and mental-state terms was not explained by infant general (nonsocial) atten-
tion or more general toddler vocabulary size. The second key ﬁnding was that children’s use of mental-
state terms at 2.5 years strongly predicted their later understanding of false belief at 4.5 years.

These results suggest that infant gaze following plays a quantiﬁable developmental role in chil-
dren’s early linguistic and social–cognitive development. Gaze following relates to later production
of mental-state terms (especially about cognition). The link from gaze following to cognition words
accords with recent work about children’s rich understanding of visual perception (Moll, Meltzoff,
Merzsch, & Tomasello, 2013; Moll & Tomasello, 2006). Perhaps infants’ own experiences with seeing
supports an understanding of how others visually acquire information—Meltzoff’s (2007, 2013) ‘‘like
me’’ idea. This cognitive understanding could then be coded in language—following models of how
early cognition supports speciﬁc aspects of semantic development (e.g., Carey, 2009; Gopnik &
Meltzoff, 1986; Markman, 1989).

The current results assess the speciﬁcity of developmental relations and support, but go beyond,
the more global view that children’s verbal ability is important for the development of ToM (for
reviews, see Milligan et al., 2007; San Juan & Astington, 2012). In the ﬁndings reported here, general
verbal ability was examined and controlled. First, we used a list of nonmental terms to closely match
to the mental-state terms. Second, we assessed and controlled for general verbal ability at 4.5 years of
age using a standardized test (PPVT). With these controls for language, gaze following predicted later
mental-state terms and mental-state terms predicted later ToM, suggesting theoretically relevant
speciﬁcity in development.

At ﬁrst blush, one might be surprised that infant gaze-following skills did not directly predict pre-
schooler ToM performance at 4.5 years of age. A close reading of the previous longitudinal studies
indicates that this is not unexpected, although a small sample size may be a limiting factor in the

current study. Past studies assessing correlations between various measures of joint attention and
later social–cognitive tasks have yielded mixed results even when some used larger samples than
the current study (e.g., Camaioni, Perucchini, Bellagamba, & Colonnesi, 2004; Charman et al., 2000;
Colonnesi et al., 2008). A possible procedural reason for differences among the ﬁndings is that some
studies incorporate adult vocalizations into their infant assessment (e.g., Kristen et al., 2011; Nelson
et al., 2008). In such studies, it is difﬁcult to know which factors (i.e., gaze or language sensitivity)
underlie the observed longitudinal relationships. In the current study, the infant gaze-following
assessment intentionally did not include verbal cues; despite this, infants’ gaze following predicted
mental-state terms (even after controlling for children’s general vocabulary). Thus, gaze following
related to mental-state vocabulary over and above children’s more general language competence.

The current ﬁndings differ from longitudinal studies that have assessed other aspects of infant
social cognition, notably the understanding of goal-directed acts. These studies reported signiﬁcant
predictive relationships between infant performance and later explicit theory of mind even after
‘‘third factors’’ that might mediate this relation were controlled (e.g., Aschersleben et al., 2008;
Wellman et al., 2008; Yamaguchi et al., 2009). One way of reconciling this apparent difference is to
recognize that infant social cognition might not start as a fully integrated psychological system.
Particular infant behaviors (e.g., understanding goal-directed acts) may be contributors to aspects of
subsequent social cognition, whereas other infant behaviors (e.g., gaze following) have a different
effect on linguistic and social–cognitive development (see also Charman et al., 2000; Flom, Lee, &
Muir, 2007; Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1997; Kristen et al., 2011; Meltzoff, Kuhl, Movellan, & Sejnowski,
2009; Mundy & Newell, 2007).

Gaze following at 10.5 months of age speciﬁcally related to subsequent production of mental-state
terms at 2.5 years of age. It has been argued that, in principle, gaze following could reﬂect children’s
general attentional system (e.g., Mundy et al., 2009), but past longitudinal work did not control for
such a possibility. In the current work, nonsocial looking was speciﬁcally assessed as an index of gen-
eral attentiveness. Even after controlling for nonsocial looking, gaze following remained a signiﬁcant
predictor of children’s use of mental-state terms. (The link between infant gaze following and subse-
quent mental-state language also suggests that infant gaze following is not wholly reducible to the
leanest interpretation of following salient physical movements in the visual ﬁeld.) Following the gaze
of others may help infants to relate visible behavior (e.g., looking) to invisible properties of people
(e.g., seeing or knowing), supporting the acquisition of mental-state terms especially for cognition.
Such a process is highly compatible with the ‘‘speciﬁcity hypothesis’’ linking speciﬁc aspects of early
cognition with speciﬁc aspects of semantic development (Gopnik & Meltzoff, 1986, 1987, 1997).

Gaze following provides infants with a special avenue for learning from conversations with parents,
caregivers, and siblings. Just as infants who follow a person’s line of regard are given a boost in learn-
ing the names of objects (e.g., Baldwin, 2000), infants may also gain an advantage in learning mental-
state terms by following their parents’ looks during discussions. Gaze followers can identify the topic
(e.g., a person, object, or action) and learn about mental states when hearing their parents talk about
psychological experiences connected to that sight (e.g., Repacholi, Meltzoff, Rowe, & Spiewak Toub,
2014). Examinations of parent–child interactions show that parents’ individual styles of using lan-
guage to highlight mental states (sometimes called ‘‘mind-mindedness’’) contribute to children’s
understanding of the mind (Dunn et al., 1991; Ensor & Hughes, 2008; LaBounty et al., 2008; Meins
et al., 2013; Perner, Ruffman, & Leekam, 1994; Ruffman et al., 2002; Sabbagh & Callanan, 1998). Other
work shows that parents tend to talk about higher level mental states (e.g., ‘‘remember’’) yet talk less
often about direct perceptual states (e.g., ‘‘see’’) once their infants become consistent gaze followers
(Slaughter, Peterson, & Carpenter, 2008), suggesting complex developmental relations and intuitive
pedagogy.

The current work has limitations. One limitation is that it had a relatively small sample size (yet the
sample size was similar to other longitudinal studies in this area, including Aschersleben et al., 2008,
and Yamaguchi et al., 2009). A second limitation is that it is a correlational study and causal pathways
were not established. Future longitudinal work with a larger sample and additional assessments
would permit the use of more detailed regression models to address causal pathways from a statistical
viewpoint (e.g., Hughes, Ensor, & Marks, 2011; Meins et al., 2013). A randomized control intervention
would be a stronger test of causal relations. Speciﬁcally, one could design an intervention to change

76

infant gaze following (e.g., Kasari, Paparella, Freeman, & Jahromi, 2008; Meltzoff & Brooks, 2008;
Mundy et al., 2009) with the a priori prediction, based on the current report, that this intervention will
affect subsequent mental-state language and explicit ToM.

The current study also has some notable strengths. The study longitudinally followed an existing
group of infants assessed before they were producing language and tracked them into early childhood.
From a methodological viewpoint, it used different experimenters for assessing infant gaze behaviors
and later ToM performance, thereby rigorously preserving experimental blindness. Moreover, we
made a special effort to test all children so that they were tightly clustered around their target ages.
All but 1 child at the 2.5-year test was assessed within 20 days of the target age of 30 months; all but 3
children at the 4.5-year visit were assessed within 20 days of the target age of 54 months. Given that
children develop rapidly, this tight age clustering may have helped to uncover relationships that more
liberal protocols for age may have missed. Finally, the current work controlled for salient third factors
that might affect the observed relations; the predictive relationships remained signiﬁcant after con-
trolling for maternal education, infants’ nonsocial attention, and children’s verbal skills.

Taken together, the pattern of ﬁndings helps to connect the dots among infancy, language, and the
emergence of an explicit ToM during childhood. The current work speciﬁcally links infants’ gaze
following to their subsequent production of mental-state terms (not just to general vocabulary
development). The results suggest that infants’ gaze following feeds children’s linguistic coding of
psychological concepts (especially cognition words), which in turn supports and predicts explicit
ToM development.

These ﬁndings have implications for children with pervasive developmental disorders character-
ized by deﬁcits in gaze following—for example, children with autism spectrum disorders—because
they would be expected to have downstream deﬁcits following the pathways described here. Interven-
tions seeking to improve gaze following could, in theory, improve children’s developing mental-state
language and their emerging concept of mind. By understanding basic developmental pathways and
mechanisms of change, we can design more speciﬁc and effective treatment protocols for children
who might proﬁt from early interventions (Meltzoff et al., 2009). This would allow us to connect
the dots more completely in both theory and practice.
