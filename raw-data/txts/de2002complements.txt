Abstract

A longitudinal study traced the development of the understanding of false belief
and various measures of spontaneous language production and comprehension over the
course of one year. The subjects were 28 normally developing preschoolers who aver-
aged 3–5 years when the study began. The children were given a battery of tasks to assess
false-belief-understanding and language mastery during four testing periods, with the
contents of the materials varying and counterbalanced. The results of regression analyses
strongly suggest that the mastery of a speciﬁc aspect of syntax, namely tensed comple-
ments, is a precursor and possible prerequisite of successful false-belief performance.

1. Introduction

The usual direction of effect posited between the development of concepts and
the language that encodes them is, quite naturally, that the concepts develop before
the corresponding terms. In fact, Fodor (1975) has argued that it is conceptually
incoherent for it to be otherwise. Nevertheless, some other possible relationships

have been imagined, including the scenario in which the child uses a term with-
out fully knowing what it encodes, and hence is alerted to develop a concept or a
conceptual distinction that was not salient previously (Bowerman, 1996; Gopnik
& Meltzoff, 1993; Nelson, 1996). As in other conceptual domains, the under-
standing of beliefs and states of mind is usually considered prerequisite for cor-
rectly using the linguistic forms that express those concepts (e.g., Tager-Flusberg,
1993). Thus children’s talk about mental states, using verbs such as “want”,
“need”, “think”, “know”, and “remember” is taken as a sign that the concepts
of the corresponding mental states have developed (Bartsch & Wellman, 1995;
Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982; Shatz, Wellman, & Silber, 1983; Wellman, 1990).
Between the ages of 3 and 4 years, children master sentence forms involving men-
tal state verbs and their complements. The timing of this linguistic achievement
roughly coincides with children’s successful performance on standard false-belief
tasks. (Astington & Jenkins, 1995, 1999; Bartsch & Wellman, 1995; de Villiers,
1995a; Tager-Flusberg, 1997).

The representation of others’ states of mind is not only encoded in the use of
corresponding mental verbs, but also in the special syntax of complementation
that these verbs allow. With a mental state verb, it is possible to have a proposition
embedded under that verb:

(1) Sarah thought the earth was ﬂat

and that embedded proposition encodes the contents of Sarah’s mind. Many mod-
ern semanticists and philosophers of language say that the embedded proposition
has a truth value that can only be evaluated with respect to the “possible world”
represented by that mind: its truth is not evaluated with respect to this world, but
with respect to Sarah’s mental world (Hintikka, 1962; Lewis, 1986; Montague,
1974). Therefore, there is an intimate connection between the syntax and seman-
tics of mental verbs and their arguments. A child who did not know that connection
would be confused by a sentence such as (1), and in fact might evaluate the em-
bedded proposition with respect to his own world and deny that the sentence as a
whole was true, or fail to compute a meaning for it. Hence a child who is not able to
represent the semantics of a sentence like (1) is not in a position to understand talk
about false beliefs, or to talk about them in this form, with embedded propositions.
Does an understanding of the semantics of mental verbs and their syntax arise as a
function of mastering the concept of other minds, or might it arise within language
itself, perhaps in a domain more transparent to meaning than mental states, such
as with communication verbs? Consider some evidence from language acquisition
itself.

From several studies on the development of wh-questions, children at an early
age (3–4 years) were shown to be able to interpret “long-distance” wh-questions
of the sort:

(2) When did he say he hurt himself?
(3) How did Big Bird ask to call?

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

1039

That is, allowing an interpretation in which the wh-word originates in the lower
clause, as in the echo question:

(4) He said he hurt himself when?
(5) Big Bird asked to call how?

At the same time, children have been shown to respect the “barrier” introduced
by a medial wh-complementizer, allowing only a “short distance” (ﬁrst clause)
interpretation to sentences such as:

(6) When did he say how he hurt himself?
(7) How did Big Bird ask who to call?

However, a very prevalent error that young children make on such questions is
to answer the medial question, especially if it is an argument such as who or what
(de Villiers, Roeper, & Vainikka, 1990).

Despite success at abstract features of grammar, children of the same age make a
characteristic mistake on long distance questions in which the lower clause involves
a false proposition, for example:

(8) What did the mother say she bought?

where the mother lied, or made a mistake, and said that she bought apples when
she really bought oranges. Children aged between 3 and 4 years old in several pilot
studies answer “oranges” in this latter case, and this response suggests they fail
to incorporate the complement under the scope of the top verb (for further details
and possibilities, see de Villiers, 1999). In this kind of task two things need to be
highlighted:

(a) The verb in question was a verb of communication, not of mental state. It
has been pointed out repeatedly that verbs of communication have many
syntactic and semantic properties that overlap with those of mental state
verbs (Fodor, 1980). In fact, children make the mistake on (8) whether the
verb is one of communication or of mental state.

(b) Even when the verb was one of belief, the task required no computation on
the part of the child about the state of belief or mind of the character: that
information was provided by the story. All the child had to do was represent
and remember it via the linguistic form provided.

The results of several such studies suggest that 3-year-old children have difﬁ-
culty representing the meaning of such a sentence even when the verb in question
is about communication, and even though the answer has just been provided in
the story. Their grammars do not seem to allow the appropriate accommodation of
the proposition from the possible world under the complement-taking verb. As a
result, they appear to ﬁnd a reading in which the question is about reality, namely
“what did the mother buy?”

It is possible that the spurious answers of the “medial” question above also
relate to a failure of appropriate analysis of the complement in English, though the

1040

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

exact status of these answers is a matter for ongoing cross-linguistic research which
examines comparable syntactic structures in other languages (Abdulkarim, 2000;
McDaniel, 1989; McDaniel, Chiu, & Maxﬁeld, 1995; Thornton, 1991).

Children who cannot represent a structure such as (8) in their grammars may
nevertheless be capable of representing it in conceptual structure, i.e., in their
“language of thought” (Fodor, 1975). However, it is worth considering further the
possibility that mastering the linguistic representation, for example with verbs of
communication, might precede mastery of the equivalent conceptual representation
of false beliefs.

Bartsch and Wellman (1995) published an exhaustive analysis of the sponta-
neous speech of young children acquiring the vocabulary and structures for mental
states of desire and belief. In their analysis they found evidence for the use of con-
trastive statements involving false beliefs some months prior to the usual age of
mastery on standard false-belief tasks. The context of such utterances, however, is
always incompletely speciﬁed, and the possibility of closely borrowing from the
input, or using routine forms, is one that must be guarded against. There is also
the difﬁculty that events calling for discussion of false beliefs or statements might
be relatively rare, masking the child’s true competence by lack of opportunity.
Eliciting speech around such events may be a more successful technique, though
the child can always exercise the option not to talk about some aspect of an event.
Astington and Jenkins (1995, 1999) conducted a longitudinal study of the rela-
tionship between language measures and false-belief-understanding in preschool-
ers. With age partialled out, they found that general false-belief-understanding,
summed across four standard tests of false-belief reasoning, was signiﬁcantly cor-
related with measures of syntactic and semantic maturity on the Test of Early
Language Development (TELD). Furthermore the children’s language perfor-
mance predicted their later false-belief performance, but the reverse did not hold.
These data lend credence to the notion that individual differences in age of mas-
tery of false-belief tasks might be connected to the child’s level of linguistic
sophistication, but the level of analysis here is too broad to be interpretable.
Thus the possibility remains, for example, that children who are better at lan-
guage might ﬁnd the false-belief stories easier to follow. Furthermore, the TELD
has no particular subsection devoted to complementation, here regarded as the
critical syntactic ingredient for the successful representation of other’s states of
belief.

The current study attempts to answer some of these questions and test a very
speciﬁc hypothesis about the emergence of false-belief-understanding, namely,
that it rests on the child’s mastery of the grammar (semantics and syntax) of
complementation.

For that reason we attempted a longitudinal study of the sort carried out by
Astington and Jenkins (1995, 1999), only with multiple language assessments as
well as tests of false-belief-understanding. We believed it was particularly impor-
tant to separate out mastery of complementation from other aspects of grammatical
growth, and to assess it in spontaneous speech, via elicitation techniques, and in

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

1041

the speciﬁc story/question technique described above that allowed us to detach it
from the demands of “reading” the character’s mental state.

2. Method

2.1. Subjects

The subjects were 28 children in local preschool and daycare centers, average
age 3–5 years at the start of the study (range 3–1 to 3–10 years). There were 13
boys and 15 girls, all normally ﬂuent in English for their age and native speakers
of English. Two cohorts were run over successive years, with each cohort tested
over the course of 1 year, with identical procedures and materials.

2.2. Procedure

The tasks used were a collection of false-belief tasks and language tasks. The
tasks each had four variants with different content, divided into sets labeled A, B,
C and D. Different orders of these sets were given to different children across the
testing periods, resulting in roughly equal representation of each set of materials
in each testing period. Each round of testing required two or three short sessions
with each child in a separate room, and all sessions were videotaped for later
checking against the on-site coding. The testing was carried out in four session
blocks: October, January/February, May then again in October. We analyze here
only the ﬁrst three sessions since by the October 2 all the children but one were
passing false belief tasks.

3. False-belief tasks

3.1. Unexpected Contents (Perner, Leekam, & Wimmer, 1987)

In this task, the child was presented with a familiar candy container, say a
Smarties tube, which they then opened and found to be full of pencils. Then
they were told that a classmate (say, Sarah) will be brought in, and are asked
e.g., “What will Sarah think is in the box?” The child was also asked, “Before,
when you were sitting over there, what did you think was in the box?” In this
standard Unexpected Contents task, 3-year-old children are prone to say that
Sarah will think there are pencils in the box, apparently failing to understand
that the other person’s beliefs may be false. Furthermore, children are often un-
able to report what they ﬁrst believed was in the candy box (Gopnik & Astington,
1988).

We used four different containers with Unexpected Contents, one in each round
of testing, and asked both about the child’s own prior belief and their friend’s

1042

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

likely belief, for a total of 2 points. The containers chosen to be most familiar
were: a Band-Aids tin, a small raisins box, a small milk carton, and a Playdoh
container.

3.2. Unseen displacement (Wimmer & Perner, 1983)

In this type of task, a child is told a story which is acted out in front of her, and
in the story a character comes to hold a false belief about the whereabouts of an
object. The child must then predict where the character will ﬁrst look (Siegal &
Beattie, 1991) for that object.

Story: This boy Bobby and his daddy bought a nice cake for after dinner. But
Bobby wanted to go out to play so he put the cake away until after dinner. He put it
in this cupboard for later. Then he went out to play. Then the daddy thought, “Oh,
no, the frosting on the cake might melt!,” so he took the cake out of the cupboard
and put it in the refrigerator so the frosting wouldn’t melt. Then he went out to get
some tomatoes for dinner.

Memory check questions: Where did Bobby put the cake? Where is it now?
False-belief question: Now Bobby is tired of playing and he’s coming home.
He remembers where he put the cake. When he comes in the kitchen, where will
Bobby ﬁrst look for the cake?

Explanation question: Why will he look there?
The mistake made by a child who fails to take into account Bobby’s knowl-
edge is to say he will look in the refrigerator, that is, where the cake really
is. Children who take into account the difference between the character’s be-
lief and their own say he will look in the cupboard. However, we also ask the
question “why will he look there?” and ﬁnd, like in other reports, that chil-
dren may correctly identify the place the character would look without giving
appropriate explanations. Because chance is 50/50 for identifying the right lo-
cation, the problem lies in interpreting this answer. Leslie (1994) argued that
the best guarantee that the answer was not by chance was to use a SEE con-
trol, in which the character sees the object moved, and thus has a true belief.
We did not choose a SEE control, but rather considered whether the child gave
a suitable explanation for the character looking in the wrong location. This ex-
planation did not have to require mentalistic vocabulary. Thus, saying “because
he put it there” counted as a perfectly adequate answer. An answer that did not
count as adequate might be saying, “because the dad moved it”, since such an
explanation fails to account for why the character chose to look in the wrong
place, and seems more appropriate to the question, “why did he not ﬁnd it?”.
We thus scored the “Prediction” measure both leniently and conservatively, with
the latter counting not just the choice of where the character would look, but
also the reasonable justiﬁcation for that choice. The child received two such
stories on any round, for a total of 2 points for “Prediction” or for “Justiﬁed
Prediction”.

3.3. Explanation of Action (Bartsch & Wellman, 1989)

The ﬁnal false-belief task used was an amalgam of the other two in which a
puppet is deceived. The child is shown a puppet which is then put to sleep out of
sight. While the puppet is away, the child is shown a familiar box, say of eggs,
and the eggs are removed from the container and hidden in another neutral box.
The puppet is then brought onto the scene and the child is told, “You know what
he likes to do when he wakes up? He likes to eat eggs!” The puppet is then made
to manipulate the (empty) egg box and the child is asked, “Why is he looking in
there?” and “Why isn’t he looking in that (other) box?” Mental explanations are
again not necessary for points on this task: saying, “because they were in there” is
coded as a satisfactory explanation.

The false-belief tasks each had a maximum score of 2, for a total of 6 each

round. The “passing” criterion was set at 5 or 6 correct out of 6 possible.1

4. Language tasks

4.1. Memory for complements in described mistakes

On each round, children received photographs or drawn pictures of brief stories
in which a character was described as making a mistake, telling a lie, or having a
false belief. The subject’s task was to report what the content of that mistake was.
Previous work had shown that children have difﬁculty in answering such questions
when the lower or embedded proposition is false (de Villiers, 1995a). This task
does not require the child to “read” the character’s state of mind, but merely to
represent it by holding the sentence in mind and then repeating the relevant piece
back. There were 12 such events, six of which involved acts of thinking (verbs
think and believe) and six involved acts of communication (verbs say and tell).
These were further subdivided such that for half of the events of each type, the
question asked for a report of the contents of the character’s belief/statement, for
example:

(9) He thought he found his ring, but (second picture) it was really a bottle

cap. What did he think? (Pointing back at ﬁrst picture.)

(10) She said she found a monster under her chair, but (second picture) it was
really the neighbor’s dog. What did she say? (Pointing back at ﬁrst picture.)

We scored this leniently, that is if a child answered “A monster!” we scored it
correct; we did not require the child to say, “that she found a monster.” Even the
minimal response reveals that children processed the complement structure in the
story. A response such as “a dog!” did not get a point.

1 Copies of all the additional stories are available from the authors on request.

1044

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

For the other half, the question asked for a report on the object of the character’s
believed or stated action, which required simply a noun rather than the whole
propositional content:

(11) This girl saw something funny at a tag sale and paid a dollar for it. She
thought it was a toy bird but (second picture) it was really a funny hat. What
did she think she bought? (Pointing back at ﬁrst picture.)

A response such as “hat” counted for 0 point, a response indicating “bird”
counted for 1 point. Memory for Complements had a total possible score of
12; criterion for passing was set at 10 or more out of 12. We derived two fur-
ther scores: Memory for Complements/mental verbs and Memory for Comple-
ments/communication verbs, using 5/6 as the criterion for passing each.

4.2. Spontaneous speech

In each round we collected and transcribed the spontaneous speech of the chil-
dren while they talked to us in the test sessions, played computer adventure games
with us, played with various toys, and after watching amusing silent videos when
they spontaneously offered their own experiences.

the grammatical

Spontaneous language was coded in several ways. We derived MLU scores, and
also derived a total IPSYN score (Scarborough, 1990), an index of the range and
complexity of
forms used. Within the IPSYN scoring
are several subtotals that we also derived for analysis, including the total Sen-
tence Score (IPSYN SS), the total complex sentences (IPSYN complex), the total
score for complements (IPSYN comps), and the total complex minus complements
(IPSYN-w/o-comps). In this way we could separate the critical feature, namely
sentential complements with mental/communication verbs, from other forms of
complex sentence that play no role in our theoretical argument, such as relative
clauses and if-then clauses.

5. Medial answers to wh-questions

Based on earlier work discussed above, we were also interested in studying
further the tendency of children to treat the medial wh-word as a question instead
of a complementizer in a question after a story such as:

This little girl went shopping one afternoon but she was very late going home. She
went a short way home over a fence but she ripped her dress on the wire. That night
when she was in bed she told her mom, “Look I ripped my dress this afternoon !”

When did the girl say what she ripped?

We had speculated that the stage at which children answer the medial might
represent a failure to appropriately subcategorize the complement under the verb.
For that purpose we used four such questions following stories in each round, and

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

1045

coded whether the child gave a correct answer:

(a) A short distance answer (when did she say it? — “that night”, or “when she

was in bed”).

or a wrong answer:

(b) A long distance answer (when did (she say) she ripped the dress — “that

afternoon”, “going home” or “when she was on the fence”).

(c) A medial answer (what did she rip? — “her dress”).

The child could get 4 points for answering each question with an answer such
as (a). We also recorded the error types, which were overwhelmingly type (c) as
in previous work.

6. Results

6.1. Coincident change over time

Fig. 1 shows the growth in percentage correct of each type of test item across
rounds. Given the variability in amount of spontaneous speech across rounds and
the resultant lack of comparability, we do not consider the spontaneous speech in-
dices on this graph. We separated the mental and communication verbs in the Mem-
ory for Complements task but collapsed across tokens within each type as there
were no signiﬁcant differences. Fig. 1 demonstrates that all these abilities change
and grow within the same time frame, with the average performance on both types
of Memory for Complements usually slightly higher than that on the false-belief
tasks, but the order of inﬂuence is not clear from such a pattern. What is also

Fig. 1. Percentage correct on each task at each round.

1046

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

evident is that the correct answers to the questions with a medial wh-complementizer
lag well behind the other language skills.

A word is in order about the measure of “Prediction”, namely, a verbal or
pointing answer to the question “where will X ﬁrst look for the Y?” in the unseen
displacement task. The graphs show this task always taking the lead in terms of
percentage correct. Leslie (1994) argued for a SEE control (where the character
sees the object moved) as a way to check the validity of the prediction measure: we
opted for a “Justiﬁed Prediction” measure instead. It is interesting to note that in
the ﬁgures, “Justiﬁed Prediction” falls squarely in line with the other false-belief
measures.

The data, however, must be analyzed more precisely to determine order of
effect in the relationship between complements and false beliefs. We contend that
mastery of the false-belief tasks has as a prerequisite that the child be able to
linguistically represent complements that are false. Children who fail false-belief
tasks, on the other hand, are still in the process of developing the ability to represent
complements. Fig. 2 shows the percentage of children who count as “passers” on
the Memory for Complements task and the set of false-belief tasks, on each round.
Again, there are always more “passers” on the syntax task than on false belief, at
each round.

6.2. Language measures

Before turning to the prediction concerning language and Theory of Mind de-
velopment, consider ﬁrst the inter-correlations among the language variables them-
selves.

There are several general language variables:

(1) MLU.
(2) The general IPSYN score (overall IPSYN).

(3) The IPSYN sentence score (IPSYN SS).
(4) The IPSYN complex sentence score (IPSYN complex).
(5) The IPSYN sentence score minus complements (IPSYN SS no comps).Then

there are four that speciﬁcally relate to complementation:

(6) The IPSYN score for complements (IPSYN comps).
(7) Memory for mental complements.
(8) Memory for communication complements.
(9) Wh-question: namely, correct short distance answers to wh-questions with

a medial wh-word.

Unfortunately the spontaneous output was sparse in Round 1, as the children
were new to us and the testing, so we had insufﬁcient data on which to calculate
reliable IPSYNs. Much richer language data emerged from Round 2. Table 1
shows the correlations among the language variables at this round, mostly high as
expected since all are indices of syntactic development.

A factor analysis on selected language variables 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 was per-
formed to conﬁrm that the measures tapping complementation had a commonality
not shared with the remaining more general language measures. The factor analysis
revealed the presence of two factors, the ﬁrst accounting for 49.3% of the variance,
the second for 23.2%. After Varimax rotation, the loading of the various language
measures on the two variables is revealed (see Table 2). Very clearly, the ﬁrst is com-
plementation, since Memory for Complements/communication verbs and Memory
for Complements/mental verbs are the highest factors, with IPSYN complements
also signiﬁcant on that factor. The second factor is most likely general language
skills, and MLU and IPSYN-w/o-complements load most heavily. Clearly this
more general factor is also contributing to performance on the wh-questions and
IPSYN complements, so while these tap complementation skill, they also reﬂect
more general language development.

6.3. Relations among the false-belief measures

Table 3 presents the correlations among the false-belief measures on each of the
three rounds. Note that the correlation between Prediction and Justiﬁed Prediction
is a trivial one, since they are yoked together at least partially. But here also
we see that Justiﬁed Prediction is a better correlate with the other tasks than is
Prediction alone. However, the false-belief tasks are not highly intercorrelated,
probably because the sample is relatively small and the measures themselves are
only 0, 1, 2 on each measure.

6.4. Relations among language measures and false-belief measures:
product-moment correlations

For this analysis we show in Table 4 the inter-correlations among perfor-
mance on the language measures and performance on the three false-belief tasks:

Unexpected Contents and Explanation of Action as well as the measures of Pre-
diction and Justiﬁed Prediction. Round 2 is chosen because that was when there
was the greatest variance on all tasks and the spontaneous language measures were
all adequately sampled.

The correlations in bold are signiﬁcant as shown. Although Table 1 revealed
that the language measures also intercorrelate quite highly, it is clear also that the
syntactic measures that tap complementation, Memory for Complements/mental
and Memory for Complements/communication, as well as the IPSYN score on
spontaneous complements (IPSYN comps) show a strong relationship to the var-
ious indices of false-belief performance. The measure of answering the correct
short distance wh-question did not show a strong relationship primarily because
so few children passed this task in Round 2. As mentioned previously, avoiding the
medial wh-question answer may require more than complementation. In contrast,
the measures of syntax that do not measure complementation, MLU and the more

general IPSYN scores, show a weaker realtionship to false-belief performance.
Out of the possible 12 correlations between clear complementation and false-belief
performance, 10 are statistically signiﬁcant and positive. The wh-measure fails on
all counts as a predictor. For the more general syntax measures that do not reﬂect
complementation, only 3 out of 24 correlations with false-belief performance reach
signiﬁcance.

It is important to note that the least verbal false-belief measure, namely
“Prediction” without justiﬁcation, is the most weakly correlated with the com-
plementation measures. We will return to this point later in the discussion. In
what follows, we take as our composite score of “passing” false belief, the scores
on Justiﬁed Prediction, Unexpected Contents (self and other) and Explanation of
Action.

6.5. Direction of effect: pass/fail contingencies

To test the direction of effect between language measures and false-belief mea-
sures, we conducted two separate kinds of analyses, one a categorical pass/fail
analysis and the other considering the measures as continuous variables. Consider
ﬁrst the categorical analysis. We set as criteria for passing false belief a score of 5 or
6 out of 6 on the composite across three task types. Essentially that decision makes
a categorical gap between a score of 4 and a score of 5, and considers all lower
scores equivalent. Likewise, on the Memory for Complements, we coded passing
as 10, 11 or 12 correct out of a possible 12. All scores below 10 are considered
“failing”. These are reasonably rigorous criteria by the binomial distribution.

Then we asked: do children always pass Memory for Complements before
false belief, but never vice versa? Table 5 shows the children who ﬁt the four
possible patterns across the three rounds: simultaneous fail, simultaneous pass,

pass false belief before Memory for Complements, pass Memory for Complements
before false belief. The appropriate test here is not chi-square, which tests only
contingency, but simply the likelihood of falling above or below the diagonal, i.e.,
13 in one direction and 5 in the other. A sign test on the difference is signiﬁcant
(P ≤ .05).

Consider these data in the light of the other measures we had on the children’s
language. For the Round 1 exceptions, one child “passed” false beliefs while only
achieving a score of 2/12 on the Memory for Complements task. Neither did this
child offer mental explanations in the false-belief tasks. However, he spontaneously
used complements structures in his speech, showing he had the hypothesized pre-
requisite structures. For instance, he said the following upon hearing music from
the room below:

“I think that’s my room making all that sound, ’cos we always make that music.”

The second exceptional child achieved a score of just 8/12 on Memory for
Complements, but produced in addition two fully formed mental explanations,
complete with mental verb and complement, as justiﬁcations for his prediction in
the Unseen Displacement task, as well as spontaneous evidence of complemen-
tation on the IPSYN. Therefore, he had control of the necessary syntax. Inter-
estingly, by Round 2 both of these children improved to 11/12 on Memory for
Complements. The third child achieved only 2/12 on Memory for Complements
but produced a spontaneous mental explanation with full syntactic complement in
the false-belief task and two further spontaneous complements as measured by the
IPSYN.

There are two further exceptions in Round 3. One child passed false belief while
failing Memory for Complements (7/12), though he gave one perfectly well-formed
mental explanation using a complement structure for the prediction on the Unseen
Displacement task. The second scored 1/12 on Memory for Complements, but pro-
vided evidence from IPSYN scoring of spontaneous well-formed complements. So
in every case, children who passed false beliefs gave us evidence that they had pro-
ductive command of complementation. The most reliable evidence seems to come
from the Memory for Complementation task, though it was not infallible in eliciting
the correct forms. In only 5 cases out of 84 predictions (28 subjects×3 rounds), did
we have to extend the evidence beyond that task to include spontaneous speech and
explanation. We examine the Memory for Complements task as a unique predictor
in the next analysis.

Of course, we realize the one-sidedness of this analysis, in that we had more
data to draw upon to support our language analysis than we had informal means of
assessing understanding theory of mind. That is, it could be argued that children
who showed no linguistic evidence of complements and failed our various tasks of
false belief, really understood other minds in everyday life. We must acknowledge
that this possibility remains open to future testing, and we are actively pursuing
more indirect ways to assess false-belief-understanding.

6.6. Hierarchical regression: partialling out general language ability

Which language measures predict a signiﬁcant percentage of variance in false
belief? Children who have, say, larger vocabularies or longer sentences, may have
advantages in following the cognitive demands of tasks. To avoid confounding
our speciﬁc claim with that of general linguistic advantage, we use a hierar-
chical regression to test which language measures contribute most strongly to
false-belief-understanding, given that all of the linguistic tasks are highly inter-
correlated. The theory predicts that the key to understanding false belief is mastery
of complementation, not overall length of utterance or other kinds of linguistic com-
plexity. We have contended that Memory for Complements is the most pertinent
and reliable measure of this mastery.

The factor analysis provided a way to divide the language variables. With the
dependent measure as false belief at Round 2, we ﬁrst entered as a block the
two general language measures for which there is no theoretical connection to
false-belief reasoning: MLU and IPSYN-without-complements. Those two vari-
ables accounted for an insigniﬁcant amount of variance (14.3%) as seen in Table 6.
We then entered as the second block two of the variables that relate to complemen-
tation: medial-wh answers, and IPSYN complements, and the variance accounted
for is signiﬁcant (35.3% ) as is the change in R2 (R2 = 20.9%, P ≤ .04). When
the theoretically most sensitive variable, Memory for Complements, is added, the
variance accounted for jumps to 47%, again a signiﬁcant change (R2 = 11.7%,
P ≤ .04). If we try reversing the order, entering Memory for Complements in
block 2, the variance accounted for is highly signiﬁcant (R2 = 44%, P ≤ .0025)
but entering the other two complement measures as block 3 adds no signiﬁcant
variance.

As a second, non-categorical approach to the question of direction of effect, we
considered the measures as continuous variables and ran regression analyses pre-
dicting future scores. Hierarchical multiple regressions were run with either false
belief (0–6) at Round 3 as the dependent variable, or Memory for Complements
syntax measure at Round 3 (0–12) as the dependent variable. So we contrast the
results of predicting false belief at Round 3 on the basis of the language mea-
sures at Round 2, with the results of the reverse scenario, predicting Memory for
Complements at Round 3 on the basis of Round 2 false-belief measures. With the
dependent measure as false belief at Round 3, we entered the Round 2 general
language measures MLU and IPSYN-w/o-complements, with no signiﬁcant result

(see Table 7). Adding the next two complement measures, neither the variance
(20%) nor the change in variance (3%) is signiﬁcant. Adding Memory for Com-
plements, however, creates a signiﬁcant change in the variance (R2 = 13%,
P ≤ .048). Dividing Memory for Complements into its component verb types:
communication and mental verbs (score 0–6 on each), a further regression reveals
that if Memory for Complements/communication verbs is added as block 2, that
creates a signiﬁcant R2 change over the general language measures (R2 = 13%,
P ≤ .044), and then adding Memory for Complements/mental verbs at Step 3 adds
nothing signiﬁcant to the equation (Table 8). If Memory for Complements/mental
verbs is entered at block 2, no signiﬁcant results emerge.

With the dependent measure set instead as Memory for Complements at Round
3, the three component false-belief tasks — Unexpected Contents, Justiﬁed Pre-
diction and Explanation of Action — at Round 2 were used as predictor variables.
There is no signiﬁcant variance accounted for by the false-belief measures at Round
2 on this measure of syntax at Round 3. As a further test, we used as the dependent
measure the spontaneous IPSYN complements measure from Round 3, but once
again found no signiﬁcant variance accounted for by the false-belief measures at
Round 2. Taking the false-belief measures from Round 2 as a composite score
(0–6) instead, this also results in no signiﬁcant prediction of complement mastery
at Round 3.

Taken together, this set of results reveal that the language measures pertaining to
complementation, and speciﬁcally the Memory for Complements measure, predict

an important determinant of false-belief performance rather than vice versa. It is
also signiﬁcant that it is mastery of complements with communication verbs that
seems to be the core development, because the shared variance is not therefore
simply attributable to the semantic content of lexical items such as “thinks” or
“knows”.

By choosing the composite measure of false belief as we did, there is a risk that
we have built into our tasks the requirement of complex language. Here we have
endeavored to show that

(i) the justiﬁcations and explanations we require for passing false belief do NOT
need linguistic complementation overtly, i.e., if a child says “because he put
it there,” we count that as an adequate reason and

(ii) the language measures that predict false-belief reasoning are not general lin-
guistic sophistication but speciﬁc to command of complements, with com-
plements using communication verbs being as adequate if not more so, than
complements using mental verbs.

The least linguistically demanding task is the unseen displacement task using
“Prediction”, and in Round 2 the language measures did not correlate well with
that measure. If “Prediction” is in fact leading the way in false-belief reasoning,
i.e., children can predict before they can give a reason or explain, the possibility
arises that they can do this without command of complementation. To check the
possibility that Prediction is independent of the speciﬁc language requirement, we
performed one further simple regression, to see if Prediction (without necessar-
ily justiﬁcation) at Round 2 could be predicted by Memory for Complements at
Round 1. We chose Rounds 1 and 2 for this lagged regression rather than Rounds
2 and 3 because there is essentially no variance in Prediction by Round 3 (see
Fig. 1). Both Memory for Complements/communication and Memory for Com-
plements/mental at Round 1 are signiﬁcant predictors of Prediction in Round 2
(R2 = 21.9%; P ≤ .05; see Table 9). However in this case we are not able
to make a deﬁnitive case for directionality. Round 1 Prediction scores also pre-
dict Round 2 Memory for Complements (R2 = 24.3%, F = 8.3, P ≤ .05; see
Table 10).

Consider again the relationships predicted to hold between language of com-
plementation and false-belief-understanding. We wish to argue that the child needs
the full syntax of mental verbs plus sentential complements in order to represent
in his own mind the belief states of other people, not simply to encode them for
reporting about them in speech. The present data do not conclusively decide this
question, but they are compatible with such a claim. Other work, for example with
severely language-delayed deaf children, offers corroboration (de Villiers & de
Villiers, 2000).

But what would the child be able to talk about in such language forms if he
didn’t yet have an understanding of false beliefs? One possibility we argued is
that he could use exactly such structures for talking about communication events,
since communication verbs can also take true or false tensed complements. The
child could then bootstrap his way to a full mastery of mental verbs and comple-
ments via communication verbs and their complements. This proposal was made in
de Villiers (1995a, 1995b) where a full staged model of how complements might
be acquired was outlined. In that model, the child who hears communication verbs
and complements, for example:

(12) She said she washed her hands

can check their meaning against the occasional overt evidence available in the
environment, speciﬁcally that the speaker in question said “I washed my hands” and
didn’t wash them. This is important in learning the possibility that such structures
permit false complements — a property unique to complements but not to adjunct
clauses. In the case of mental verbs, there is no overt evidence of thinking, so
making appropriate inferences about the meaning of a sentence such as:

(13) She thought she washed her hands

is bound to be more difﬁcult. We have no direct evidence in this study of earlier
mastery of communication verbs, so this remains only a theoretical possibility. In
the Memory for Complements task, half were communication verbs and half were
mental verbs, but the task described both events in identical terms and there was
no direct speech evidence to give advantage to the communication verbs, so it is
not the ideal condition for such a test. Instead, the Memory for Complements task

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

1057

merely required the child to form the correct syntactic representation that would
allow a computation of the appropriately embedded answer. No inferences of any
sort concerning mental states were required, but the syntactic representation had
to be available. The regression does suggest that at Round 2, the analysis that the
subjects gave to the communication verbs was a better index of their mastery than
that for the mental verbs, at least in so far as their performance on that set predicted
how they did in the false-belief tasks later.

Within contemporary linguistic theory, there are adherents to the view that all
syntactic structures are available to children from the start, as part of Universal
Grammar (Crain, 1991; Fodor, 1975; Hyams, 1986; Wexler, 1990). Hence mis-
takes in interpreting complementation would be seen as performance or processing
errors rather than stages of incomplete grammatical representation. This discus-
sion would take us beyond the bounds of the current paper, and a commitment to
either a representational or a linguistic processing deﬁcit is not strictly necessary
for the present argument. The point here is that a child who fails to retain the
appropriate syntactic representation for a complement construction will not have
it available as a form of mediating representation for false-belief-understanding. If
false-belief-understanding depends on such a representation, the child will then fail
false-belief tasks. Our data above conﬁrm this prediction. Furthermore, we demon-
strate that mastery of complement structures is the best predictor of false-belief
performance, and the latter is not just a function of higher overall language ability
such as MLU or skill at variety of syntactic forms other than complementation.

But, if we argue that command of complementation is a prerequisite for suc-
cess on false belief, why did the spontaneous speech measure of complements not
contribute to the prediction of false belief in the regression? The primary reason is
that complements were relatively rare in the spontaneous speech, thus the measure
was confounded with opportunity in a way that the elicited measure (Memory
for Complements out of 12 possible occasions) was not. With more effort at de-
signing situations to elicit talk about either communication or mental states, the
contribution of spontaneous speech could be more adequately assessed.

However, it is important to notice that the effect here is likely to be bi-directional,
namely, understanding mental states undoubtedly makes it more probable and
easier for the child to encode events in terms of people’s beliefs, motives, intentions,
emotions and so forth. Hence the spontaneous speech measure is just as likely to
be affected by achieving false-belief success as it is to affect it. All spontaneous
and elicited use of mental state terms is subject to choice, and does not necessarily
tap what the child can do.

It is also important to note that we are not claiming that all Theory of Mind un-
derstanding depends on mastery of these sophisticated linguistic representations.
Obviously, the young child has begun mastering aspects of Theory of Mind un-
derstanding that are precursors to false belief: reading intentions from eye gaze
and pointing (Baldwin, 1991, 1993; Baron-Cohen, 1991; Tomasello, 1995), un-
derstanding other’s desires (Gopnik, 1993) and the separation of pretence from
reality (Leslie, 1987). It is also possible that an implicit expectation of how

1058

J.G. de Villiers, J.E. Pyers / Cognitive Development 17 (2002) 1037–1060

another individual will act based on their previous attentional focus could emerge
prior to an explicit reasoning about action based on false beliefs (in children,
Clements and Perner, 1994; in tamarin monkeys, Hauser, 1999). Without such pre-
cursors, it is possible that the linguistic representations would be useless (though
see Tager-Flusberg (2000) for a counter-argument). Instead, we wish to argue that
mastery of the linguistic structures bridges the two strands of development, the
grammatical developments that encode events, and the understanding of others’
behavior and the construction of a theory about it. The structural achievement of
complements in language provides a representation for encoding false beliefs: with
this representation the child can build the explicit theory on which such reasoning
depends.

Having achieved an explicit representation of false beliefs and the contents of
other minds, the use of that theory in reporting and explaining actions proliferates,
adding a new dimension to the child’s understanding of stories and of ordinary
human interactions. This understanding in turn results in an increase in the spon-
taneous use of mental verbs and complements. Mastery of Complementation is
thus a classic example of a “keystone” — it is the connecting stone between two
arches that completes the design and supports the structures above.
