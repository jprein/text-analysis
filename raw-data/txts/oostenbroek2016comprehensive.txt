In Brief
Oostenbroek et al. carried out the largest-
ever longitudinal study of neonatal
imitation in humans. Newborns were
shown a variety of gestures at four time
points and found to be just as likely to
produce matching and non-matching
actions in response. The results
challenge claims that imitation is an
innate human capacity evident at birth.

SUMMARY

Human children copy others’ actions with high ﬁdel-
ity, supporting early cultural learning and assisting in
the development and maintenance of behavioral tra-
ditions [1]. Imitation has long been assumed to occur
from birth [2–4], with inﬂuential theories (e.g., [5–7])
placing an innate imitation module at the foundation
of social cognition (potentially underpinned by a
mirror neuron system [8, 9]). Yet, the very phenome-
non of neonatal imitation has remained controversial.
Empirical support is mixed and interpretations are
varied [10–16], potentially because previous investi-
gations have relied heavily on cross-sectional de-
signs with relatively small samples and with limited
controls [17, 18]. Here, we report surprising results
from the most comprehensive longitudinal study of
neonatal
imitation to date. We presented infants
(n = 106) with nine social and two non-social models
and scored their responses at 1, 3, 6, and 9 weeks of
age. Longitudinal analyses indicated that the infants
did not imitate any of the models, as they were just as
likely to produce the gestures in response to control
models as they were to matching models. Previous
positive ﬁndings were replicated in limited cross-
sections of the data, but the overall analyses con-
ﬁrmed these ﬁndings to be mere artifacts of
restricted comparison conditions. Our results under-
mine the idea of an innate imitation module and sug-
gest that earlier studies reporting neonatal imitation
were methodologically limited.

RESULTS

With approval by the University of Queensland’s Behavioural and
Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee, our study was de-
signed to chart the prevalence, time course, and social-cognitive
correlates of neonatal
imitation using a large sample and a
comprehensive longitudinal design. Infants (n = 106) were pre-
sented with 11 models for 60 s each when the infants were 1,
3, 6, and 9 weeks of age. These models (see Figure 1) included

four facial gestures (tongue protrusion, mouth opening, happy
face, and sad face), two non-social objects simulating the facial
gestures (a spoon protruding through a tube and a box opening),
two hand gestures (index ﬁnger protrusion and grasping), and
three vocal gestures (‘‘mmm,’’ ‘‘eee,’’ and ‘‘click’’ sounds). We
scored the number of times the infants displayed each of the
nine facial, hand, and vocal gestures when viewing the models
(see Table S1 for coding guidelines and inter-rater reliabilities).
Unlike in other studies of neonatal imitation, this allowed us to
compare the frequency of infants’ behavior that matched the
model with the frequencies of that same behavior in response
to ten different control models. Imitation would be evident if
matching responses (e.g., infant makes tongue protrusions while
viewing a tongue protrusion model) were more frequent than
non-matching responses (e.g., infant makes tongue protrusions
while viewing a happy face model). We excluded from analyses
all infants who were sleeping or crying during a testing session,
resulting in a ﬁnal sample of 64 infants for the longitudinal tests
and a range of 77–90 infants for the cross-sectional tests (see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for further details).

For each gesture we ran a series of generalized linear mixed
model (GLMM) analyses. The dependent variable for each series
of GLMMs was the number of responses produced by the infants
averaged over four 15-s trial periods for each gesture modeled.
The ﬁxed predictors of infant behavior included (1) the gesture
modeled by the experimenter (i.e., the matching gesture or one
of the ten control gestures), (2) the age of the infant at the time
of testing, and (3) the interaction of the previous two predictors
(to account for any change in imitation over time). These full
GLMMs were tested against simpler nested GLMMs: gesture
and age only without the interaction term, gesture only, age
only, and a null model containing no ﬁxed effects (see Supple-
mental Experimental Procedures for more details and justiﬁca-
tion of these statistical analyses and also for details of the model
selection process for each gesture).

Contrary to expectations, the longitudinal analyses failed to
uncover any evidence for imitation of any of the nine social
gestures (see Figure 2). Speciﬁcally, for three gestures (mouth
opening, sad face, and eee sound), there were no differences be-
tween the frequencies of the gestures in response to the match-
ing models versus the control models and no changes in the fre-
quencies of the gestures over time. For three other gestures
(index ﬁnger protrusion, grasping, and click sound), the infants’
likelihood of producing the gestures changed linearly over

Figure 1. Gestures Modelled to Infants
(A–H) Gestures modeled to infants in imitation testing: tongue protrusion (A), mouth opening (B), happy facial expression (C), sad facial expression (D), index ﬁnger
protrusion (E), grasping (F), tube protrusion (G), and box opening (H). Not represented are the three vocal gestures: mmm, eee, and click sounds. See Table S1 for
coding guidelines and inter-rater reliabilities.

time, but the type of model was not an informative predictor of
their behavior. For the ﬁnal three gestures (tongue protrusion,
happy face, and mmm sound), both time and model (but not their
interaction) were predictors. However, although the infants pro-
duced these gestures signiﬁcantly more often when the model
demonstrated them than when she demonstrated some control
gestures, there were no signiﬁcant differences when compared
to other control gestures (see Table 1). These null results were
evident even before applying Bonferroni corrections to control
for familywise error rate (comprehensive longitudinal results
are reproduced in Tables S2 and S3).

Since tongue protrusion has produced the most consistent ev-
idence for neonatal imitation in the literature [14, 19], we present
a separate detailed summary of this gesture across conditions in
Figure 3. At each time point, only about half of the infants
(46.7%–64.2%) produced any tongue protrusions in response
to the tongue protrusion model (see Figure S4), and there was
no sign of intra-individual consistency of such responses (i.e.,
response frequency correlations across the four time periods
ranged from  .08 to 0.28). More of the control comparisons for
tongue protrusion were signiﬁcant than for any other gesture
(see Table 1). Yet, across time points, the frequency of infant
tongue protrusion responses to the tongue protrusion model
did not signiﬁcantly differ from the frequencies of such re-
sponses to the mouth opening, happy face, and sad face
models. Thus, there is no evidence infants were imitating the
speciﬁc model. One may speculate about whether active faces
in general may trigger a tongue protrusion response, but this
begs the question of why infants did not respond in a similar
manner to the vocal gestures.

The overall longitudinal results contradict previous reports of
neonatal imitation. Nonetheless, our data do indeed replicate
key cross-sectional ﬁndings, while conﬁrming these results
to be artifacts of
restricted comparison conditions. When
we used the most common cross-sectional procedure of
comparing infants’
tongue protrusions in response to the
tongue protrusion model with their tongue protrusions to the
single control model of mouth opening [2], for example, we
found that infants were signiﬁcantly more likely to produce
matching responses than non-matching responses at 1 week,
t(73) = 2.25, p = 0.028 (n = 74), and 9 weeks of age, t(88) =
3.24, p = 0.002 (n = 89). This need not mean that the infants
imitated the tongue protrusion model at these ages, however,
as the effect does not hold across all control comparisons.
When we used the happy face as the control model,
for
instance, there were no signiﬁcant cross-sectional effects at
any age, all t < 1.62, p > .11. More broadly, across nine ges-
tures and four time points (36 total cross-sections of data),
there were 14 occasions on which the infants produced the
gesture matching the model signiﬁcantly more often than to
at least one control model. On no occasion, however, did the
infants produce the gesture matching the model signiﬁcantly
more often than to all control models, even without applying
Bonferroni corrections (see Table S4). Since there is no widely
accepted a priori reason to choose one control model over
another, even our cross-sectional results do not provide any
evidence for a true imitation effect. Yet, if we had obtained or
analyzed a less comprehensive dataset (as has been done in
previous studies), then we may have been impelled to conclude
otherwise.

DISCUSSION

Given the methodological strengths of the current study com-
pared to previous studies [18], our results suggest that the
many prominent theories built upon the assumption of neonatal
imitation (e.g., [5–7]) are not empirically supported and should
be modiﬁed or abandoned altogether. To continue defending
the phenomenon in light of our ﬁndings would require the non-
parsimonious and empirically intractable assumption that infants
produce the same amounts of certain gestures (e.g., tongue pro-
trusions, happy faces, and mmm sounds) to matching and non-
matching models for different reasons (imitative and non-imita-
tive). Previous studies reporting imitative effects appear to have
been limited by inadequate controls and analyses, and/or the

presence of outliers in small cross-sectional samples of infants.
A few studies reporting null results like ours can be found in the
literature [17], but many more may have been ﬁled away due to
publication bias [20, 21].

If neonates do not imitate, as our results suggest, then the
age of ﬁrst emergence for the phenomenon may actually be
closer to 6 to 8 months of age [22]—around the time that Pia-
get [23] classically proposed. Such a developmental trajec-
tory would challenge the idea of a specialized, nativist module
for imitation [2, 5] and would instead favor the view of imita-
tion as an emergent product of both native and environmental
inﬂuences [14, 19, 24, 25]. One key driver of the nativist ac-
count was the discovery of mirror neurons in the macaque
monkey [26], but it remains unclear whether these neurons

are an innate adaptation for imitation and action understand-
ing [8, 9] or a by-product of associative learning [27, 28]. Our
results provide evidence against the innate view, and they
also bring into question ﬁndings suggesting that macaques
and other non-human primates engage in neonatal
imitation
[29, 30].

In summary, our comprehensive longitudinal study, contrary to
expectations [18], has failed to uncover any evidence for imita-
tion in human neonates. Instead, the results challenge the exis-
tence of this long-debated phenomenon and prompt revision
of a number of inﬂuential theories placing it at the foundation
of social cognition.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Subjects
Participants included 106 healthy infants (51 girls, 55 boys). The infants were
tested at four longitudinal time points when aged approximately 1, 3, 6, and
9 weeks (mean [M] = 1 week, 4 days, SD = 2.49 days; M = 3 weeks, 4 days,
SD = 3.06 days; M = 6 weeks, 2 days, SD = 2.96 days; M = 9 weeks, 3 days,
SD = 4.42 days). All parents/guardians gave informed consent for their children
to participate, as approved by the human ethics committee of the University of
Queensland.

Materials and Methods
At each time point, infants were presented with 11 modeled actions (in one of
ﬁve orders), including four facial gestures (tongue protrusion, mouth opening,

tures (a spoon protruding through a tube and a box opening), two hand ges-
tures (index ﬁnger protrusion and grasping), and three vocal gestures (mmm,
eee, and click sounds). Following previous work [2], the experimenter ﬁrst
modeled the relevant action for 15 s (ﬁve times at 3-s intervals) before
engaging in a passive position for 15 s. This process was then repeated
such that the infants saw 30 total seconds of active modeling during each
1-min trial. All sessions were videotaped and infants’ responses were coded
by two scorers, one blind to the aims of the study (see Table S1 for coding
guidelines). These coders scored the total number of each of the nine social
gestures produced by the infants toward each of the 11 models, with these
gesture frequencies then averaged over each 15-s trial period in which the in-
fants were in a suitable arousal state for testing. Approximately 20% of the
videos were coded by both scorers, with good levels of inter-rater reliability
for all nine gestures (see Table S1). Comprehensive methodological details
can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
