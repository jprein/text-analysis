Role taking. The measure of role taking, or social perspective taking,

byFlavel(1968)andSelman(SelmanandByrne,1974).Flavel'sprocedure wasabinary-choicesocialguesinggamein-whichthesubjecttrickedan-

Thus the role taking behavior changes ovar a one: year period and per-
formance on measures of role taking altruism, and conservation was higher in 10-year-old subjects than in 7-year-old subjects. In the earlier stUdy (Ianoti,Notes1and2),significantpositiveagediferencesbetwen6-
and 9-year-old subjects were found for role taking, altruism, and situa- tionalmatching.Asignificantdecreaseinperformancebetwen6-and9- year-old subjects was found,for emotional matching. The present study shows continued age difTerences for role taking and altruism but not for the measures of empathy. These results, particularly the one-year longitudinal changesinroletaking,suporttheextensiveresearchwhichshowsthat6 to 10 years of age is a time of rapid changes in social cognition. The in- creased reliance on situational cues in the empathy measure may be due to the increase in perspective-taking ability and the subsequent realization
that emotional cues may be faked while situational cues are more reliable. RelaLionshipbetwenvariables.Thecorelationaldatawerealitle
