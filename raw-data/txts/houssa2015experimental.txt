Abstract 

In an experimental design, we examined the effects of middle-term training in social information processing (SIP) and 
in Theory of Mind (ToM) on preschoolers‟ social cognition and social adjustment.   

48 preschoolers took part in a pre-test and post-test session involving cognitive, socio-cognitive and social adjustment 
(direct  and  indirect)  measures.  They  were  allocated  at  random  to  an  experimental  group  (subgroups  of  4  children 
attended 15 45-minute sessions in which they received ToM and SIP training using educational materials) or a  control 
group (free play sessions).   

The  results  showed  that  each  group  improved  in  direct  measures  of  social  cognition.  The  experimental  group  was 
significantly  better  at  the  SIP  task  in  post-test  than  the  control  group.  Significant  correlations  were  obtained  between 
individual  and  family  characteristics  and  direct  measures.  Furthermore,  regression  analyses  showed  that,  after 
controlling  for  pre-test  result,  SIP  measures  in  post-test  were  significantly  predicted  by  pre-test  results  and  group 
condition.   

This study could help professionals and parents by providing them with some basis for early training exercises that can 
induce an improvement in SIP competences in preschoolers.

1. Introduction 

Social  adjustment  of  preschoolers  and  prevention  of  externalizing  behavior  (EB)  disorders  are  matters  of  some 
importance in mental health and education. Identifying risks of social maladjustment and EB as soon as possible and 
intervening  adequately  could  help  children  to  adapt  to  different  environments;  that  is,  encouraging  better  social 
adjustment  could  be  useful  before  primary  school  entry.  In  the  present  study,  we  tested  the  effects  of  middle-term 
experimental  training  on  the  level  of  social  cognition  competences  in  preschoolers.  Furthermore,  we  examined  the 
potential impact of this training on their social adjustment. 

In  developmental  psychology,  several  models  have  emerged  to  explain  social  adjustment  difficulties  in  children. 
Amongst them, the Social Information Processing (SIP) and Theory of Mind (ToM) models may offer a suitable basis 
for explaining the development of social competences or accounting for possible social difficulties in children. 

Preschoolers understand some mental states such as emotions, beliefs, desires, and intentions, and are able to infer the 
mental states of others (Deneault & Ricard, 2013; Wellman, 1991). Children gradually become able to recognize desires 
and emotional expressions, to predict emotions according to social situations, to predict social behavior according to felt 
emotions (corresponding to „affective‟ mental states), but also to adopt the visual perspective of others, to understand 
their beliefs and false beliefs (corresponding to „cognitive‟ mental states). According to the Vygotskian ToM conception, 
sharing knowledge and explanations about mental states can help children‟s development of ToM (Astington, 1996).   

The  more  children  gain  an  understanding  of  positive  and  negative  emotions,  the  better  adapted  their  social  behavior 
becomes (see notably, Deneault & Ricard, 2013; Denham et al., 2003). In at-risk children, deficits in ToM are reported 
in  the  recognition  of  emotions  (Blair  &  Coles,  2000),  but  also  in  the  understanding  of  causes  and  consequences  of 
emotions (Hughes, Dunn, & White, 1998) and of beliefs (Fahie & Symons, 2003; Walker, 2005). Finally, we know that 
deficits in the recognition of mental states could be responsible for social adjustment difficulties  (Deneault & Ricard, 
2013; Eisenberg et al., 1997) because of bias in the way children perceive social situations.

In  addition,  Crick  and  Dodge  (1994)  have  developed  a  functional  SIP  model  to  explain  how  children  cognitively 
process critical social situations (i.e. provocation, ambiguity, conflict) and how they solve social problems. In a social 
situation, six steps are mobilized: they encode other people‟s social cues (a), interpret social cues (b), clarify goals (c), 
access  possible  responses  or  build  a  response  (d),  make  a  response  decision  (e)  and  enact  the  behavior  (f)  (Crick  & 
Dodge, 1994), 

In  children  with  –  or  at-risk  of  developing  –  EB  disorders  or  social  adjustment  difficulties,  deficits  are  postulated  in 
each of the six steps of SIP (Crick & Dodge, 1994; Dodge & Crick, 1990; Dodge & Pettit, 2003) and these get worse 
with  time  (Dodge et al., 2003).  Consequently,  in  these children,  deficits in  social problem solving are also postulated 
(Pettit, Dodge, & Brown, 1988) because they have difficulties in spotting relevant social cues and in judging whether or 
not other people‟s social behavior is appropriate.   

As aggressive children with distorted SIP  (Crick & Dodge, 1996) are regularly rejected by their peers,  they have less 
opportunity for positive social interactions. Conversely, children using SIP appropriately are able to interact easily with 
peers, display prosocial behavior and are then able to be socially accepted by others (Yeates et al., 2007). 

What  are  the  main  features  and  effects  of  training  programs  in  social  cognition?  Several  authors  have  devised 
short-term training and middle-term or long-term intervention programs in social cognition competences. Studies have 
reported  an  improvement  in  children‟s  competence  in  ToM  „emotions‟  (Walker,  2005)  and  in  ToM  „beliefs‟  after 
short-term training in small groups (Appleton & Reddy, 1996; Howlin, Baron-Cohen, & Hadwin, 2011) (see a detailed 
review in Houssa, Nader-Grosbois, & Jacobs, 2014). In general, these studies involved only one mental state (emotion 
or belief).   

The authors of PATHS (Domitrovich, Cortes, & Greenberg, 2007), Strong Kids (Merrell, Juskelis, Tran, & Buchanan, 
2008), EBP (Izard et al., 2008), Incredible Years (Webster-Stratton & Reid, 2008), KITS (Pears, Fisher, & Bronz, 2007), 
ICPS (Shure & Spivack, 1982), Second Step (Frey, Hirschstein, & Guzzo, 2000), but also Bhavnagri and Samuels (1996) 
and  Ornaghi,  Brockmeier,  and  Grazzani  (2014)  have  emphasized  the  effectiveness  of  middle-term  or  long-term 
interventions for preschoolers. Such interventions have combined various targets (emotional regulation, social problem 
solving,  emotion  comprehension,  prevent  EB  disorders,  etc.).  Studies  have  been  conducted  with  typically  developing 
preschoolers  (Bhavnagri  &  Samuels,  1996;  Domitrovich  et  al.,  2007;  Frey  et  al.,  2000;  Ornaghi  et  al.,  2014),  at-risk 
preschoolers (Izard et al., 2008; Merrell et al., 2008), and preschoolers with EB disorders (Pears et al., 2007; Shure & 
Spivack, 1982; Webster-Stratton & Reid, 2008). 

Several  methodological  factors  of  those  programs  favor  effective  training  in  social  cognition  for  preschoolers.  When 
understanding  of  emotions  and  beliefs  are  investigated,  the  techniques  are:  social  interactions  and  communication 
through  language  about  emotions,  beliefs,  false  beliefs,  etc;  explanation  of  the  correct  responses;  differentiated 
immediate feedback; asking for a justification; conversations after reading illustrated scenarios; repetition of the task; 
etc. For social problem solving abilities, the techniques are: identification of emotional and social cues; social problem 
solving;  discussion  about  critical  social  situations;  corrective  feedback;  production  of  alternative  solutions  in  critical 
social situations; etc. 

The  most  widely  used  techniques  are  the  generalization  of  concepts  and  immediate  feedback,  which  appear  to  be 
effective. The most relevant point about the materials used is their wide variety (videos, pictures, books, puppets, music, 
etc.).   

There is disparity in terms of some methodological aspects across programs. Firstly, the trainer‟s status varies: sessions 
have  been  administered  by  teachers  (Domitrovich  et  al.,  2007;  Izard  et  al.,  2008;  Webster-Stratton  &  Reid,  2008), 
teachers or parents (Frey et al., 2000; Shure & Spivack, 1982), experimenter (Ornaghi et al., 2014; Pears et al., 2007) or 
teacher  and  experimenter  (Bhavnagri  &  Samuels,  1996;  Merrell  et  al.,  2008).  Secondly,  to  measure  the  effect, 
researchers have used several instruments for emotions, social problem solving, EB and social adjustment. For example, 
Pears  et  al.  (2007)  only  used  other-reported  measures,  while  others  have  only  applied  direct  measures  through  tests 
(Bhavnagri & Samuels, 1996). A further group of researchers have combined both methods of assessment (Domitrovich 
et al., 2007; Izard et al., 2008; Shure & Spivack, 1982). The CBCL (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) is the most widely 
used other-reported measure of EB. 

Effects are observed in direct as well as other-reported measures. Some programs merely showed behavioral stability in 
the  experimental  group,  while  the  control  group  deteriorated  (Pears  et  al.,  2007).  Others  (e.g.  Izard  et  al.,  2008) 
generated a significant decrease in maladapted behaviors. An improvement in SIP was obtained after a training program 
including stories of peer interactions (Bhavnagri & Samuels, 1996). 

There is also disparity in group size: from groups of three children (e.g. Pears et al., 2007) to an entire class (e.g. Izard 
et al., 2008). The duration and the timing of training sessions are different: from 15 sessions bi-weekly (e.g. Ornaghi et

Journal of Education and Training Studies                                                                                                      Vol. 4, No. 1; January 2016 

al.,  2014)  to  30  sessions  during  30  weeks  (e.g.  Bhavnagri  &  Samuels,  1996).  Despite  the  variation  in  several 
methodological aspects, the literature shows that children‟s abilities are efficiently improved.   

However, to our knowledge, no study has ever investigated the effect of middle-term training combining ToM and SIP 
models.  Moreover,  authors  who  provided  training  in  emotional  competences  did  not  take  into  account  other  mental 
states  which  are  more  cognitive.  In  addition,  the  targets  of  these  programs  were  general:  they  aimed  for  not  only  an 
improvement  of  social  and  cognitive  competences,  but  also  a  broader  set  of  targets  (such  as  academic  competences, 
inhibition,  adjustment  at  school  or  language).  Furthermore,  in  terms  of  inter-individual  variability  in  children,  these 
studies did not take into account personality factors or verbal and non-verbal intellectual level. 

In  a  previous  study,  Houssa  and  colleagues  (2014)  examined  the  differentiated  effects  of  two  one-shot  SIP  and  ToM 
training sessions on preschoolers. After one training session, they  found some transfer effect (the ToM training group 
improved in ToM „emotions‟ and in SIP and the SIP training group improved  in  ToM „beliefs‟ and in SIP). Based on 
these results, and on the programs reported above, we know that social cognition abilities are „trainable‟ in preschoolers 
and that these processes potentially interact with each other.   

In  the  present  study,  we  decided  to  implement  a  middle-term  intervention  to  allow  an  impact  on  social  adjustment, 
rejecting a long term intervention in order to prevent interference from other factors. 

We predicted  that  (1a)  children  who  benefited  from  training  would  have  significantly  better  competence  in  ToM  (i.e. 
affective and cognitive mental states) and SIP (i.e. social problem solving). A positive effect (1b) for social adjustment 
was also expected.   

The  second  objective  was  to  explore  links  between  ToM,  SIP  abilities  and  adults‟  perception  of  children‟s  social 
adjustment  and  EB  in  the  pre-test  session,  taking  individual  characteristics  into  account.  We  predicted  positive  links 
between  ToM  and  SIP  abilities  and  chronological  age  (CA),  intellectual  quotient  (IQ)  (2a)  and  specific  factors  of 
personality  (2b)  and  also  between  social  cognition  and  social  adjustment  (2c).  Finally,  we  hypothesized  some  links 
between several variables and EB. A positive link between CA and EB, a negative link between social cognition and EB, 
and  links  between  the  five  factors  of  personality  and  EB  were  expected  (2d).  Regression  analyses  helped  to  explore 
these links. 

2. Method   

2.1 Participants 

The participants were 48 children (13 boys and 35 girls). They were between 4 years and 5 years and 4 months old (M 
age = 55.7 months, SD = 4.4 months). The level of education of mothers was indicated on a seven-point scale from low 
(elementary  school  not  completed)  to  high  (university),  with  a  mean  of  4.98  (SD  =  1.51)  (5  corresponded  to  „short 
higher  education‟);  for  fathers,  the  mean  was  4.32  (SD  =  1.65)  (4  was  equivalent  to  „apprenticeship  contract‟).  The 
families‟ monthly income was indicated on a nine-point scale from low (0-500 euros) to high (4000 euros or more), and 
the mean was 5.98 (SD = 1.97), corresponding to 2500-3000 euros a month.   

Participants  were  recruited  in  French-speaking  Belgian  schools.  Children  were  excluded  if  parents  and  teachers  had 
ever reported problems with their behavior (our inclusion criterion was a score below 21 at the CBCL–corresponding to 
„normal‟  level;  Achenbach  &  Rescorla,  2000),  or  in  the  case  of  developmental  delay  or  intellectual  disabilities. 
Information letters and consent forms were sent to parents. 

2.2 Procedure 

For the pre-test, three different tests were administered: four subscales of the WPPSI-III, ToM Task Battery and RES. 
Total administration time was approximately 60 minutes. Children were tested individually at school in a quiet room. 
Parents completed the ToMI, the EASE and the CBCL, and teachers completed the CBCL and the EBMCF. For the EB 
variable (CBCL), we took the mean of parents‟ and teachers‟ versions. 

Then, children were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 24) or to the control group (n = 24). In groups of 4, 
children  participated  in  15  45-minute  sessions  held  twice-weekly  at  school.  Sessions  were  administered  by  two 
experimenters.   

Finally,  children  were  assessed  in  a  post-test  using  the  ToM  Task  Battery  and  RES.  Again,  parents  completed  some 
questionnaires (EASE and ToMI). As personality was regarded as stable, the EBMCF was not completed in post-test. 
Because of the school holidays, there were approximately 5 months between pre- and post-test. 

2.3 Instruments 

2.3.1 Measures of Individual Characteristics   

Wechsler Intelligence Scales – third edition (Weschler, 2004) 

 

63 

Journal of Education and Training Studies                                                                                                      Vol. 4, No. 1; January 2016 

These scales were used in pre-test session to exclude possible mental retardation. They distinguish between verbal and 
non-verbal  IQ.  Verbal  IQ  is  obtained  by  means  of  scores  on  two  scales:  “information”  and  “verbal  reasoning”. 
Performance IQ is obtained by means of the “matrix” and “block design” scales. The mean of each scale is 10, with a 
standard deviation of 3. We included children with a global score between 5.5 and 14.5 (1.5 SD). This global score was 
the mean of the four subscales. 

Bipolar Rating Scales based on the Five Factor Model (EBMCF, Roskam, De Maere-Gaudissart, & Vandenplas-Holper, 
2000) 

This questionnaire measures children‟s personality. It includes 25 items; five factors of personality for each factor in the 
model (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness). The factor analysis revealed 
the 5 expected factors, for which  Cronbach‟s  alpha was between .70  and .93.  Coefficients of test-retest stability were 
highly significant (Roskam et al., 2000). 

Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL, Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) 

The CBCL includes items  to assess behavioral and emotional problems  in  children. In this study, we only used items 
related  to  EB  to  ensure  that  children  were  not  too  high  on  the  EB  scale.  The  „Aggressive  behavior‟  subscale  and  the 
„Attention problems‟ subscale from the CBCL were summed to determine the „Externalizing behavior‟ score. Internal 
consistency (α = .63 - .86) and test-retest reliability (r = .85) were satisfactory.   

2.3.2 Measures of Theory of Mind 

Theory of Mind Task Battery (Hutchins, Prelock, & Chace, 2008) 

The ToM Task Battery is composed of 15 test questions in 9 tasks. This test evaluates separate mental states but also the 
combination of mental states (e.g., desire-based emotion, perception-based belief, second-order false belief). This test 
was validated through test-retest reliability, internal consistency and external correlation (Nader-Grosbois & Houssa, in 
preparation). 

Theory  of  Mind  Inventory  –  French  version  (ToMI,  Hutchins,  Prelock,  &  Bonazinga,  2012)  (translated  by  Houssa, 
Mazzone, & Nader-Grosbois, 2014) 

It  measures  caregivers‟  perceptions  of  children‟s  ToM  abilities.  The  ToMI  is  designed  to  identify  caregivers‟ 
impressions of children‟s thoughts and feelings. It consists of 39 statements ranges from 0 to 20. Internal consistency (α 
= .94) and test-retest reliability (r = .86) are high (Houssa, Mazzone, et al., 2014). 

2.3.3 Measure of Social Information Processing 

Social problem solving task (RES, Barisnikov, Van der Linden, & Hippolyte, 2004) 

This  task  is  used  to  assess  SIP  competences,  i.e.to  estimate  the  capacity  of  children  to  judge  whether  or  not  other 
people‟s social behavior is appropriate, and to determine the extent to which their judgment is based on a knowledge of 
conventional and/or moral rules. This task consists of showing 14 items (five appropriate and nine inappropriate social 
behaviors). Firstly, the child is asked whether the social behavior is appropriate or inappropriate; the maximum score is 
28  points  (judgment  score).  The  second  question  assesses  the  identification  of  the  target  behavior.  The  child  has  to 
identify what is good or not in the picture; the maximum score is 14 (identification score). Finally, the third question 
(reasoning  score)  estimates  the  extent  to  which  the  judgment  is  justified  by  reference  to  social  rules.  Three  levels  of 
response  are  proposed  for  this  question,  corresponding  to  the  award  of  2,  5,  and  7  points  respectively.  First,  the 
descriptive level corresponds to a description of the situation. Second, the inter-subjective level reflects a position linked 
to social consciousness, but limited to an understanding of concrete aspects of the situation. Third, the conceptual level 
reflects  social  consciousness,  a  reference  to  social  rules,  and  generalization.  No  points  are  given  if  a  justification  is 
inappropriate or not given. The maximum score for this third question is 98 and 140 for three questions. The inter-judge 
agreement was 98% congruent (Hippolyte, Iglesias, Van der Linden, & Barisnikov, 2010). 

2.3.4 Measure of Social Adjustment   

Social adjustment scales (EASE, Hughes, Soares-Boucaud, Hochman, & Frith, 1997) 

The  EASE  is  a  measure  of  adults‟  perceptions  of  children‟s  socio-emotional  adjustment  competencies  in  daily  life.  It 
includes items relating to social competencies (non-ToM), but also items relating to children‟s mentalization capacities 
and perspective-taking abilities (ToM). For each item, caregivers/teachers have to indicate if the behavior is usual for 
their  children.  The  two  subscales  had  good  internal  consistency:  Cronbach‟s  alpha  was  .77  for  the  “ToM  subscale”, 
and .79 for the “No ToM subscale”. 

2.4 Training Sessions 

In  the  experimental  group,  children  received  training  in  SIP  and  ToM  competences.  Sessions  were  constructed  with

Journal of Education and Training Studies                                                                                                      Vol. 4, No. 1; January 2016 

reference to a theoretical background and on the basis of a hierarchical progression (from simple to complex abilities). 
The first 7 sessions dealt with ToM competences; the 7 following sessions dealt with SIP competences; the final session 
integrated all of the concepts. An appendix presents the objectives, activities and the techniques used. 

The  first  basis  for  the  training  was  the  program  of  Howlin  and  colleagues  (2011).  It  establishes  a  progression  in  the 
understanding  of  mental  states.  The  levels  for  emotions  are:  (a)  photographic  facial  recognition,  (b)  schematic  facial 
recognition,  (c)  situation-based  emotions,  (d)  desire-based  emotions,  and  (e)  belief-based  emotions.  For  beliefs,  the 
levels  are:  (a)  simple  perspective  taking,  (b)  complex  perspective  taking,  (c)  seeing  leads  to  knowing,  (d)  true 
belief/action prediction, and (e) false belief (Hadwin, Baron-Cohen, Howlin, & Hill, 1996). 

The second basis was the six steps of the SIP model (Crick & Dodge, 1994): (a) encoding other people‟s social cues, (b) 
interpretation  of  social  cues,  (c)  clarification  of  goals,  (d)  response  access,  (e)  response  decision,  (f)  behavioral 
enactment. 

The third inspiration was the hierarchical levels of justification distinguished by Barisnikov et al. (2004) in the RES: (a) 
descriptive  level  (description  of  facts),  (b)  intersubjective  level  (position  linked  to  social  consciousness),  and  (c) 
conceptual level (make reference to a social rule or convention). On the basis of the child‟s level assessed by means of 
RES  in  pretest,  the  experimenter  tries  to  elicit  a  more  complex  level  of  justification,  by  using  the  proximal  zone  of 
development conceptualized by Vygotsky (1978). 

Children worked in groups because, as some researchers have recently suggested (e.g. Houssa, Nader-Grosbois, et al., 
2014; Lecce, Bianco, Devine, Hughes, & Banerjee, 2014; Ornaghi et al., 2014), they were able to help each other by 
completing each other‟s answers or correcting them, inducing socio-cognitive conflict which might help them with their 
thinking and highlighting the existence of various points of view on the same social situations. Furthermore, a speaking 
slot was applied. 

The activities involved included sequences of play, pictures, video extracts, handling of objects, puppets, story reading, 
etc. Each session ended with a story dealing with an emotion, with a false belief or a social problem solving situation. 
Reading stories to children and talking about the protagonists‟ mental states and emotions seems to increase their social 
cognition level (Bhavnagri & Samuels, 1996; Ornaghi et al., 2014).   

Different types of material were included in each session, to ensure that they were adapted to the children‟s individual 
styles  of  perceptive  and  socio-perceptive  processing,  selective  attention  capacity,  cognitive  inhibition  attention,  and 
fatigue and were able to stimulate their interest. This variety of materials can help children to generalize and apply what 
they have learned in new situations. 

Open-ended questions were asked to induce conversations, and feedback was provided as well as an explanation of the 
correct  or  expected  response.  Correct  answers  led  to  positive  feedback,  while  incorrect  answers  elicited  explanations 
about  the  correct  response  (differentiated  immediate  feedback).  To  promote  the  generalization  of  concepts,  the 
experimenter  reminded  the  general  principle  related  to  the  task  (such  as  the  social  rules  that  could  be  applied  in  this 
social situation).   

The  control  children  participated  in  groups  in  15  45-minute  free  play  sessions  to  control  the  familiarity  effect  of  the 
experimenter. The experimenter avoided addressing SIP and ToM concepts. 

3. Results 

First, independent sample t-tests were conducted to check the equivalence between groups in pre-test. Then, to measure 
the  effectiveness  of  the  intervention,  a  repeated  measure  ANOVA  was  conducted  on  each  measure  with  pre-  and 
post-test  scores  as  a  within-group  factor  and  groups  as  a  between-participants  factor.  After  that,  intercorrelations  in 
pre-test  were  tested.  Finally,  we  conducted  multiple  regression  analyses  to  examine  which  variables  contributed  to 
children‟s social cognition and social adjustment.   

3.1 Between Group Comparisons on Pre-test 

Table  1  presents  means  and  standard  deviations  for  all  variables  in  the  pre-test  session  for  the  control  and  the 
experimental group. Independent sample t-tests revealed no significant difference between groups. The groups could be 
considered  as  equivalent  in  pre-test  except  for  one  family  characteristic:  mothers  in  the  experimental  group  had  a 
significantly lower level of education than mothers in the control group. 

3.2 Effect of the Intervention 

3.2.1 Theory of Mind   

As Table 1 shows, a repeated measure ANOVA revealed no significant pre/post-test effect for the ToM measures. Paired 
sample t-tests showed a pre/post-test effect in the experimental group for the ToM Task Battery, t(23) = 2.83, p = .001,

but also in the control group, t (23) = 3.79, p = .01. Concerning the ToMI, paired sample t-tests revealed a pre/post-test 
effect in both groups; t(23) = 4.51, p = .046 for the experimental group and t(23) = 2.12, p = .00 in the control group.   

3.2.2 Social Information Processing 

A  repeated  measure  ANOVA  showed  significant  time  by  group  interactions  on  the  SIP  measure  in  favor  of  the 
experimental group. This interaction is significant for the RES total (F(1,23) = 8.54, p = .005, η²
p = .16), for Question 3 
of  the  RES  (F(1,23)  = 9.10,  p  =  .004,  η²
p =  .17),  and for  two  levels of justification  (wrong/no  justification:  F(1,23)  = 
16.59, p = .00, η²

p = .27 and inter-subjective level: F(1,23) = 4.01, p = .051, η²

p = .08).   

Significant  group  by  time  interactions  were  further  analyzed  by  paired  sample  t-tests.  Concerning  the  RES  total,  the 
experimental group significantly improved between pre- and post-test, t(23) = 11.77, p = .00, which was also the case 
for the control group, t(23) = 5.20, p = .00. For Question 3 of the RES, the experimental group significantly improved 
between pre- and post-test, t(23) = 10.98, p = .00, which was also the case for the control group, t(23) = 4.77, p = .00. 
Then, for the percentage of wrong answers/no justification, there were also significant improvements between pre- and 
post-test for the experimental group, t(23) = -8.35, p = .00, and the control group, t(23) = 3.37, p = .003. Finally, for the 
percentage  of  the  intersubjective  level,  there  was  also  significant  improvement  between  pre-  and  post-test  for  the 
experimental group, t(23) = -7.70, p = .00, and the control group, t(23) = 4.03, p = .001. 

3.2.3 Social Adjustment   

A repeated measure ANOVA reveals no significant pre/post-test effect for the social adjustment measures. Nonetheless, 
paired  sample  t-tests  showed  a  pre/post-test  effect  in  the  experimental  group  for  the  EASE  non-ToM,  t(23)  =  2.04,  p 
= .05, which was not the case for the control group, t(23) = .51, p = .61. 

3.3 Intercorrelations in Pre-test 

Table  2  presents  intercorrelations  between  some  pre-test  variables.  CA  correlates  negatively  and  significantly  with 
„consciousness‟, „openness‟, and „agreeableness‟ and positively and significantly with RES scores. The IQ is positively 
linked to „openness‟, „agreeableness‟, and „extraversion‟, to the ToM Task Battery, to the EASE, to family income and 
to fathers‟ education level. „Extraversion‟ is significantly and positively correlated with the ToMI. EB is negatively and 
significantly correlated with „consciousness‟, „openness‟, „agreeableness‟ and „emotional stability‟. Social adjustment is 
positively linked to ToM Task Battery and ToMI, and family characteristics.   

3.4 Multiple Regression Analyses 

To  investigate  the  extent  to  which  individual  characteristics  and  group  condition  contribute  to  children‟s  social 
cognition and social adjustment, a hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted. In Model 1, pre-test results 
were entered so that this variable was controlled; in Model 2, pre-test results and individual characteristics (CA, IQ and 
personality  factors)  were  entered;  in  Model  3,  pre-test  results,  individual  characteristics  and  group  condition  were 
entered.   

As shown in Table 3, distinct independent predictors explained scores on social cognition measures. After controlling 
for pre-test result in ToM Task Battery and ToMI (Model 1), predictors entered in Models 2 and 3 were non-significant. 
After accounting for the pre-test result in RES (Model 1), the RES in post-test was predicted by Model 3 (24% of the 
variance). It is important  to note that pre-test result in  RES  and group condition are the only variables which  made  a 
contribution.  After  controlling  for  the  pre-test  result  in  social  adjustment,  Model  2  (CA  and  personality  factors) 
accounted  for  25%  of  the  variance.  For  social  adjustment,  the  variables  which  contribute  in  Model  2  were  pre-test 
results,  CA,  agreeableness  and  extraversion.  Predictors  entered  in  the  last  model  were  non-significant  for  social 
adjustment.

4. Discussion 

As  predicted  (1a),  this  study  demonstrates  some  positive  effects  of  middle-term  training  in  social  cognition  (as  for 
example  Ornaghi  et  al.,  2014;  Shure  &  Spivack,  1982;  Webster-Stratton  &  Reid,  2008).  As  Houssa  and  colleagues 
(2014) reported about a one-shot training session, training that involves feedback and explanations improved children‟s 
performances  in  social cognition. With regard to  repeated measures analyses,  the only significant  difference concerns 
performances  in  social  problem  solving  in  favor  of  the  experimental  group.  This  could  be  due  to  the  fact  that  SIP 
sessions  were  more  effective  than  ToM  sessions,  but  also  because  ToM  sessions  were  given  in  the  first  part  of  the 
training.  These  results  could  also  be  due  to  the  children‟s  spontaneous  development  in  both  groups  (there  were 
approximately 5 months between pre- and post-test). 

Like  some  authors  (Begeer  et  al.,  2011)  who  found  no  strong  evidence  for  the  effectiveness  of  ToM  training  on 
mind-reading skills, we failed to find any significant difference in the ToM Task Battery score. However, those authors 
found effects in some ToM skills (conceptual ToM skills) only (with 8-13-year-old children), which was not the case in 
our study, probably due to the age difference.   

These different effects between ToM and SIP variables could be interpreted with reference to the different underlying 
theoretical  models.  The  RES  refers  to  the  SIP  model,  proposing  a  functional  approach  to  social  problem  solving, 
whereas  the  ToM  Task  Battery  is  founded  on  the  ToM  model,  which  takes  a  developmental  approach  to  the 
comprehension of mental states, which is seen as a lengthy process. As mentioned earlier, children may have benefited 
more from one part of the social cognition training than from another. 

For the social problem solving, each step of the SIP model was covered during training sessions. Our training sessions 
led to improvements in several steps of the SIP model. For instance, in pre-test, children tended to justify their answers 
at  a  descriptive  level,  or  produced  a  wrong/no  answer.  In  post-test,  the  trained  children  provided  fewer  wrong/no 
answers  and  more  intersubjective  explanations.  It  shows  that  this  intervention  allowed  children  to  improve  their 
competences  in  social  reasoning  by  taking  a  position  linked  to  their  better  social  awareness,  as  suggested  by 
Lachavanne  and  Barisnikov  (2013).  Probably  because  the  conceptual  level  of  justification  generally  emerges  later  in 
development (Lachavanne & Barisnikov, 2013), the trained children used hardly any conceptual justification in the RES. 
In preschoolers, focusing training sessions on the intersubjective level is effective because it matches children‟s zone of 
proximal development. 

Concerning  the  social  adjustment  measure  (1b),  the  trained  group  showed  a  significant  difference  between  pre-  and 
post-test for one scale of social adjustment (EASE non-ToM). Children who received training in social cognition were 
perceived  as  having  better  social  skills  and  as  adhering  more  closely  to  social  rules  in  daily  life.  Such  results  are 
consistent with observations made by other authors (e.g. Domitrovich et al., 2007; Shure & Spivack, 1982) who have 
reported  an  increase  in  social  adjustment  after  training.  Training  in  small  groups  fosters  social  relationships  and 
adaptive interpersonal skills (Lachavanne & Barisnikov, 2013). 

The present study supports previous findings showing correlations among social cognition variables, social adjustment, 
some  factors  of  personality  and  EB  scores  (Nader-Grosbois,  Houssa,  &  Mazzone,  2013).  Positive  correlations  were 
obtained between social cognition measures. As Hutchins and colleagues (2012) found, ToM Task Battery and ToMI are 
positively  correlated,  meaning  that  the  better  children‟s  competences  in  solving  ToM  tasks,  the  more  their  parents 
perceive them as having good ToM abilities in daily life situations (and vice versa). 

As predicted (2a), several individual characteristics were significantly linked with social cognition or social adjustment 
measures. As children grow older, they acquire competences in social cognition. The higher children‟s IQ is, the more 
positive  their  parents‟  perception  of  their  social  adjustment.  In  particular,  ToM  Task  Battery  was  correlated  with  IQ, 
whereas  the  RES  was  correlated  with  CA. However,  the  indirect  measure  ToMI did not  correlate with  CA  or IQ. We 
also observed a significant positive correlation between IQ and social adjustment. This means that, as children increased 
their IQ through real-life experience, caregivers perceived them as better socially adjusted. 

As hypothesized (2b), the  more children were perceived as being extroverted, the  more they were perceived  as being 
socially adapted (and vice versa) (Meunier et al., 2011). 

As  predicted  (2c),  positive  and  significant  correlations  were  obtained  between  ToM  Task  Battery,  ToMI  and  social 
adjustment.  This  means  that  the  better  children  performed  in  ToM,  the  more  they  were  perceived  as  socially  well 
adapted  by  their  parents  (and  vice  versa)  (Denham  &  Burton,  2003;  Houssa,  Nader-Grosbois,  et  al.,  2014; 
Nader-Grosbois  et al., 2013). Contrary to what was expected (2d), we did not observe any correlation between social 
cognition measures and CA and EB. This could be due to the fact that the inter-individual variability in CBCL was low

in typically developing preschoolers; it could be different in children diagnosed as presenting EB disorders. Finally, as 
in  previous  studies,  significant  correlations  were  found between  EB  and four  personality  factors  (2d)  (Meunier  et al., 
2011; Prinzie et al., 2003). These correlations mean that children were perceived as having more EB when they were 
perceived as being less conscious, open, agreeable and emotionally stable. 

Multiple  regression  analyses  showed  that  the  training  had  no  significant  effect  on  post-test  performance  for  ToM 
measures. This result was congruent with previous analyses. In the SIP measure, we showed that group condition was a 
significant  predictor  of  the  post-test  result.  This  means  that  the  training  had  an  effect  on  performance,  because 
experimental  group  improved  significantly  more  than  control  group.  Again,  this  result  allows  us  to  conclude  that  the 
training  is  effective  in  improving  SIP  abilities.  However,  individual  characteristics  did  not  influence  the  post-test 
performance.  This  means  that  different  profiles  of  children  were  receptive  to  training  sessions.  Finally,  concerning 
social  adjustment,  several  personality  factors  had  some  impact  on  post-test  results.  Teachers‟  perception  of  children‟s 
extraversion and agreeableness predicted parents‟ perception of children‟s social adjustment.   

5. Implications for Research and Intervention 

In  summary,  as  Houssa  and  colleagues  (2014)  showed,  the  pre-  and  post-test  batteries  differentiated  between 
socio-cognitive  profiles  accurately  and  could  be  used  to  detect  weaknesses  in  preschoolers  and  to  better  understand 
social (mal)adjustment. This study could help professionals and parents by providing them some basis for early training 
exercises  that  can  induce  an  improvement  in  SIP  competences  in  preschoolers.  One  limitation  of  the  present  study  is 
that we should have taken measures at the middle of the intervention, to test the potential effect on ToM measures, after 
ToM sessions. We decided not to do this in order to avoid a learning effect or familiarity effect related to ToM tasks in 
children,  which  might  have  introduced  a  bias  in  performance  or  a  decreasing  of  motivation  in  the  post-test.  To 
counteract, we should have reversed the order of ToM and SIP sessions for half of groups. 

Further  studies  are  needed  to  compare  different  samples  of  atypical  children,  in  order  to  test  whether  improvements 
after social cognition training are similar. It could be relevant to test this training in EB children, in order to determine 
whether it is possible to reduce their social cognition difficulties and their EB and to increase their social adjustment.
