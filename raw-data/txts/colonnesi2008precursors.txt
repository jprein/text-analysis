The study examined whether the pointing gesture and intentional understanding
abilities at 12 and 15 months of age predict the later understanding of perception and
intention, as well as the ability to explain others’ actions in a psychological way at 39
months of age. Thirty-ﬁve infants (18 girls) were administered pointing and intention-
understanding tasks at the age of 12 and 15 months. Children were again evaluated at
the age of 39 months with perception and intention tasks, and a psychological
explanation task. Results showed that only 12-month-olds’ comprehension of the
pointing gesture with an imperative motive contributed to the prediction of later
understanding of perception and mentalistic explanations of actions. Moreover, the
ability of 12- and 15-month-olds to understand intentions contributed to the prediction
of later preschool understanding of perceptions and intentions. These results indicate
that a developmental trajectory in children’s understanding of mental states from
infancy to childhood is present, but depends on the level of engagement and
communication that are required to perform these tasks.

Over the last 10 years, theory of mind research has been increasingly directed towards
its earlier development during the ﬁrst 2 years of life, aiming to ﬁnd a developmental
progression from infancy to childhood. Many socio-cognitive abilities in the second year
of life could set the base for theory of mind development (Carpenter, Nagell, &
Tomasello, 1998; Tomasello, Carpenter, Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005). Two of these are
joint attention behaviour (Carpendale & Lewis, 2006 for a review) and understanding of
others’ intentions (Meltzoff, 1995). In this study, we will consider to what extent these
two features in infancy might contribute to children’s later theory-of-mind functioning.

An important joint attention behaviour is the pointing gesture in production and in
comprehension (Carpendale & Lewis, 2006; Carpenter et al., 1998). Production of the
pointing gesture is the simultaneous extension of the arm and index ﬁnger towards a
target and aims to direct the attention and behaviour of another person to an object or
event. It emerges between the end of the ﬁrst and the beginning of the second year of
life, in a period during which communication switches from a preverbal form to
conventional language (Bates, Benigni, Bretherton, Camaioni, & Volterra, 1979). It is
considered an act of intentional communication because it is produced in order to direct
the attention and behaviour of another person to an object or event and to communicate
about it (Bates et al., 1979). Understanding pointing produced by someone else shows
that children direct their attention towards an object or event at which another person
is pointing, which indicates that they are able to understand that the other person wants
them to orient
their attention towards a speciﬁc target (Camaioni, Perucchini,
Bellagamba, & Colonnesi, 2004).

The pointing gesture may be produced with an imperative or a declarative motive.
Pointing with an imperative motive is produced to direct the attention of somebody
towards an object in order to request it or to ask for an action towards it. Pointing with a
declarative motive can be produced to direct someone’s attention towards an event or
an object of interest in order to share interest (Camaioni, 1997). More recently, two
subtypes of declarative pointing have been distinguished (Tomasello, Carpenter, &
Liszkowski, 2007). The ﬁrst is declarative pointing as expressive in which the infant
shares an attitude with an adult about a common referent (consistent with the original
deﬁnition of declarative pointing). The second is declarative pointing as informative in
which the infant provides the adult with needed or desirable information about some
reference. However, both expressive and informative pointing gestures are produced in
order to direct another person’s attention and interest towards a speciﬁc event or
object. Consequently, they are still both included into the main category of ‘declaration’.
In sum, it is possible to distinguish four speciﬁc abilities related to the pointing gesture:
imperative comprehension; imperative production; declarative comprehension; and
declarative production.

With respect to pointing production, it is generally thought that declarative but not
imperative production will be a theory of mind precursor (Baron-Cohen, 1991;
Camaioni, 1997; Tomasello et al., 2005). There are two main arguments that give rise to
this assumption. First, declarative pointing seems to require understanding of the other
person as ‘intentional agent’ and the aim is to direct attention and to share experiences
(Camaioni, 1997; Legerstee & Barillas, 2003; Liszkowski, Carpenter, Henning, Striano,
& Tomasello, 2004), whereas imperative pointing only requires understanding of the
other person as ‘agent of action’ and it is aimed at inﬂuencing others’ behaviour. Second,
children with autism show impairments in the production of declarative gesture but not
in imperative gesture (Baron-Cohen, 1989; Charman et al., 1997).

The situation is less clear about typically developing infants’ comprehension of
pointing gestures with imperative and declarative motives. Infants’ general ability to
understand or to follow pointing gestures has been investigated (Behne, Carpenter, &
Tomasello, 2005; Carpenter et al., 1998), but a more speciﬁc empirical evidence is still
lacking about the motive of the gesture (imperative vs. declarative). It seems reasonable
to assume that the understanding of both imperative and declarative pointing gestures
require seeing the other person as an intentional agent. In fact, to understand
declarative pointing you have to appreciate that the other person is interested in
something and that this person tries to direct your attention. The same understanding is

involved in the appreciation of imperative pointing. In addition, the understanding of a
pointing gesture with an imperative motive also requires the comprehension that the
other person has a desire and that this person tries to direct your behaviour. For this
reason, imperative comprehension might be a stronger candidate as a theory of mind
precursor. To date, however, empirical evidence in this respect is not yet available. One
aim of the present study was to examine the extent to which the four named pointing
abilities in 12- and 15-month-olds contribute to the prediction of later theory of mind
understanding.

is thought

Another ability that

to contribute to children’s theory of mind
development concerns their understanding of intention. In the ﬁrst year of life children
are already able to distinguish between people and inanimate objects ( Woodward,
1998). In the beginning of their second year of life, children can distinguish between
intentional and unintentional actions (Carpenter, Akhtar, & Tomasello, 1998), recognize
that actions are purposive and goal directed (Phillips, Wellman, & Spelke, 2002), and are
able to attribute intentions and desires to people (Meltzoff, 1995; Repacholi, 1998;
Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997). Carpenter et al. (1998) investigated 14- and 18-month-olds’
understandings of intentional and accidental actions, using an imitation task. Infants
witnessed an adult performing some two-action sequences with objects. One action was
vocally marked as intentional with the expression ‘There!’ and the other was marked as
accidental with the expression, ‘Woops!’ Infants imitated the intentional action instead
of the accidental action, which indicates that they were able to differentiate between
the two types of actions, and that they were able to reproduce what the adult was trying
to do, not the objective behaviour that was actually performed.

Meltzoff (1995) showed that children of 18 months of age are able to understand the
intentions of a person who is trying but failing to perform certain target actions on an
object. Children observed an adult trying to perform a speciﬁc action with a toy, who
repeatedly failed in his attempt. Afterwards, the adult handed the toy to the child. The
children’s task was to understand the actor’s intention and produce the action that the
adult had been trying to perform rather than imitate the failed attempt. In total, 80% of
the children demonstrated the ability to reproduce what the adult intended to do, even
though the adult’s attempts failed. This result supports the idea that children see the
adult as a source of information about what to do with the object, and the adult’s
behaviour (failed attempt) gives information about the adult’s intentions. In the second
experiment, children’s reaction to the same action performed by a person versus an
inanimate object was evaluated.

Bellagamba and Tomasello (1999) and Olineck and Poulin-Dubois (2005) indicate
that the ability to understand others’ intentional actions develops between 12 and 18
months of age. Camaioni et al. (2004) examined the relationship between infants’
understanding of intentions and their ability to produce and understand the pointing
gesture with imperative and declarative intention. Children were observed at 12 and 15
months of age. Results showed that at both ages (12 and 15 months) children with high
intention understanding produced more declarative pointing than children with low
intention understanding. Thus, a concurrent association between these two abilities
was found. Indeed, when children are able to interpret a person’s actions within a
psychological framework involving goals and intentions, they also seem able to share
interesting aspects of the world with others and to inﬂuence other people’s attentional
states towards the world.

One could expect preschool children’s understanding of mental states, such as
to derive from the early ability to

understand others’ actions as intentional and to communicate in an intentional way.
A possible way to verify this hypothesis is to use a longitudinal design to examine
whether these abilities during infancy are indeed predictors for later childhood mental
states understanding. Only a few studies show relationships between children’s abilities
in the ﬁrst two years of life and the understanding of mental states during childhood
(Charman et al., 2000; Olineck & Poulin-Dubois, 2005; Wellman, Phillips, Dunphy-Lelii,
& LaLonde, 2004).

Charman et al. (2000) probably conducted the ﬁrst longitudinal study on joint
attention, imitation, and play during infancy as precursors to language and theory of
mind during childhood. In this study, a sample of 13 children, aged 20 months, was
administered a spontaneous-play task, two joint-attention tasks, and an imitation task.
The ﬁrst joint-attention task was the ‘active toy task’ in which a series of mechanical toys
were shown to induce an ambiguous response. The number of times the infant
produced a gaze switch between the toy and the adult (the parent or the experimenter)
was examined. The second joint-attention task was the ‘goal detection task’ with two
conditions. In the ﬁrst condition (the blocking task), while the infant was playing with a
speciﬁc toy the experimenter blocked the child’s hands for 5 seconds preventing the
child from further activity. In the second condition (the teasing task), the experimenter
offered the child a toy but immediately held it out of reach for 5 seconds, The number of
times that infants looked at the experimenter during the period of 5 seconds was
recorded. After 2 years, these children were presented with another set of tasks: a Level
1 visual perspective-taking task, a ‘seeing-leads-to-knowing’ task, and a situation- and
desire-based emotion task. At both time points, non-verbal abilities were measured. The
results revealed an association between the early joint-attention abilities and later
theory-of-mind understanding. This ﬁnding emphasizes the important theoretical role of
joint attention in the development of understanding of mental states.

Wellman et al. (2004) examined whether recognition of actions as purposive and goal
directed at 14 months of age could predict theory-of-mind understanding at the age of 51
months. Results showed that infants’ decrement of attention to displays of intentional
action predicted later social cognition, even when verbal intelligence was controlled for.
More recently, Olineck and Poulin-Dubois (2005) found that intention understanding at
14 and 18 months of age contributed to the prediction of children’s internal state
language at 30 months. Despite the large gap between the ﬁrst and the second
observation (about 2 years), these three studies give empirical evidence of a relationship
between children’s socio-cognitive abilities during infancy and their later theory of
mind understanding. At present, there are no studies examining the longitudinal
relation of the various pointing gestures and intention understanding in the second
year of life with the emergence of theory of mind capacities during preschool age.

The main aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between two
abilities, the pointing gesture and intention understanding, at the age of 12 and 15
months and children’s understanding of mental states at 39 months of age. In order to
examine the individual differences between children, all abilities that were included in
this study were examined in the period of their emergence. In fact, the pointing gesture
and the understanding of intentional actions develop between 11 and 16 months of age
(Bellagamba & Tomasello, 1999; Carpenter et al., 1998), and at the age of 3 years
children start to explain and predict others’ mental states ( Wellman & Liu, 2004).

The study is part of a bigger project about the precursors of a theory of mind. Part of
the present project has already examined the relationship between the pointing gesture
and intention during infancy (Camaioni et al., 2004), the change from 12 to 15 months

of age in children’s understanding of others’ intentional actions (Bellagamba, Camaioni,
& Colonnesi, 2006), and the relationship between children’s use of psychological
explanations and their understanding of perception and intention at the age of 3 years
(Colonnesi, Koops, & Meerum Terwogt, 2008). The abilities examined during infancy
were the comprehension and production of the pointing gesture with imperative and
declarative motives, and the understanding of intentional actions using the behavioural
re-enactment procedure of Meltzoff (1995). Three abilities were chosen as theory
of mind indices at the age of 39 months: perception understanding;
intention
understanding; and children’s ability to explain others’ actions in terms of mental states.
Previous ﬁndings led us to expect a longitudinal association between the socio-
cognitive abilities examined in the second year of life and the later understanding of
mental states (Charman et al., 2000; Olineck & Poulin-Dubois, 2005; Wellman et al.,
2004). However, different relationships were expected between different abilities. Both
pointing and intention understanding require the appreciation of other people as
independent agents possessing intentionality (Camaioni et al., 2004). However, only
through the production and the comprehension of
the pointing gesture the
intentionality is shared by the child and the adult in a communicative way (Tomasello
et al., 2007). Due to this strong communicative aspect, we expected to ﬁnd a stronger
relationship between the pointing gesture and the later use of psychological
explanation than between the pointing gesture and the understanding of intention.

Differently, the task we used to measure the intention understanding during infancy
has a strong perceptual and behavioural component, but lacks a strong communicative
component. The tasks we used to measure perception and the intention understanding
at the age of 39 months share the same characteristics. Therefore, we expected this
ability to have a stronger relation to the later understanding of perception and intention
than to the later use of psychological explanations.

In addition, both abilities that were examined during infancy were expected to have a
relationship with children’s later perception understanding since this capacity implies
basic theory of mind-understanding. Because the pointing gesture predicts later language
abilities (Desrochers, Morissette, & Ricard, 1995; Mundy & Gomez, 1998), and theory of
mind performances often correlate with language (Ruffman, Slade, Rowlandson,
Rumsey, & Garnham, 2003), children’s receptive vocabulary was controlled for.

Method
Participants
Thirty-ﬁve children participated in the study (18 females, 17 males). Children’s mean age
at the ﬁrst observation was 11.24 months (SD 1.5; range 9–14), at the second
observation was 14.24 months (SD 1.5; range 12–17), and at the third observation was
38.22 months (SD 0.2; range 38–40). Nineteen children were ﬁrstborn (54%) and 16
(46%) secondborn. Children were recruited through day-care centres and paedia-
tricians’ ofﬁces and were all healthy and developing normally. They all lived in the city of
Rome and came from middle-high socio-economic backgrounds.

Design
Infants were selected through the QPOINT questionnaire (Perucchini & Camaioni,
1999). The QPOINT questionnaire is a parent-report measure of the production of

imperative and declarative pointing. Parents received the questionnaire when their
infant was about 7 months old. They were asked to report as soon as their infant started
using the pointing gesture and send the questionnaire back to the university. Parents
were then contacted by telephone and invited to take part in the experiment with their
children about a week after the parent had ﬁlled in the questionnaire (ﬁrst observation).
After 3 months the observation was repeated (second observation). Parents were again
contacted by telephone when children were about 36 months old. They were asked to
allow the experimenter to visit the child at home for a last observation (third
observation).

Measurements at 12 and 15 months of age
The ﬁrst and the second observations were carried out in a laboratory room of
the Department of Social and Developmental Psychology of the University of Rome
‘La Sapienza’. Children were tested while seated on the parent’s lap, in front of a
rectangular table. All the observations were videotaped. The laboratory was equipped
with two cameras that were remotely controlled from a dark room located behind a one-
way mirror. Two research assistants, both women, served as experimenters. Each
observation started with a warming-up period until the child seemed acclimatized to the
room and the experimenters. Two tasks were administered: a pointing task and an
intention-understanding task.

Pointing task
This task comprises four experimental conditions designed to elicit four speciﬁc abilities
related to the pointing gesture: imperative comprehension; imperative production;
declarative comprehension; and declarative production. The task measures children’s
pointing abilities in an experimental setting. The procedure of the task is exhaustively
described in Camaioni et al. (2004). Each condition had eight trials with two different
stimuli, the ﬁrst four trials with one stimulus and the last four trials with the other
stimulus. Each trial was scored 1 when the child produced the target behaviour, so the
score range was 0–8 in each condition. Target behaviours in the four conditions were
coded as follows:

A two-step coding procedure was adopted for both the production and the
comprehension of the pointing gesture. Pointing production was coded as intentionally
communicative, ﬁrst, and then as imperative or declarative. Following Franco and
Butterworth (1996), any stimulus-directed pointing gesture produced by the child was
coded as intentionally communicative when looking at the experimenter’s face
occurred within 2 seconds before or after pointing, or when pointing and looking at the
experimenter’s face occurred simultaneously. The communicative intent – imperative or
declarative – of the child’s pointing gesture was coded according to the following
operational deﬁnitions.

. Imperative production: the child produced a pointing gesture and in addition at
. Declarative production: the child produced a pointing gesture and in addition

least one of the following behaviours: a request gesture; leaning forward or
reaching for the stimulus; producing a request vocalization or pointing to the
stimulus repeatedly.

at least one of the following behaviours: looking to the adult and smiling

or vocalizing towards the stimulus; producing a proto-word or a word relative to
the stimulus; re-enacting the movement of the stimulus.

Pointing comprehension was coded when the infant was able to correctly localize the
stimulus pointed to by the experimenter by looking at it, ﬁrst, and then as imperative or
declarative according to the following operational deﬁnitions:

. Imperative comprehension: the child responded to the adult’s pointing gesture
. Declarative comprehension: the child answered the adult’s pointing gesture by

stimulus on the table near the adult.

looking to the adult and smiling or vocalizing towards the stimulus, producing a
proto-word or a word related to the stimulus, or re-enacting the movement of
the stimulus.

Intention understanding
The child was tested on the ‘Demonstration of
Intention’ condition in the
Re-enactment task (Meltzoff, 1995). The task measures children’s understanding of
others’ intentions when someone is trying to perform a speciﬁc action. The ﬁve
stimuli used in the task and the actions performed by the experimenter were exact
duplicates of those used by Meltzoff (1995). The experimenter modelled with each
stimulus the intention to perform the act for the child (i.e. the experimenter was
seen trying, but failing, to perform the act on each of ﬁve objects). The order of
presentation of the ﬁve objects was counterbalanced. The intention to produce the
act was modelled three times and was followed by a 20-second response period for
each object. The experimenter did not provide linguistic or facial expressions of
failure. In the intention-understanding task, the number of target actions produced
by each child on all objects was scored (range 0–5).

Measurements at 39 months of age
The observation was carried out in a quiet place in the home in the presence of a parent
or a babysitter. After a warming-up period, three socio-cognitive tasks were administered
as indices of children’s theory of mind abilities. Each observation was videotaped with a
portable video-camera.

(1981) was used. This is a classical

Perception-understanding task
A version of the Level 1 visual perspective-taking task of Flavell, Everett, Croft, and
Flavell
task used to evaluate children’s
understanding of what another person can and cannot see. Children were shown a
coloured, plastic card (12 £ 12 cm) with a picture on one side (e.g. a dog) and a
different picture on the other side (e.g. a cat). The experimenter showed the
child that different pictures were on each side of the card. Then she asked: ‘What do
you see, a dog or a cat? What do I see, a dog or a cat?’ The child could
answer by either naming the picture or by pointing to one side of the card. The order
of
the two questions was counterbalanced. Three cards were used: Cat/Dog;
Tree/Flower; and Shoes/Sun. Children answered correctly when they reported
both what they and the other person could see. Children received a score ranging
from 0 to 3.

Intention-understanding task
The false-belief condition of the transparent intention task of Russell, Hill, and Franco
(2001) was used. This task measures children’s ability to understand their previous
intentions using a procedure that is not linguistically demanding. The child was shown a
transparency on which there was an incomplete drawing (e.g. a boy’s head without an
ear). Then the child was given a pen and invited to ﬁnish the drawing. When the child
ﬁnished, the experimenter revealed that, in fact, he/she had been drawing on the
uppermost of two overlaid transparencies. In the uppermost transparency there was a
less complex picture of the underling transparency with the lines that were perfectly
corresponding to some of the lines of the underling transparency. For this reason they
were not visible. Removing the top transparency showed that the line drawn by the
child had, in fact, completed the drawing of a cup on the top transparency, with the ‘ear’
outline now representing a handle of a cup. The experimenter then asked the child
what he/she thought s/he had been drawing: ‘Did you think you were drawing an ear or
did you think you were drawing a handle?’ Children were presented four transparency
pictures: (1) Ear (Face)/Handle (cup); (2) Smoke (chimney)/Smoke (boat); (3) Top of the
tree/Ice-cream; and (4) Face (girl)/Face (boy). The order of presentation of the four trials
was counterbalanced across children. Children answered correctly when they reported
that they thought they were drawing the previous drawing and not the ‘actual’ drawing.
Children received a score ranging from 0 to 4.

Psychological explanation task
A modiﬁed version of the Bartsch and Wellman’s procedure (1989; ﬁrst study) was used.
This task measures, through an experimental procedure, children’s natural tendency to
explain others’ actions in a psychological way. Children were presented nine stories
with simple descriptions of a character engaging in a speciﬁc action. Each story was
accompanied by an illustration of the story with the character, the object and the ﬁnal
location, all presented on a single coloured page. There were three kinds of stories: (1)
Neutral stories, in which the characters are engaging in simple actions (e.g. Here is
Marta. Marta is looking for her kitten behind the table); (2) Anomalous-desire stories, in
which the characters are engaging in actions that do not directly ﬁt with what the
characters like (e.g. Here is Giulia. These are apples. Giulia does not like apples. But now
she is taking an apple); and (3) Anomalous-belief stories, in which the characters are
engaging in actions that are based on false beliefs (e.g. Here is Tommaso. This is a rock
that looks like a peanut. Tommaso is putting it in his mouth). For each kind there were
three short stories.

In each story, after the experimenter told the child what was happening, she asked
explanation questions ‘Why do you think : : : is doing that?’ If the child responded with
anything other than an attribution of desire or belief, the experimenter simply repeated
the ‘why’ question with premise information. The aim of the second ‘why’ question was
to extend the reasoning opportunities for the child to explain the action in terms of
desires or beliefs. The number of psychological explanations given by the children was
counted. If the child did not respond with a desire or belief attribution, or if the answer
was unclear, following Bartsch and Wellman (1989), the experimenter asked a desire or
a belief prompt ‘What does : : : .want/think?’ Desire prompts were given on the
Anomalous-desire stories and on the second Neutral story. Belief prompts were given on
the Anomalous-belief stories and on the ﬁrst and third Neutral stories. However, these
answers were not analysed in the present study.

Psychological explanations included statements that appealed to psychological
causes, such as desires, beliefs, and other psychological states such as physiology,
perception, emotion, pretence, preference, and traits ( Bartsch & Wellman, 1989; Schult
& Wellman, 1997). Each story was coded as to whether participants provided at least
one psychological explanation, so the maximum number of psychological explanations
was 9 (one for each story).

Language
Children were administered the Italian adapted and standardized PPVT (Stella, Pizzoli,
& Tressoldi, 2000) in order to examine their receptive vocabulary.

Reliability
Two independent observers coded a random selection of 28% of the videotaped
observations carried out at 12 and 15 months. Reliability for the pointing task and for the
intention-understanding task was calculated by Cohen’s kappa. In the pointing task,
reliability was assessed for each target behaviour. Kappa values on children’s pointing-
gesture task at 12 months were: .83 for imperative production; .95 for imperative
comprehension; .93 for declarative production; and .91 for declarative comprehension.
Kappa values at 15 months were: .92; .98; .91; and .98, respectively. Reliability was high
across conditions. In the intention-understanding task, reliability was measured on the
target action with a kappa of 1.0 at the ﬁrst observation and .94 at the second
observation.

Reliability for the observation at 39 months was assessed only for the psychological
explanation task. Two coders categorized the children’s explanations. Reliability was
assessed for 25% of the sample. Cohen’s kappas for psychological explanations used by
the children ranged from .93 to .95. In general, there was a good level of reliability.

agreement unnecessary.

Results
General results
Measures at 12 and 15 months of age were the proportion of the target actions out of
total number of valid trials. In the same way measures at 39 months of age were the
proportion of correct answers out of total number of valid trials. All the proportions
were then submitted to arcsine transformation for the analyses.

Table 1 shows means and standard deviations (in proportions) for all

the
experimental variables at 12, 15 (precursor abilities), and 39 months of age (theory-of-
mind abilities). Children’s mean PPVT score at 39 months was 84.93 (SD 6.54).
Preliminary analyses for every single variable showed no effects due to gender or to
order of birth, so these variables were collapsed for further analyses.

A series of paired-sample t tests were conducted in order to examine how the
precursor abilities developed from 12 to 15 months of age. Imperative comprehension
did not signiﬁcantly improve from 12 to 15 months of age (tð34Þ ¼ 21:86; p ¼ :072).

(tð34Þ ¼ 24:07; p , :0001). In sum, imperative comprehension was the only ability that
children already manifested at the age of 12 months and did not signiﬁcantly develop at
the age of 15 months. A paired-sample t test examining the target acts produced
by children in the understanding-of-intention task revealed that children produced
signiﬁcantly more target acts at 15 months than at 12 months (tð34Þ ¼ 28:62;
p , :0001).

the age of 12 months,

The relationship between the measures at 12 and 15 months was examined through
correlations. One-tailed correlations were computed since only positive correlations
between the measures were expected. At
imperative
comprehension was signiﬁcantly correlated with imperative production (rð33Þ ¼ :41;
p , :01) and declarative comprehension (rð33Þ ¼ :41; p , :01). Declarative comprehen-
sion signiﬁcantly correlated with declarative production (rð33Þ ¼ :46; p , :01).
Intention understanding was signiﬁcantly correlated with imperative comprehension
(rð33Þ ¼ :39; p , :05), declarative comprehension (rð33Þ ¼ :32; p , :05), and declara-
tive production (rð33Þ ¼ :36; p , :05). No other signiﬁcant correlations were found at
this age.
At the age of 15 months, signiﬁcant correlations were found between imperative
comprehension and imperative production (rð33Þ ¼ :32; p , :05), declarative compre-
hension (rð33Þ ¼ :37; p , :05), and declarative production (rð33Þ ¼ :39; p , :01).
Declarative production was also signiﬁcant correlated with imperative production
(rð33Þ ¼ :34; p , :05) and declarative comprehension (rð33Þ ¼ :33; p , :05). No other
signiﬁcant correlations were found at the age of 15 months.

As far as correlations between 12 and 15 months are concerned, all the pointing
abilities, with the exception of declarative comprehension, were signiﬁcantly correlated
with themselves at the two ages: imperative comprehension (rð33Þ ¼ :29; p , :05);
imperative production (rð33Þ ¼ :30; p , :05); declarative production (rð33Þ ¼ :45;
p , :01); and intention understanding (rð33Þ ¼ :34; p , :05). Imperative production at
15 months was also signiﬁcantly correlated with declarative comprehension
(rð33Þ ¼ :31; p , :05) and declarative production (rð33Þ ¼ :29; p , :05) at 12 months.

Declarative production at 15 months was signiﬁcantly correlated with imperative
comprehension (rð33Þ ¼ :46; p , :01), imperative production (rð33Þ ¼ :34; p , :05);
and declarative comprehension (rð33Þ ¼ :31; p , :05) at the age of 12. Therefore,
declarative production at the age of 15 months was signiﬁcantly correlated with all the
pointing measures at the age of 12 and 15.
For the abilities at the age of 39 months, a signiﬁcant correlation was found between
children’s perception understanding and their intention understanding (rð33Þ ¼ :42;
p , :01). Correlations between these two abilities and children’s use of psy-
chological explanations and their PPVT score were absent. Moreover, children’s
psychological explanations were signiﬁcantly correlated with their score in PPVT
(rð33Þ ¼ :63; p , :001).

Relations between abilities at 12 and 15 months and abilities at 39 months
In order to examine the relationship between the abilities at 12 and 15 months and the
abilities at 39 months, initial bivariate zero-order correlations were computed. Hereafter,
considering the wide age range at 12 (9–14 months) and 15 months (12–17 months), we
conducted ﬁrst-order partial correlations in order to control for the effect of age. Finally,
we tested whether the signiﬁcant correlations that we found could be accounted for by
a more general association between the examined abilities and verbal language. Infant
pointing at 12 and 15 months as well as intention understanding failed to correlate with
PPVT scores at the age of 39 months. At the age of 39 months, perception understanding
and intention understanding did not correlate with PPVT scores. Since a signiﬁcant
correlation was found between children’s use of psychological explanations and PPVT
scores, second-order partial correlations between the precursor abilities and the theory
of mind abilities, which accounted for the effects of age and of PPVT scores were
conducted. Table 2 shows the zero-, ﬁrst-, and second-order correlations between the
precursor abilities at 12 and 15 months of age and the theory-of-mind abilities at 39
months of age.

Two abilities in the second year of life predicted the later theory of mind abilities,
imperative comprehension at the age of 12 months and intention understanding at the
age of 12 and 15 months.

As Table 2 shows, for the zero-order correlation imperative comprehension at the
age of 12 months signiﬁcantly correlated with children’s later use of perception
understanding and to psychological explanations. The relation remained sig-
niﬁcant when controlling for the effect of age and language (ﬁrst- and second-order
correlations). Where imperative comprehension at 15 months is concerned, we
observed a trend towards the use of psychological explanations (rð33Þ ¼ :27; p ¼ :054).
The trend became signiﬁcant when controlling for the effect of age (ﬁrst-order
correlations) but did not remain stable when controlling for the effect of language
(second-order correlations; rð31Þ ¼ :21; p ¼ :115). In sum, a relationship was found
between children’s understanding of the pointing gesture with a requestive motive at 12
months and the later ability to understand the others’ point of view and to explain
others’ actions in terms of mental states. This relationship did not vary when controlling
for the effect of age and language. Imperative comprehension did not correlate with the
understanding of intention.
As far as intention understanding is concerned, we observed a trend towards
intention understanding at 12 months and perception understanding (rð33Þ ¼ :26;
p ¼ :064) and intention understanding (rð33Þ ¼ :24; p ¼ :082) at the age of 39 months.

These trends became signiﬁcant when ﬁrst- and second-order correlations were
computed. Intention understanding at 15 months signiﬁcantly correlated to perception
and intention understanding at 39 months with zero-order correlations. These
correlations remained signiﬁcant when ﬁrst- and second-order correlations were
computed. In sum, infants’ understanding of intention at 12 and 15 months of age was
related to the later ability to understand perception and intention also when controlling
for the effect of age and language. Intention understanding at 12 and 15 months did not
correlate to the use of psychological explanations.

The other pointing abilities at 12 and 15 months failed to correlate with the theory

of mind abilities at the age of 39 months.

Discussion
In this study, we examined whether two abilities – pointing gestures and intention
understanding – that develop in the second year of life, are related to children’s later
theory of mind performances at the age of 39 months. The basic idea was that the same
socio-cognitive architecture lies behind these early socio-cognitive abilities and the later
theory of mind achievements. This structure allows children to understand that other
people are intentional beings with their own mental states such as attentions, desires,
beliefs, and intentions. Our results show that one out of four pointing variables
measured at the age of 12 and 15 months indeed contributed to the prediction of
understanding other minds 2 years later. As expected, young infants’ understanding of
the adult’s pointing in order to request something appeared to have a predictive value in
this respect. Unexpectedly, however, infants’ production and comprehension of the
same gesture with a declarative motive did not have a predictive value. Additionally, it
appeared that the understanding of others’ intentions at 15 months contributed to the
prediction of the later understanding of perception and intention at 39 months. These
results remained mostly intact also when controlled for age or language ability and they
conﬁrm earlier ﬁndings suggesting a causal relationship between socio-cognitive
abilities and theory of mind understanding (Charman et al., 2000; Olineck & Poulin-
Dubois, 2005; Wellman et al., 2004).

However, these outcomes also raise various questions. The ﬁrst question concerns
what is so different about imperative comprehension as compared to the other pointing
gestures that were studied, because imperative comprehension was the only gesture
that showed a predictive value with respect to children’s later theory of mind abilities,
especially at 12 months of age. In order to interpret these results, the four different
gestures that were used in this study will be discussed here separately.

Imperative production, thus pointing at something in order to request the object,
does not require much involvement with the other person because it does not require
the understanding of other people as intentional or mental (Camaioni, 1993). One could
even think of the other as an extended arm, a useful tool in order to get the desired
object. Differently, declarative pointing,
in
production, has been frequently put forward as a strong candidate for children’s later
theory of mind understanding (Baron-Cohen, 1991; Camaioni, 1997; Liszkowski et al.,
2004), because it seems to aim at directing attention and sharing experiences. However,
even though this might be the case, this does not necessarily imply involvement with
the other person. For example, a young infant preoccupied with planes could point
every time a plane passes by, and he or she might also immediately take a look when

in comprehension, and above all

someone else points and says ‘plane, plane’, but this does not necessarily imply that the
child even has the slightest interest in the other person. Instead, it shows his enthusiasm
for planes. This is emphasized by Delgado, Go´mez, and Sarria (1999), who showed that
infants also point for themselves. If this is true, the declarative conditions used in the
present study rather tapped children’s interest in the proposed objects/events than their
involvement with the other person.

Differently, imperative comprehension, in the way we operationalized it, can be
seen as a form of ‘cooperative engagement’ (Tomasello et al., 2005). In an interactive
context, the adult asked the infant to give her a part of an object, through the pointing
gesture. This signiﬁes that the child has to understand the desire underlying this gesture
in order to interpret the gesture as a request. Even when the child refuses to give the
desired object, he or she shows understanding that the other person and himself are two
independent agents, and – in this case – the infant experiences a conﬂict of interests.
This comprehension might still be an implicit one. Although infants are probably not yet
able to think about their own or others’ desires explicitly, at least they seem to recognize
them and to respond adequately. It is important to note, however, that this early form of
comprehension contributes to children’s later and more mature understanding of
others’ mental states.

Additionally, the explanation that imperative comprehension is in fact the only
pointing gesture that requires interest in the other person and that exactly children’s
recognition of this element of the task seems to contribute their later theory of mind
functioning is emphasized by the outcome that the infants’ imperative comprehension
only predicted two of the three later theory of mind abilities, namely, the two abilities
that also require engagement: perception understanding (which involved under-
standing someone else’s perspective) and mental explanations about story characters.
The intention task at 39 months, on the other hand, measured children’s understanding
of their own intention.

A second question that arises from the outcomes of our study is why only at the age
of 12 months and not at the age of 15 months imperative comprehension was related to
the later theory of mind. A possible explanation is that the age of 12 months is the best
time window or ‘sensitive period’ for ﬁnding associations between the abilities during
infancy and the abilities during childhood. In other words, it might be the best moment
to ﬁnd individual differences between children. This argument is supported by the fact
that imperative comprehension did not signiﬁcantly improve 3 months later. If this is
true, we should also take into account the possibility that the present study did not
examine the other three pointing abilities, and in particular the declarative production,
during their most sensitive period. Future research is needed in order to conﬁrm our
ﬁndings regarding the relationship between the pointing gesture and theory of mind. In
particular, older children should be examined when the pointing gesture with a
declarative motive is at a more advanced level (Moore & D’Entremont, 2001).

An interesting aspect of

the present study is that pointing and intention
understandings were related to different abilities at the age of 39 months. This result
was expected so far as we believe that theory of mind is not a unitary ability and is
inﬂuenced by other capacities such as language, executive functioning, and so on. With
the intention-understanding task, infants had to grasp the intention of the other person
behind the failed attempt to make a speciﬁc action. This task has strong perceptual and
behavioural elements, but no interaction or communication is involved in it. Differently,
the pointing gesture is produced and understood inside an interactive and
communicative context and it is strongly related to language (Bates, Camaioni,

575

& Volterra, 1975; Butterworth & Morissette, 1996). For this reason, it does not come as a
surprise that children’s performance on the intention-understanding task was related to
their later understanding of perception and intention, albeit children’s understanding of
pointing was related to their later use of psychological explanations.

In conclusion, the fact that a positive relationship was found between two socio-
understanding abilities during infancy and three theory-of-mind abilities during
childhood does not mean that, already during infancy, children are aware of mental
states. Probably, infants’ understanding of persons as intentional agents or infants’
understanding of others’ attention is implicit during infancy, and it becomes explicit
only later. In this way, we can see the development of a theory of mind as a continuum
from infancy to childhood with different developmental
forms or grades of
understanding (Chapman, 1987; Racine & Carpendale, 2007). Note also that the
ﬁndings of this study strongly suggest a causal relationship between earlier and later
socio-cognitive capacities in young children, but possible underlying cognitive
capacities that might affect both time measures may also play a role in determining
this relationship. Finally, it is obvious that theory of mind development is not a unitary
capacity, but instead, consists of different dimensions, such as desire, belief and
intention understanding, which might all develop along different pathways and require
particular precursors. Further studies could look into these issues in more depth.
