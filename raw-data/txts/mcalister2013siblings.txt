Siblings, Theory of Mind, and Executive Functioning in Children Aged

3–6 Years: New Longitudinal Evidence

Longitudinal data were obtained from 157 children aged 3 years 3 months to 5 years 6 months at Time 1. At
Time 2 these children had aged an average of 12 months. Theory of mind (ToM) and executive functioning
(EF) were measured at both time points. Results suggest that Time 1 ToM scores predict Time 2 EF scores.
Detailed examination of sibling inﬂuences suggests that beneﬁts—in terms of advanced ToM development—
accrue to children with siblings versus without, and to those with a larger number of child-aged siblings. Any
advance in either area (ToM or EF) is likely to beneﬁt the other, and early sibling interaction appears to act as
a catalyst.

Cognitive developments of the preschool period are
impressive (Flavell, 2004) and two of the most nota-
ble of these are theory of mind (ToM) and executive
functioning (EF). ToM involves a representational
understanding of others’ minds including abilities to
comprehend and predict others’ mental states of true
and false belief, memory, imagination, and the like,
even in situations where these mental states are at
odds with observable reality. Developing dramati-
cally over the period from ages 2 to 6, the prototypi-
cal tests for ToM (i.e., inferential false belief tasks) are
failed by most preschoolers at age 3 but are mastered
so universally by age 5 as to suggest that understand-
ing of belief and of mind exhibit genuine conceptual
change in the preschool years (Wellman, Cross, &
Watson, 2001). Whereas some theoretical accounts
(e.g., Leslie & Thaiss, 1992) ascribe ToM development
to the maturational unfolding of a preprogrammed,
neurocognitive module largely independent of varia-
tions in familial, social, or educational experiences,
many others highlight individual differences among
preschoolers in the pace of ToM growth (e.g., Dunn
& Brophy, 2005). Evidence also suggests that faster
rates of ToM progress among typically developing
children are linked with variations in social circum-
stances (e.g., number of siblings; Perner, Ruffman, &
Leekam, 1994) and life experience (e.g., richness of
maternal mental state conversation; Ruffman, Slade,
& Crowe, 2002), suggesting possible causal connec-
tions (Dunn & Brophy, 2005).

Another key development of the preschool years
involves increases in the EF skills that control, direct,
and monitor cognitive function and its behavioral
outcomes (Zelazo, Carlson, & Kesek, 2008). These
include inhibitory control, working memory, resis-
tance to interference, and set shifting (Garon, Bryson,
& Smith, 2008). EF skills are believed to be responsi-
ble for conscious, effortful control of thoughts and
actions (Oh & Lewis, 2008), and are distinct from
intelligence, including both verbal and nonverbal IQ.
Cross-sectional links between preschoolers’ ToM and
EF skills are well established (Moses, Carlson, & Sab-
bagh, 2006).

Several distinct theoretical accounts have been
put forward to explain why the EF–ToM associa-
tion arises (Carlson, Moses, & Breton, 2002). The
expression account argues that the link is relatively
superﬁcial. Children simply need EF to display
their already-developed ToM understanding in test-
ing situations, especially those relying on inferential
false belief tests. Alternatively, emergence accounts
view the association between the two capacities as
more fundamental than a simple test-performance
limitation. Although varying in detail, these argue
that much of the inﬂuence of EF is relevant in terms
of the level of ToM competence displayed (Carlson
& Moses, 2001). Without EF capability, ToM might
be impossible to acquire. Conversely, EF emergence
may equally be contingent upon the prior develop-
ment of ToM (e.g., Perner & Lang, 1999). Without

ToM-based awareness of the mind’s role and its
limitations, children might not master (or apply) EF
skills to the strategic control of their overt behavior.
Still a third possibility is that a common mediating
factor (e.g., language development) might underpin
the growth of both ToM and EF during the pre-
school period, thus explaining their observed corre-
lations with one another. Others have suggested
that a child gains better self-control once he or she
has a better understanding of his or her own mind
(Perner, 1991; Perner, Lang, & Kloo, 2002). More-
over, some researchers entertain the notion that EF
and ToM share a common set of representational
abilities (Perner, 1998) or common brain regions
(Ozonoff, Pennington, & Rogers, 1991). The cogni-
tive complexity and control theory (Frye, Zelazo, &
Burack, 1998) posit that success on false belief tests
requires a type of reasoning not unique to the
understanding of mental states. Instead, the general
intellectual ability to deal with abstract rules and
relations is thought to underpin both ToM and EF.
Regardless of the particular mechanism at play,
cross-sectional research strongly supports an overall
connection between ToM and EF in young pre-
schoolers, while highlighting a special link between
ToM and inhibitory control
(Carlson & Moses,
2001). However,
the cross-sectional methodology
has limitations when it comes to elucidating devel-
opmental pathways and distinguishing precursor,
consequent, or third-variable-mediated connections.
Longitudinal studies are thus desirable, particularly
via the cross-lagged approach in which early and
later abilities in both domains are assessed in the
same children as they grow in age and experience.
This enables examination of how gains made in one
domain (e.g., ToM) may arise out of earlier
advanced mastery of the other (e.g., EF) after con-
trolling individual variability in initial mastery of
the outcome domain itself. Accompanied by appro-
priate controls for other known EF and ToM corre-
lates (like language ability), this design allows for a
relatively pure assessment of pathways of causal
precedence and consequence.

Cross-lagged longitudinal studies of the ToM–EF
association remain scarce (Hughes & Ensor, 2007).
Nonetheless, some have been conducted (e.g., Carl-
son, Mandell, & Williams, 2004; Farrant, Maybery,
& Fletcher, 2012; Hughes, 1998; Hughes & Ensor,
2007; Müller, Liebermann-Finestone, Carpendale,
Hammond, & Bibok, 2012; Schneider, Lockl, &
Fernandez, 2005). Although these pioneering inves-
tigations have supplied very valuable information
(see below) that has served to illuminate several
key issues for the early development of EF–ToM

connections, a limitation is that they have mostly
concentrated on the earliest beginnings of ToM
from ages 2 to 3 or early 4. There is clearly a need
for additional cross-lagged longitudinal research on
EF and ToM especially with somewhat older ages,
as we will argue in detail later.

One recent study (Hughes & Ensor, 2007) of
2- to 4-year-olds extended earlier pioneering efforts
(e.g., Hughes, 1998) to examine 122 socially diverse
toddlers and found “only partial support for the
view that ToM is a prerequisite for EF” (p. 1447).
However, EF at age 2 signiﬁcantly predicted ToM
performance at ages 3 and 4. Similarly, using a mi-
crogenetic design with a small sample (N = 21) of
3-year-olds, Flynn, O’Malley, and Wood (2004)
found that earlier EF gains were linked with later
false belief mastery. However, the design entailed
monthly testing over 6 months, and comparison of
false belief understanding at adjacent testing times
showed numerous developmental
inconsistencies
with children sometimes later failing tasks they pre-
viously passed. The authors therefore advocated
longer term longitudinal research to identify possi-
ble broader patterns amid short-term inconsistency.
Carlson et al. (2004) sampled a group of 81 tod-
dlers at 24 months of age and retested them at
39 months. The EF tasks
these authors used
showed moderate stability across this age range,
but several of their lab measures of ToM at the ini-
tial test did not. In light of this, they substituted an
indirect measure of ToM at 24 months, consisting
of a listing by parents of all the words for internal
states (perception, affect, cognition, physiology) that
they believed their children knew. This language
measure correlated with later scores on laboratory
ToM tests, as well as with contemporaneous EF
measures (at 24 months). Carlson et al. were there-
fore able to use the cross-lagged method to examine
the predictive value of toddlers’ early ToM (internal
state language) on later EF performance at age 3, as
well as the cross-lagged connection from early EF
to later ToM. They found no clear support for the
former pathway, but convincing support
for the
latter. Indeed, even after controlling for early ToM
and language ability, children’s ToM scores at
39 months were predicted by their EF skills at age
2. Similarly, Müller et al. (2012) found that EF at
ages 2 and 3 predicted ToM at ages 3 and 4 even
after controlling verbal ability and prior ToM. But
early ToM did not inﬂuence later EF independently
of language ability.

This pattern has not always emerged consis-
tently. For example, Schneider et al. (2005) tested
EF and ToM in 176 children longitudinally on three

1444 McAlister and Peterson

occasions, beginning at a mean age of 3.33 years
and ending at 4.33 years. At each testing point, the
strongest associations were between language abil-
ity and each of
the other variables, with little
evidence that EF and ToM were contemporaneously
associated, after controlling for age and language.
These ﬁndings are not fully consistent with those of
Hughes and Ensor (2007) or those of Carlson et al.
(2004). In fact, Schneider et al. reported no signiﬁ-
cant predictive relation between early EF perfor-
mance and later ToM scores. Nor did age or
working memory contribute to the prediction of
ToM over and above language ability.
In other
words, despite their careful controls, large sample,
and comprehensive batteries of ToM and EF tasks,
results of this three-wave cross-lagged study were
null: ToM made no unique contribution to EF, and
EF made none to ToM, at any time point.

How are the inconsistencies among results of
these recent, longitudinal studies of early ToM and
EF connections to be reconciled? Schneider et al.
(2005) suggested that one problem might have been
their sample’s generally poor grasp of ToM at the
start of their study. In fact, throughout the longitu-
dinal period, the standard ToM tasks they used
remained difﬁcult
for their sample. Percentages
passing each task did not exceed chance even at the
ﬁnal testing.

The rationale for studying 2- and 3-year-olds
(i.e., children younger than the watershed age for
false belief mastery; Wellman et al., 2001) is to cap-
ture precursors to both EF and ToM and trace their
developmental relations over time. The important
ﬁndings from such studies (e.g., Carlson et al.,
2004; Hughes & Ensor, 2007) highlight how much
can be gained from examining these constructs as
early as possible in development. Nevertheless,
additional research is now in order with older chil-
dren (as

ment continues.

Theoretically, there are grounds for anticipating
that
connections between EF and
ToM in older pre- and primary schoolers might
differ from those observed in very early childhood.
Peer group dynamics become more salient as chil-
dren progress through pre- and primary school,
posing new ToM challenges (Dunn, 1995). New EF
challenges likewise arise in a more academically
oriented classroom and via competitive games and
sports.

Indeed the known EF gains at

possible changes in its patterns of interconnection
with ToM. Empirically, further study of older chil-
dren is desirable to balance the preponderant past
focus on those younger than 4.5 years. Indeed only
two known studies of older, typically developing
children have been published (Farrant et al., 2012;
Razza & Blair, 2009) and each had limitations.
Razza and Blair (2009) failed to measure EF at Time
2, but found no predictive relation between early
EF (at age 5) and ToM 1 year later. Farrant et al.
(2012) failed to measure general
language ability
and had only one EF task. Also, paradoxically, their
Time 2 ToM measure was unrelated to chronologi-
cal age. Nevertheless, their ﬁndings supported sev-
eral with younger preschoolers in showing early EF
predicted later ToM but not vice versa. Thus,
although these ﬁndings are suggestive,
there is
clearly a need for further study of older preschool-
ers and young primary schoolers, and this is one
aim of the present research.

The other major aim of our study was to exam-
ine whether having siblings at home, versus being
an only-child, might inﬂuence the development of
ToM and EF skills and their connections to one
another. Past research has suggested that preschool-
ers often develop ToM understanding rapidly when
they have one or more siblings to interact with at
home (e.g., Jenkins & Astington, 1996; Perner et al.,
1994; Peterson, 2000; Ruffman, Perner, Naito, Par-
kin, & Clements, 1998). Children with siblings have
daily access to other children’s minds via mutual
engagement in pretend play (Perner et al., 1994),
sibling disputes (Randell & Peterson, 2009), and
child-oriented conversation (Dunn & Brophy, 2005).
They can also eavesdrop on parents’ disciplining or
teaching of siblings. Sibling interaction may also
trigger strategic EF skills for winning games (Cole
& Mitchell, 2000) or alert preschoolers to ToM-
based consideration of others’ outcomes or feelings
(Ruffman, Perner, & Parkin, 1999). Thus, sibling
experience might conceivably favor the rapid devel-
opment of both ToM and EF. Indeed, Cole and
Mitchell (2000) postulated that the development of
effortful
impulse control might be facilitated in
households with more siblings owing to demands
to delay gratiﬁcation during conﬂict and play. Some
cross-sectional evidence supports these predicted
associations between the household sibling compo-
sition, EF, and ToM, independently of age and lan-
guage (e.g., McAlister & Peterson, 2006). However,
such associations are not always found (e.g., Cole
& Mitchell, 2000).

One issue to consider in exploring links between
presence of siblings and the preschooler’s ToM and

EF development is the sibling’s age. As Peterson
(2000) noted, previous studies have not always
reported information on siblings’ ages and there
may be upper and lower limits on the ages at
which siblings may be of any developmental bene-
ﬁt. For example, a young infant sibling is probably
too immature to interact independently with the
preschooler in ways that could beneﬁt ToM or EF
development. Adolescent and adult siblings, con-
versely, might so resemble parents as to create a
social environment similar to the only-child’s. We
therefore deﬁned participants as having child-aged
siblings only if the sibling was over 12 months and
under 13 years in age. We then performed the fol-
lowing comparisons of ToM and EF performance:
(a) only-child versus has at least one sibling, (b)
participant’s total number of child-aged siblings,
and (c) birth order in the sibling constellation
(eldest, etc.).

Method

Participants

The participants were 157 children (75 boys, 82
girls) aged 3 years 3 months to 5 years 6 months
(M = 4 years 2 months, SD = .57 years) at Time 1.
All children were recruited from Australian kinder-
gartens and preschools that drew families from a
variety of working-, middle-, and upper-middle-
class neighborhoods. We had no information on the
speciﬁc incomes, education, or occupations of our
participants’ parents. However, population census
ﬁgures for
the neighborhoods from which we
recruited indirectly suggest that maternal education
levels are predominantly high school completion or
above (e.g., across the neighborhoods from which
we sampled, 91% of female residents aged 20 to
34 years have completed 12 years of secondary
schooling; Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008).
Most children in the sample (94.9%) came from
Anglo-Australian or other English-language families
(e.g., New Zealand, Ireland, Canada), whereas the
remainder had at least one parent of East Asian
(3.2%),
(1.3%), or German
(0.6%) heritage. All children spoke English as their
ﬁrst language and none had any suspected or diag-
nosed developmental disorder. We tested all of
these children again at Time 2 when they had aged
(SD = 1.57 months).

Actual delay periods ranged from 9 months to
15 months, so that chronological ages ranged from
4 years 3 months to 6 years 8 months at Time 2
with a mean age of 5.17 years.

Sibling background. Eighty-ﬁve percent of

the
sample (n = 133) lived with at least one child-aged
(i.e., ages 1–12 years) sibling at Time 1, whereas 24
children (15%) were only-children without child
sibling access. Of these 24 singletons, 21 (or 13% of
the entire sample) had no siblings at all, whereas 3
children had a preverbal
infant sibling only. At
Time 2, respective percentages with versus without
child siblings were 87% and 13%.

Longitudinal Design

Children’s ToM, EF, and language ability were
individually measured at each of the longitudinal
time points. At Time 1 this was at preschool. At
Time 2 it also was if still enrolled, or otherwise at
home (for those who had moved on to primary
school). Because testing was comprehensive and
lengthy, it occurred over two sessions (with a time
lag of 1 week) both at Time 1 and at Time 2. The
order of tasks and trials within tasks was varied
systematically.

Task Order, Materials, Procedures, and Scoring

At Time 1, children completed a battery of four
ToM tasks, two EF tasks, and a language measure
(Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test [PPVT]). At Time
2, we selected new and more challenging test bat-
teries for ToM (four tasks) and EF (four tasks) while
repeating the PPVT. Previous empirical evidence, as
detailed below, informed task selection. At Time 1,
Session A had (in this order) the following: Route
Navigation (two trials), Appearance–Reality Trial
A, Unseen Displacement False Belief (two trials),
and PPVT; whereas Session B had (in order) the
following: Misleading Container False Belief, Pre-
tend Play Trial A, Route Navigation EF (two trials),
Appearance–Reality Trial B, Pretend Play Trial B,
and Resisting Instructions EF. The Time 2 tasks
were (Session A) as follows: Hand Game, Card Sort
A, Appearance–Reality A, Card Sort B, Appearance
–Reality B, Unseen Displacement False Belief (two
trials), Emotion False Belief, and (Session B) Resist-
ing Instructions EF, Real–Apparent Emotion (ToM),
Tower of London EF, and PPVT. Table 1 shows all
descriptive statistics.

Details and rationale for Time 1 ToM tasks. The
tasks used to measure ToM at Time 1 were selected
because they are widely used, reliable measures of
a broad range of core ToM skills that would be
likely to provide adequate variance in the level of
difﬁculty between tasks. This was essential to detect
early signs of ToM awareness among our youngest

participants. Because most of the children tested at
Time 1 were below the age when false belief tasks
are consistently passed (Wellman et al., 2001), we
ensured against ﬂoor effects by following Hughes
and Ensor’s (2005) strategy of including tests of the
understanding of the representational nature of pre-
tend play, in addition to standard false belief and
appearance–reality tasks. The two Time 1 false
belief
tests, unseen displacement and misleading
container, had two test
trials each, plus control
questions. The former was a replication of Baron-
Cohen, Leslie, and Frith’s (1985) “Sally-Ann” task
with two trials. Each included one test question
and two control questions. Both were enacted and
scored exactly as described by the original authors
except a boy doll replaced “Ann” (for a rationale,
see Peterson & Siegal, 1999). On each trial, a child
could earn 1 point for correctly answering the test
and all control questions. If the control questions
were passed, but the test question failed, the child
scored 0. Data were excluded for any child who

did not pass both control questions. Taking into
account performance on both trials, children could
earn a maximum of 2 points for the task as a
whole. The misleading container test
(Gopnik &
Astington, 1988) involved a Band-Aid box contain-
ing pencils. There were two test questions (one
about own prior belief and one about the belief of a
naïve classmate) plus one control question. To earn
1 point, children needed to pass the control ques-
tion and answer both test questions correctly.
Scores on unseen displacement and unexpected
contents false belief tasks were signiﬁcantly corre-
lated, r(156) = .23, p < .01. Thus (so that false belief
would be given equal weighting in the ToM com-
posite to appearance–reality and pretend represen-
tation), a total
false belief proportion score was
created for each child by ﬁrst dividing scores on
the unseen displacement task by 2, then averaging
across this and the misleading container task. These
decimal false belief proportion scores could range
from 0 to 1.

1447

The appearance–reality test had two trials. The
stimulus for the ﬁrst was an apple-shaped candle.
The second used a realistic ﬂower that was actually
a ballpoint pen. Each had an initial control question
(“What is this?”) and two test questions (“What
does it look like to your eyes? and “What is it
really and truly?”). Administration and scoring of
each trial followed Flavell’s (1986) procedure. Chil-
dren passed a trial (to earn 1 point) only if all three
questions were answered correctly. Trial scores
were signiﬁcantly correlated, r(156) = .53 p < .001,
so an appearance–reality total (0–2; Table 1) was
subsequently converted to a proportion score for
the ToM composite.

Finally, at Time 1, awareness of the representa-
tional nature of pretending and was tested exactly
as in McAlister and Peterson (2007). For each of two
trials, a familiar, real object (banana or potato) was
shown and participants had to pretend it was some-
thing else (i.e., the banana was a phone, the potato
was soap). Once pretense was effectively enacted
(which all children did), there were four test ques-
tions: (a) “What is this really?” (b) “What did we
pretend this was?” Then additional objects were
placed beside the stimulus, a real version of the pre-
tend item (e.g., a real phone) and an irrelevant
decoy (e.g., a tennis ball) and questions (c) “Which
one did we pretend was a [phone or soap]?” and (d)
“Which one is really a [phone or soap]?” were
asked. Although each trial had four test questions,
the maximum score per trial was 1. This was
achieved only when all
four questions were
answered correctly. Any other response pattern
earned 0. Scores on the two trials were signiﬁcantly
correlated, r(156) = .24, p < .01, so a proportional
score was created with a range from 0 to 1.

Time 1 ToM total score. False belief proportion
scores correlated with proportion scores on appear-
r(156) = .29, p < .001, and pretend
ance–reality,
representation, r(156) = .50, p < .001, and the latter
two were also signiﬁcantly correlated, r(156) = .29,
p < .001. Furthermore, each of
these correlations
remained statistically signiﬁcant in partial correlations
controlling for age and language ability, rs(154) = .22,
.44 and .23, all ps < .01. Given this, a combined pro-
portional Time 1 ToM scale score (a decimal from 0 to
1) was calculated as a combined proportion calculated
as their sum divided by 3. We elected this averaging
method because we wanted to give equal weighting
to each separate, conceptually distinct aspect of ToM.
Cronbach’s test revealed adequate internal consis-
tency (a = .63) for the Time 1 composite.

Details and rationale for Time 1 EF tests. Two EF
tests, route navigation and resisting instructions,

exactly replicated Cole and Mitchell’s (2000) battery
that has been used successfully for groups of a similar
age. The former captures EF for forward planning,
attention to relevant features, resisting distraction,
and the latter, response inhibition. The four route nav-
igation trials were presented and scored (exactly as
originally) via maze maps with direct versus indirect
paths to a goal and children passed by tracing the for-
mer, perfectly, otherwise 0. Sums over trials (0–4)
were converted to decimal proportions just as for the
combined ToM scores (see above).

for each test

Resisting instructions, assessing inhibitory con-
trol, was Cole and Mitchell’s (2000) adaptation of
Reed, Pien, and Rothbart’s (1984) test. Questions
and procedure were identical to Cole and Mitch-
ell’s, but we replaced their squirrel and badger with
locally familiar bear and lion puppets. Over 12
trials, the “good” puppet alternated with the “bad”
one in issuing commands (e.g., “clap your hands”).

following the instruction to ignore the latter (i.e.,
remain still) to a maximum possible task total of 6
points. “Good” puppet
trials were not
scored. Although there were no practice trials per
se, each child had passed a memory control ques-
tion at the beginning by pointing correctly both at
the puppet to be obeyed and the one to be ignored.
In line with Cole and Mitchell’s procedure, a pause
after every fourth trial required children to conﬁrm
who should be ignored. All children scored per-
fectly on these controls. A total proportion score
was created by dividing totals by 6.

(control)

trial

Time 1 EF total score. Scores on route navigation
and resisting instructions were signiﬁcantly corre-
lated, r(156) = .39, p < .001, even after age and
language were partialed out, r(154) = .32, p < .001.
Hence a composite proportion, the “EF scale score”
(0–1) was created.

Time 1 language ability. A widely used, norm-
referenced receptive vocabulary test, the PPVT (Dunn
& Dunn, 1989), was our measure of language ability.
This test of receptive vocabulary was scored accord-
ing to the test manual to yield raw scores (dubbed
PPVT herewith) and standardized verbal mental age
estimates (dubbed VMA). Although the test is stan-
dardized only on a U.S. population, widespread Aus-
tralian use of this test (particularly the second edition
that we selected for this reason) has conﬁrmed its
local suitability (e.g., Oddy et al., 2003).

Time 2 Tasks and Scoring

Time 2 ToM tests. At Time 2 we employed a bat-
tery of four ToM tasks that were selected to provide

1448 McAlister and Peterson

a greater challenge than the tests used at Time 1,
thereby making them more appropriate for use
with an age group not only 1 year older but also
including mostly 5- and early 6-year-olds who nor-
matively pass ﬁrst-order false belief (Wellman et al.,
2001). For continuity with Time 1, the unseen dis-
placement false belief task (two trials) and appear-
ance–reality (two trials) were retained. Then,
to
increase difﬁculty and guard against ceiling effects,
the remaining two tasks in the Time 2 battery were
two more challenging ToM measures requiring
emotional inferences. First, we used a real–apparent
emotion task closely modeled on one devised by
Wellman and Liu (2004). Using Guttman scaling,
these authors found that the ToM concept assessed
by this task—understanding that someone may dis-
play a false emotion on purpose (as when a boy
hides his sadness to avoid being called a baby)—is
a more advanced ToM concept than false belief. In
our version, with exactly Wellman and Liu’s pic-
tures, procedure, and question wording, plus an
additional stringent control question (as per Peter-
son, Wellman, & Liu, 2005), children heard a story
about a boy, teased by his friends, who did not
want them to tease him more. An initial control
question asked how the boy really felt. The test
question then asked how he made his face look.
Correct answers to the latter required both accurate
(pictorial or verbal) emotion selection (i.e., one emo-
tion more positive than for the “true feeling”) and,
as in Peterson et al. (2005), accuracy on a further
control question, “Why did he try to look like
that?” Children had to display clear comprehension
of the protagonist’s intention to conceal true feel-
ings to pass the latter. One point was assigned
when children answered all questions correctly,
otherwise 0.

The second advanced Time 2 ToM task was an
emotion false belief test that other authors have
shown to be more difﬁcult than ﬁrst-order false
belief
(e.g., Bender, Pons, Harris, & de Rosnay,
2011; Hughes et al., 2000). In the version we used,
borrowed from Hughes et al. (2000), a puppet who
liked animal cookies left and the child helped ﬁll an
animal cookie box with rocks. On the puppet’s
return there were two test questions: (a) “How will
[puppet] feel when we give him this all closed up
like this?” (happy), (b) “How will he feel when he
opens the box and sees rocks?” (sad or angry) plus
a control question, and (c) “What does [puppet] like
to eat?” (animal cookies). Raw scores (test question
sum) were converted to mean proportions (0–1). As
noted above,
the two-trial unseen displacement
false belief test was also retained from Time 1 with

(all
ps  .01) that remained uniformly signiﬁcant with
age and PPVT controlled (all ps  .01). As at Time
1, we computed a total ToM scale score using two
steps. First, proportion scores were computed for
the unseen displacement false belief test, the emo-
tion false belief test, and the appearance–reality test.
These three proportions (0–1) were summed with
the real–apparent emotion score (0–1) and divided
by 4 to yield a proportion score (0–1). This compos-
ite had a Cronbach’s alpha of .79, indicating ade-
quate internal consistency.

new objects, dolls, and hiding places, and scored
exactly as at Time 1. The same was true of the two-
trial appearance–reality task from Time 1. New
objects were a carrot-pen and a dice-shaped jewelry
box.

Time 2 EF tests. At Time 2, four tasks were used
to measure EF. We retained the resisting instruc-
tions task from Time 1 as it measured inhibitory
control, an EF concept of known relevance to pre-
school ToM (Carlson et al., 2002). Furthermore, this
task had proved highly challenging to our sample
at Time 1, with few children scoring perfectly (see
Table 1). Administration was identical to Time 1,
except a bird puppet replaced the “nice” bear, and a
monkey, the “naughty” lion. Children’s totals (0–6)
were converted to proportions (0–1) exactly as at
Time 1.

The results for Time 1 (see Table 1) suggested
that the route navigation task, already mastered by
half the sample at this younger age, might prove
insufﬁciently challenging 1 year later at Time 2.
Therefore, we substituted the dimensional card sort
task as developed by Frye, Zelazo, and Palfai
(1995), a task seen to demand a range of EF capaci-
ties including resistance to distraction, response
inhibition, memory, and attention to relevant fea-
tures. As in Frye et al., children were provided with
a pile of cards, each depicting either a yellow circle
or a red square. Behind each of two boxes stood an
“identiﬁcation” card: either a red circle or a yellow
square. Children were initially trained to sort the
cards on the basis of one dimension (e.g., shape).
Then, after a distraction, they were trained on a
reversal shift requiring sorting by a different dimen-
sion (e.g., color). Finally, after another distraction
there were three test trials. The ﬁrst required chil-
dren to sort ﬁve cards according to the most recent
training dimension. One point was awarded for
each correct placement, to a total of 5. Next, the
rule was reversed (without further training) and
children sorted ﬁve more cards, earning 1 point

each if correct. Finally, four trials were given with
the sorting rule alternating between every trial.
Again each correct answer scored one point. Total
possible scores, combining the three tests,
thus
ranged from 0 to 14 and were divided by 14 to give
a proportion score, in line with other tasks.

Another Time 2 EF test, the hand game, was
included to assess inhibitory control, an EF dimen-
sion shown previously to have close links with
ToM (Carlson et al., 2002). Children were told: “We
are going to play a game. First we both put our
hands behind our backs; now when I show my
hand I want you to make the same shape as me. So
if I make a ﬁst, you make a ﬁst, and if I point a
ﬁnger you point a ﬁnger.” After copying (control
condition) the experimenter’s actions to a total of
six consecutive correct responses (out of a maxi-
mum of 15 trials which no child in this sample
required) the test, a conﬂict condition, was given.
The tester said, “Now, if I point a ﬁnger, I want
you to show a ﬁst. And if I show a ﬁst I want you
to point a ﬁnger. So we’re not making the same
shapes.” Children earned higher scores the fewer
trials they needed to reach the criterion of six con-
secutive correct responses. Any child not achieving
criterion within 15 test trials scored 0, whereas 1
point was given for requiring the full 15 trials, 2
points for requiring only 14, 3 for 13, and so forth.
The maximum possible score was 10 if the child’s
performance was errorless. Raw scores (see Table 1)
were divided by 10 to convert to proportion scores
ranging from 0 to 1.

The Tower of London EF task, adapted from Shal-
lice (1982), was chosen as a challenging measure of
strategic forward planning, attention, and working
memory. Ours was adapted for younger children by
using only three pegs (of three different heights).
Three hollow colored balls (red, blue, green) could
slide onto the pegs: The shortest peg could hold only
one; the tallest, all three. Problems involving move-
ment of balls were presented using three-dimen-
sional models. A warm-up set, presented ﬁrst,
involved need for only a single move and was not
scored. On the fourth and subsequent trials (compris-
ing successively three of each of two-move trials,
three-move trials, and four-move problems), children
scored 2 on each trial for succeeding with minimum
moves. One move above minimum scored 1, other-
wise 0. After three consecutive 0s, the task was termi-
nated. Scores per trial (0–2) were summed and the
total (0 to 24) was divided by 24 to give a proportion
score as for other tasks.

Time 2 EF total score. All Time 2 EF measures
showed signiﬁcant correlations with one another

(all
remained signiﬁcant after controlling for age and
language (all rs  .21, all ps  .05). Cronbach’s
alpha for the four-task composite was .86, indicat-
ing good internal consistency. Time 2 EF total scale
scores were again computed proportionally to
reﬂect a decimal from 0 to 1.

Time 2 language ability. The PPVT was again
administered in full at Time 2, and raw PPVT
scores were again computed and used in all statisti-
cal analyses.

Results

Overview

Table 2 shows the raw correlations among all
key variables. Partial correlations (controlling for
age and raw PPVT scores) also appear in this table.
Correlations across the testing times (i.e., from Time
1, the initial test, to Time 2, 1 year later) are shown.
We explore these in relation to two main research
questions: (a) How does having child-aged siblings
relate to ToM and EF performance at Times 1 and
2? and (b) What do cross-lagged correlations say
about how gains over time in EF and ToM capaci-
ties relate to earlier individual differences in these
variables independently of age,
language ability,
and number of child siblings? (Each of the analyses
outlined below was run again with the exact lag
from Time 1 to Time 2 entered as a further covari-
ate. As all ﬁndings remained unchanged, results are
not reported here.)

Siblings and the Development of ToM and EF Skills

Table 2 shows the correlations between total
child-aged siblings with total ToM and EF propor-
tion scores at Times 1 and 2. In addition, to more
fully examine the role of siblings in children’s per-
formance on ToM and EF tasks at both time points,
the information regarding number of child-aged
siblings was recoded to yield an additional two
different sibling variables. Thus,
in addition to
examining the inﬂuence of the number of child-
aged siblings, we also examine presence versus
absence of child-aged siblings (dummy coded as 1
or 0), as well as the child’s birth-order position in
the sibling constellation (1 = youngest
in family,
2 = middle child, 3 = eldest in family). Correlations of
these variables with ToM and EF at each testing
time also appear in Table 2.

The correlations suggest that the presence of a
greater number of child siblings contributes to a

preschool child’s ToM and EF development. Even
after partialing out inﬂuences from age and raw
PPVT scores, number of child siblings is signiﬁ-
r(154) = .32,
cantly related to ToM at Time 1,
p < .001, and Time 2, r(154) = .26, p < .01, as well
as EF at Time 1, r(154) = .20, p < .05, and Time 2,
r(154) = .22, p < .01. Here, we question whether
ToM and EF are enhanced simply as a linear func-
tion of number of child siblings or if the relations
observed thus far might simply reﬂect an advan-
tage of sibling presence (in any number) over the
absence of siblings. We start with an examination
of sibling presence versus absence.

it

relates

Sibling presence versus absence as

to
ToM and EF. A one-way analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) (with age and PPVT raw scores as con-
trols) was used to examine the mere presence of
sibling(s) (0 = only-child) as a predictor of Time 1
ToM. A similar ANCOVA was then run with Time
2 ToM as the dependent variable. For Time 1 ToM,
the results were statistically signiﬁcant in the antici-
pated direction, with only-children (n = 24) scoring
lower on ToM (M = .43, SD = .24) than children with
least one sibling (n = 133, M = .61, SD = .25),
at
F(1, 153) = 5.76, p < .05, partial g2 = .04. In other
words, simply having a child sibling at all was of
beneﬁt. Similar results were observed in the ANCO-
VA using Time 2 ToM as the dependent variable.
Here, only-children (n = 21) with a mean ToM score
of .45 (SD = .27) were found to score signiﬁcantly
lower, F(1, 153) = 4.10, p < .05, partial g2 = .03, than
children with at least one sibling (n = 136, M = .60,
SD = .28). The results of these ANCOVA analyses
consistently support the notion of a disadvantage, at
both testing times, of only-child status for ToM
mastery.

SD = .25),

Similar ANCOVAs were used to examine EF as
a function of sibling presence or absence after con-
trolling for age and PPVT scores. With Time 1 EF
as the dependent variable,
the results paralleled
those for ToM. Only-children (n = 24) earned signif-
icantly lower EF scores at Time 1 (M = .51,
SD = .18) than children with at least one sibling
(n = 133, M = .75,
153) = 8.04,
p < .01, partial g2 = .05. A similarly signiﬁcant
effect was observed for EF scores at Time 2. Only-
children (n = 21) with a mean of
.69 (SD = .22)
were outperformed by children with at least one
sibling (n = 136, M = .81, SD = .15), F(1, 153)
= 7.67,
taking
account of age and language ability, only-child sta-
tus appeared to be a disadvantage for EF develop-
ment for children at both the age periods, just as it
was for ToM.

p < .01, partial g2 = .05. After

Number of child-aged siblings as it relates to ToM
and EF. To test whether larger numbers of child-
aged siblings were linked to higher Time 1 or
Time 2 ToM or EF scores, we ran a similar set of
ANCOVAs controlling for age and PPVT. The sib-
ling variable was recategorized as “1 child sibling,”
“2 child siblings,” or “3 or more child siblings” to
avoid distortion by the few participants with more
than three. To avoid duplicating the previous set of
regressions, we used only the children with at least
one sibling in these analyses. (Note, however, that
Table 2 includes correlations from the full sample,
including only-children.)

Number of child-aged siblings was a signiﬁcant
overall predictor of Time 1 ToM, F(2, 128) = 7.21,
p < .01, partial g2 = .10, supporting our hypothesis.
Planned comparisons revealed no signiﬁcant differ-
ence between children with one versus two siblings
(n = 74, M = .56, SD = .25 and n = 41, M = .60,
SD = .20, respectively), contrast estimate = .03, ns.
However, children with three siblings or more
(n = 18, M = .83, SD = .25) outperformed those with
two siblings (contrast estimate = .23, p < .01), as well
as
those with only one sibling (contrast esti-
mate = .32, p < .001). Time 2 ToM revealed the same
pattern. Number of child siblings was the only signif-
icant variable in the model, F(2, 131) = 6.89, p < .01,
partial g2 = .10. At Time 2, there was no signiﬁcant
difference between those with one sibling (n = 66,
M = .53, SD = .25) and those with two siblings
(n = 48, M = .59, SD = .23), contrast estimate = .06,
ns. However, children with three or more siblings at
Time 2 scored higher on Time 2 ToM (n = 22,
M = .79, SD = .18) than those with two (contrast esti-
mate = .20, p < .01) or one (contrast estimate = .26,
p < .001). These ﬁndings consistently support the
hypothesized advantage, at both testing times, of
access to more siblings for rapid ToM mastery.

Similar ANCOVAs were conducted to examine
the association between EF and number of child sib-
lings at each time point. In the analysis of Time 1 EF,
the model was signiﬁcant, F(4, 128) = 10.31, p < .001,
partial g2 = .24. However, age was the only signiﬁ-
cant contributor, F(1, 128) = 25.11, p < .001, partial
g2 = .16. Number of child siblings was not a signiﬁ-
cant predictor, F(2, 128) = .91, ns. In the analysis of
Time 2 EF, the model was once again signiﬁcant, F(4,
131) = 40.42, p < .01, partial g2 = .26. Number of
signiﬁcant, F(2, 131) = 4.33,
child siblings was
p < .05, partial g2 = .06. Contrast estimates revealed
that children with two siblings (n = 48, M = .85,
SD = .11) outperformed children with one sibling
(n = 66, M = .76, SD = 17), contrast estimate = .09,
p < .01. No other contrasts were signiﬁcant.

Birth-order position in the sibling constellation as it
relates to ToM and EF. Next, we sought to deter-
mine whether a child’s position in the family’s
sibling constellation (eldest, youngest, or middle
child) is important. To answer this question, data
from only-children were set aside and additional
ANCOVAs were conducted on just those children
who had at least one sibling. Dubbed “sibling con-
stellation,” we created three categories: those who
were (a) youngest in the family (n = 97), (b) middle
children (n = 13), or (c) eldest of siblings (n = 23).

First,

in an ANCOVA with Time 1 ToM as
dependent variable, we controlled for age, PPVT
raw scores, and total sibling number (given that
middle status implied at least two siblings, whereas
many with only older or younger siblings, as for
n = 74 in our Time 1 sample, had just one). In
relation to T1 ToM,
the overall model was
statistically signiﬁcant, F(5, 127) = 7.98, p < .001,
partial g2 = .24. The age covariate was not signiﬁ-
cant. However, the covariate of PPVT raw scores
was signiﬁcant, F(1, 127) = 5.82, p < .05, partial
g2 = .04, as was the covariate of total siblings, F(1,
127) = 7.48, p < .01, partial g2 = .06. Moreover, the
target variable (sibling constellation) was not signif-
icant once these factors were statistically controlled,
F(2, 127) = 1.48, ns. In other words,
just having
younger (child-aged) siblings was no less advanta-
geous than having older siblings or being a middle
child for Time 1 ToM in this sample.

An ANCOVA with the same design was then
run with Time 2 ToM as the dependent variable. At
Time 2 there were 97 youngest children, 13 middle,
and 26 eldest in the family. Sixty-six eldest and
youngest children had only one child-aged sibling.
In relation to Time 2 ToM, the model was signiﬁ-
cant, F(5, 130) = 10.82, p < .001, partial g2 = .32.
Neither age nor PPVT contributed signiﬁcantly
(ps = .28 and .90, respectively). Number of child
siblings was a statistically signiﬁcant covariate,
F(1, 130) = 13.82, p < .001, partial g2 = .10, and (as
predicted, but in contrast to Time 1 ToM) the focal
sibling constellation variable was also statistically
p < .001, partial
signiﬁcant,
g2 = .22. The sibling advantage—in terms of ToM
development in late preschool and early primary
school—appears to accrue most strongly for chil-
dren with older siblings (i.e., those who are the
youngest in the family). Planned contrasts showed
that the estimated marginal mean of Time 2 ToM
scores for youngest children (M = .68) was greater
than that for middle children (M = .42, contrast esti-
mate =  .27, p < .001), and also eldest children
(M = .41, contrast estimate =  .25, p < .001).

130) = 18.10,

F(2,

We conducted similar ANCOVAs using EF scores
as the dependent variable, ﬁrst at Time 1 and then at
Time 2. Birth-order position (eldest, etc.) was not sig-
niﬁcantly related to EF at either time point (both
Fs < 1.67, both ps > .18). For Time 1 EF the overall
model was signiﬁcant, F(5, 127) = 7.94, p < .001,
partial g2 = .24, but the age covariate was the only
signiﬁcant predictor, F(1, 127) = 22.22, p < .001, par-
tial g2 = .15. For Time 2 EF, the model was again
signiﬁcant, F(5, 130) = 2.70, p < .05, partial g2 = .11,
but the pattern was different from that at Time 1.
Total child siblings were the only signiﬁcant Time 2
predictor, F(1, 130) = 4.22, p < .05, partial g2 = .03.

Summary of sibling associations with ToM and
EF. From the analyses thus far, we have learned
that inﬂuences from child siblings are relevant to
ToM and EF at both time points. Having any child-
aged sibling at all (i.e., not being an only-child)
appears to be consistently related to advanced ToM
and EF. Within the subgroup with at least one sib-
ling, ToM was more advanced for those with the
largest family size. EF was less consistently inﬂu-
enced, although the pattern of results at Time 2
was similar to that for ToM. Once the variables of
age, language, and total family size were statisti-
cally controlled, however, there was less consistent
evidence for any distinct
inﬂuence of particular
birth-order positions on either ToM or EF. In other
words, sibling presence (vs. absence) and total fam-
ily size each were signiﬁcantly related to ToM and
EF at Times 1 and 2. Birth order in the sibling con-
stellation only added signiﬁcantly in one case. At
Time 2, being the youngest sibling was associated
with more advanced ToM over and above the
effects associated with having more siblings, being
older, and having more advanced language.

Predictive Relations Among EF, ToM, and Siblings
Over Time

In addition to examining sibling effects on ToM
and EF performance at Times 1 and 2, another aim
of
this study was to examine relations between
individual differences in ToM and EF across the
age range 3 years 3 months to 6 years 8 months,
using cross-lagged longitudinal correlations. While
not unequivocally identifying cause–effect
rela-
tions among variables, cross-lagged correlations (in
which performance on the target variable at the
initial test time is statistically controlled to examine
later progress in that same variable) are useful for
supplying novel information on the place of EF skills
as developmental precursors versus chronological
sequels to gains in ToM understanding, and vice

versa. As well as controlling for the earlier levels of
the outcome variable via the cross-lagged method,
we also controlled statistically for the effects of age,
verbal ability, and number of child siblings.

Two separate hierarchical

regression analyses
were conducted to assess these effects. This was
because we had no a priori assumptions, or past
ﬁndings to rely upon, for the present age group. In
each hierarchical regression, Time 1 age and Time 1
PPVT scores were entered in the ﬁrst block, as con-
trol variables, along with the Time 1 score on the
target-dependent variable (i.e., Time 1 EF was par-
tialed out of the ﬁnal regression when Time 2 EF
was the outcome variable, and Time 1 ToM was
controlled when Time 2 ToM served as the out-
come). The second block was used to assess the
impact of the independent variable of interest (e.g.,
effect of Time 1 ToM on Time 2 EF). Finally, num-
ber of child siblings at Time 1 was entered in the
third block in each equation to see if this variable
made any independent contribution over and above
all other variables already in each model.

Time 1 ToM as a predictor of Time 2 EF. The
hypothesis that early ToM understanding predicts
later advances in EF test performance was tested
with a hierarchical multiple regression that had
Time 2 EF as the dependent variable. When Time 1
age, PPVT scores, and EF scores were entered as
controls in the ﬁrst block, the regression equation
signiﬁcant, R = .29, R2 = .08,
was
Fchange(3, 153) = 4.64, p < .01. As shown in Table 3,
the beta weight for Time 1 EF was signiﬁcant in

statistically

this ﬁrst block, but those for age and language were
not.

Time 1 ToM was entered in the second block. The
result was a signiﬁcant increment, R = .38, R2 = .14,
ΔR2 = .06, Fchange(1, 152) = 10.08, p < .01, indicating
Time 1 ToM made a unique contribution to the Time
2 EF variability that was predicted. The inclusion of
number of child siblings at the ﬁnal step did not
result in any increase in explained variance, R = .40,
R2 = .16, ΔR2 = .02, Fchange(1, 151) = 2.99, ns. Results
for the full model at the end of this third block are
displayed in Table 3. Time 1 ToM was a statistically
t(151) = 2.61,
signiﬁcant predictor of Time 2 EF,
p < .05, and was the only signiﬁcant predictor vari-
able in the ﬁnal equation. In other words, early
understanding of minds was linked with later gains
in EF skills independently of the other variables.
These results are consistent with the developmental
precedence of ToM-based understanding of mental
states (like false beliefs) as a link to later abilities to
deploy cognitive EF skills (like inhibitory control or
strategic memory) more effectively. Note that this
ﬁnding for the age period from 4 to 5 years that we
studied contrasts with a predominantly opposite
pattern in past studies of younger age groups, as we
discuss in more detail later.

Time 1 EF as a cross-lagged predictor of Time 2
ToM. We conducted a further hierarchical regres-
sion to test whether Time 2 ToM might be inﬂu-
enced by Time 1 EF. The model was set up as above,
except that ToM variables were substituted for EF
variables, and vice versa. Results appear in Table 4.

With control variables of age, language, and Time 1
ToM entered, the ﬁrst block was signiﬁcant, R = .23,
R2 = .06, Fchange(3, 153) = 2.97, p < .05. Neither age
nor PPVT raw scores emerged as
signiﬁcant,
ts(153) = 0.43 and 0.09, respectively, both ps > .66,
but Time 1 ToM signiﬁcantly predicted Time 2 ToM,
t(153) = 2.43, p < .05. Adding Time 1 EF in the sec-
ond block failed to increase explained variance,
R = .25, R2 = .06, ΔR2 = .00, Fchange(1, 152) = 0.97,
ns. However, when the number of child siblings was
entered in the third block, there was a signiﬁcant
change, R = .33, R2 = .11, ΔR2 = .05, Fchange(1,
151) = 8.60, p < .01. In the ﬁnal model, the inﬂuence
of number of child siblings eclipsed all other vari-
ables, including Time 1 EF, with the only signiﬁcant
beta at the ﬁnal step (see Table 4). These results sug-
gest that Time 2 ToM scores were not signiﬁcantly
inﬂuenced by Time 1 EF over the age range that we
examined. Interestingly, though, number of child
siblings was a signiﬁcant predictor of 5-year-old
ToM performance, above all other variables.

Discussion

These data contribute to a well-established litera-
ture linking ToM and EF developments among pre-
schoolers. The results are novel, however, in several
key respects. First, we used a longitudinal cross-
lagged correlation design with a somewhat older
age group than in most past research. We found,
for the ﬁrst time, that ToM performance at a mean
age of 4.17 years was signiﬁcantly related to indi-
vidual differences in children’s EF scores 1 year
later (Mage = 5.17). Furthermore, these Time 1 ToM
effects were signiﬁcant over and above the effects
of Time 1 EF upon EF skills at Time 2, and
emerged from analyses that also controlled statisti-
cally for effects of age, language skill, and number
of child siblings. In other words, how advanced a
child was in earlier mental state understanding
independently predicted EF skills at age 5, even
after
taking account of other known correlates
including language and Time 1 EF abilities.

This result was unpredicted and evidences a pat-
tern that appears relatively novel in the published
literature. As noted earlier, cross-sectional
links
between ToM and EF skills among preschool chil-
dren are well documented (Moses et al., 2006).
Fewer studies have used the more informative
cross-lagged longitudinal approach and these have
focused mainly on children who were substantially
younger than those in the present sample. While
yielding valuable insight into the earliest associa-

tions of ToM and EF in toddlerhood and preschool,
little published data track these relations longitudi-
nally further in development (but see Farrant et al.,
2012, for an exception). Importantly, when this was
done in this study, the pattern differed from that
most often observed previously. Rather than early
EF statistically predicting later ToM as is frequently
seen in younger groups (e.g., Carlson et al., 2004;
Hughes & Ensor, 2007; Müller et al., 2012), our
ﬁndings for an age period spanning, for most chil-
dren, the transition from a play-oriented preschool
curriculum to a more formal academic one in upper
pre- or early primary school, displayed the opposite
pattern. Earlier ToM emerged as a cross-lagged EF
predictor over and above other Time 1 and Time 2
correlates. Our results show this prerequisite more
clearly and less equivocally than any previous
study (including that of Hughes and Ensor, 2007,
who found no cross-lagged prediction of later EF
from earlier ToM between ages 2 and 3 or ages 3
and 4, but some suggestion of longer term predic-
tion from ages 2 to 4). Possibly the pathway
emerged more clearly in our study because our
sample was somewhat older. The more adept EF
deployment by older preschoolers or young school-
aged children who had been precocious in ToM
understanding 1 year earlier appears consistent
with Perner and Lang’s (1999) general suggestion
that children’s EF development may be enhanced
by social cognitive understanding of minds. Per-
haps this is particularly true of the understanding
of false belief, a capacity that does not normatively
emerge consistently until after ages 4.5 or 5 years
(Wellman et al., 2001). Cole and Mitchell’s (2000)
suggestion that social and conversational interaction
with siblings (particularly in contexts of disputes
and rule games) might, in theory, beneﬁt both EF
and ToM is also broadly supported by the present
ﬁndings.

Nevertheless,

there are many other possible
accounts for these results, and further investigation
and replication is clearly warranted. It would be
particularly useful for further studies to examine
the sibling variable more fully,
including direct
observation of interactions among siblings of differ-
ent ages in more naturalistic ToM-relevant and
EF-relevant everyday situations (e.g., while playing
card games, board games, or deceptive games like
hide-and-seek). Also, as Sabbagh, Xu, Carlson,
Moses, and Lee (2006) noted, it would be valuable
to include different cultural groups besides Anglo-
heritage speakers of English in these studies.
Indeed, in cross-cultural comparison of Chinese and
U.S. preschoolers, Sabbagh et al. found that Chinese

children (none of whom had siblings) signiﬁcantly
outperformed their U.S. counterparts (virtually all
of whom had at least one sibling) on EF tasks.
However,
the Chinese group was no more
advanced in ToM performance despite this early EF
advantage. Although many cultural or sampling
factors besides (or in addition to) siblings could
potentially account for these results, Sabbagh et al.
noted the absence of sibling–sibling interaction
owing to China’s one child family policy was a
plausible candidate. Indeed, those in our Australian
sample who were only-children were outperformed
on both ToM and EF at both time points.

There are also valid theoretical reasons to specu-
late that having child siblings at home with whom
to play and converse may be advantageous to early
social-cognition and early EF performance. Make-
believe play, disputes, reminiscence, and other social
and conversational interactions among young sib-
lings offer rich and varied exposure to others’ minds
in ways likely to be useful for early ToM under-
standing (Harris, 2005). At the same time, in relation
to EF, having a child sibling boosts opportunities to
compete in games and serious pursuits with an
equal, and this potentially challenges children to
develop planning, memory, strategic thought, and
inhibitory control
(Cole & Mitchell, 2000). Such
uniquely sibling-based experiences could, in theory,
accelerate both ToM and EF growth.

Indeed, a large body of past research links access
to child-aged siblings with rapid ToM growth (e.g.,
Jenkins & Astington, 1996; McAlister & Peterson,
2007; Ruffman et al., 1998) and EF (e.g., Hughes &
Ensor, 2005). The sibling link to EF has less often
been conﬁrmed (Carlson et al., 2004; Cole & Mitch-
ell, 2000), though, in one previous study that took
account of the sibling’s age (a variable likely to
place limits upon the opportunity to proﬁt from
sibling interaction; Peterson, 2000), McAlister and
Peterson (2006) found cross-sectionally that number
of child-aged siblings was a signiﬁcant raw corre-
late of preschoolers’ EF scores. However, they also
found that ToM, but not EF, exerted a unique con-
tribution when age and language ability were
statistically controlled and suggested that number
of child siblings might not contribute to EF inde-
pendently of ToM.

This conclusion, although provocative, was lim-
ited in the past by the cross-sectional nature of the
data used to support it. The present ﬁndings, via
the use of a longitudinal design, both replicated
and extended McAlister and Peterson’s
(2006)
results. When we included number of child siblings
as a potential explanatory variable, our results sup-

plied important, novel information. The longitudi-
nal results showed that children with siblings at
Time 1 scored higher on both EF and ToM, not
only contemporaneously but also longitudinally
1 year later. Furthermore, these effects were inde-
pendent of both age and language skill. We also
explored dimensions of the sibling variable in more
detail and found that number of child siblings at
Time 1 remained a signiﬁcant predictor of Time 2
ToM understanding over and above not only chro-
nological and linguistic maturity but also Time 1
levels of both ToM and EF skills.

In other words, at a mean age of 5 years, the
children in our sample who had had opportunities
to interact with child siblings at home as younger
preschoolers were better at understanding others’
minds irrespective of any beneﬁts accruing from
age, advanced language or EF skills. It is important
that this sibling–ToM association persisted at Time
2 when many children had entered full-day pri-
mary schooling. Furthermore, when we closely
examined the sibling variable in terms of its sepa-
rate aspects, we found that having a child sibling at
all (as opposed to being an only-child) was associ-
ated with more advanced ToM and EF performance
at both Time 1 and Time 2 and that this was true
over and above the potential confounds of age and
language ability. However, presence or absence was
not
the only signiﬁcant sibling effect. When we
excluded only-children greater total numbers of
child-aged siblings predicted advanced ToM at
Times 1 and 2, over and above other variables. Fur-
thermore, the beneﬁt accrued to children who were
eldest (and thus had no older siblings) as much as
to those with siblings in other birth-order positions.
For EF, by contrast, the primary predictor was the
fact of not being an only-child. These results for
ToM and EF make sense theoretically. Siblings’ dis-
tinctive patterns of conversation, play, and social
interaction are likely to supply insight into others’
thoughts and feelings (Harris, 2005) and, when
unavailable, any ToM advantages conferred by
early mastery of EF skills may be masked by the
lack of exposure to these early sibling-based sources
of ToM stimulation, as has been posited for chil-
dren growing up in China (Sabbagh et al., 2006).

Interestingly, however, our data suggest

that
siblings’ beneﬁcial effects are direct for ToM, whereas
for EF they seem to be channeled at least partially
through early ToM development. Young children
with extensive sibling experience are believed to
achieve ToM understanding precociously via their
rich exposure to conversations, play, disputes, and
other interactions (Harris, 2005). Such early expertise

in “reading” minds would then plausibly lead to
further rich and varied social participation with sib-
lings and peers in varied peer-based social activities
(Peterson, Slaughter, & Paynter, 2007) like pretend
play, strategic deception, and games. Thus, a young
4-year-old preschooler with advanced ToM under-
standing and rich sibling play experience would be
well equipped to take further advantage of the kinds
of play experiences that might most rapidly boost
EF skills.

inhibit

The process is undoubtedly a mutual one, how-
ever, with advanced ToM assisting gains in EF (as
well as further ToM gains) and vice versa. For
example, to be a valued partner in games, pre-
schoolers must
impulses to cheat, grab,
speak out of
turn, or otherwise undermine the
game. Much childhood play requires EF inhibition
skills (e.g., to avoid calling out in hide-and-seek or
treating the pretense as real). Equally, ToM-driven
understanding of the motivations and mental states
of other players is crucial to such play. Further-
more, at a metalevel, abilities to recognize the play
partner’s desires (e.g., for a cooperative, rule-abid-
ing playmate), together with strategic and mindful
negotiation and conﬂict-resolution skills are funda-
mental
inter-
actions. Thus, ToM and EF together may both build
upon past social experience (including sibling inter-
action) and facilitate further social participation.

Of course, it is important for these ﬁndings to be
replicated before any interpretations can be more
than purely
longitudinal
research with both older and younger samples
would also be useful to more fully explore possible
changes in the nature of the association between EF
and ToM with development, in line with present
ﬁndings. As Best et al.
(2009) noted, EF skills
develop importantly from age 5 onward so that
samples of children in most past cross-lagged
research may have been too young to optimally
reveal how ToM contributes to the later growth of
these later emerging EF capacities. Furthermore,
our evidence as to the importance of sibling inﬂu-
ences may also be somewhat age dependent. The
young children studied in most past longitudinal
EF–ToM research may not yet have been as capable
as those in our somewhat older sample of gaining
ToM or EF beneﬁts from conversational and social
interactions with their siblings, particularly with
siblings younger than themselves. Moreover, with
an older sample of children (who may be more
likely to have a greater number of siblings), it may
be possible to test whether the sibling effect is cur-
vilinear.
It might well be that more siblings is

“better,” but only up to a point. Because very few
of the children in our sample had more than two
siblings, and only one had more than three, a curvi-
linear relation could not effectively be tested with
present data. Furthermore, our study was limited
by the relatively broad age range of the sample at
each testing point. Few measures of EF and ToM
optimally suit the entire age range tested. Hence,
regardless of the age group of interest, future longi-
tudinal research might do well to sample larger
numbers within a narrow age band at each point
and, despite known individual variability in both
EF and ToM among children of
identical age
(Dunn, 1995), might help to circumvent the limita-

Despite these limitations, we believe our ﬁnd-

make two important contributions. One is methodo-

suggestion, they highlight the importance of includ-
ing assessment of participants’ sibling status in
future cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of
the ToM–EF relation. This hitherto largely neglected
variable clearly has important explanatory potential
that could, as in this study, assist
in clarifying
developmental patterns. Going beyond the present
ﬁndings, it will also be useful
in future work to
explore the speciﬁc kinds of interactions among sib-
lings that are most closely linked with advances in
ToM and EF skills. In terms of theory, our ﬁnding
that Time 1 ToM contributes signiﬁcantly to Time 2
EF,
together with several past studies showing
early EF’s contribution to later ToM, suggest that
neither set of skills completely precedes or
is
uniquely prerequisite to the other across early
development. Instead, when the body of longitudi-
nal research as a whole is considered,
it would
seem that advances in both cognitive domains assist
reciprocally one another, especially when the cata-
lyst of early sibling interaction is added to the

equation. Future research could proﬁtably explore
these exciting possibilities.
