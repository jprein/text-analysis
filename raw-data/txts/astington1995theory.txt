Theory of Mind Development and 

Social Understanding

A  cross-sectional, correlational study  of  30  children,  3  to  5  years  old, 
investigated relations between their theory of  mind development and social 
interaction, controlling  for  age  and  general  language  ability.  Children’s 
overell performance on 4  standard false belief  tasks  was  associated with 
their production of joint proposals and explicit role assignments during a 10 
minute  session  of  pretend  play,  False  belief  task  performance  was  not 
associated with the child’s total amount of  pretend play  or with a measure 
of empathic concern. We discuss the significance of an association between a 
laboratory measure of theory of mind development and children’s behaviour 
observed in a naturalistic setting. We argue that the description and explana- 
tion of  children’s theory of  mind and  social understanding is best  pursued 
through the combined efforts of  experimenters and ethologists. 

INTRODUCTION 

Children’s  understanding  of  mental  life  has  been  of  interest  to develop- 
mentalists ever since Piaget  investigated  their understanding  of  thoughts, 
dreams,  intentions,  and  so on  (Piaget,  1926/1929;  1932/1977).  However, 
the past decade  has seen a huge revival  of  interest in the  area, beginning 
with  Wimmer  and  Perner’s  (1983)  now  classic  study  of  children’s 
representation  of  false  belief.  The  experimental  task  used  in  this  study 
grew out of the debate generated by Premack and Woodruff’s (1978) claim 
that the chimpanzee  has a  “theory  of  mind”.  By this  they meant  that the 
chimpanzee  could  predict  human  action  by  attributing  mental  states  to 
people.  Whatever  developmentalists  thought  of  this  claim,  they  soon

picked up the term, and the investigation of children’s theory of  mind has 
been a lively field of  investigation ever since. 

Some researchers took the term rheory seriously, arguing that the child’s 
theory  of  mind  consists of  a  coherent and  interdependent set  of  mental 
concepts  (e.g.  many  of  the  contributors to  Astington,  Harris,  & Olson, 
1988).  They  investigated  children’s  acquisition  of  such  concepts  as 
belief, desire, and intention, and children’s ability to attribute such states 
to themselves and other people. The understanding of belief was the initial, 
and has remained the primary, focus of  this work. It is essentially experi- 
mental  work  in  cognitive development, which  at  least  at  first  paid  little 
attention  to  the  social  consequences of  the  acquisition  of  mental  state 
concepts. Then, researchers more interested in these social consequences 
pointed to a disparity: In the experimental studies, 4-year-old children were 
credited with a theory of mind, based on their performance on the Wimmer 
and  Perner  false  belief  task,  but  younger  children  generally failed  such 
tasks.  Yet  even  2-  and  3-year-olds are  competent participants  in  social 
interaction in their everyday family life. Dunn (1988), for example, gives a 
clear analysis and many examples of  such young children’s understanding 
of  other  family  members’ desires,  intentions, and  emotions.  There  also 
exists a wealth of evidence of 2- and 3-year-olds’ talk about their own and 
others’ mental  states  (Bretherton & Beeghly,  1982; Shatz,  Wellman,  & 
Silber, 1983). Indeed, Bretherton and her colleagues, who were among the 
first  to  use  the  term  “theory  of  mind”  in  the  developmental literature, 
argued that infants’ ability to communicate intentionally implies that they 
have  a  theory  of  mind,  albeit  an  “implicit  and  fairly  rudimentary”  one 
(Bretherton, McNew, & Beeghly-Smith, 1981, p.  340). 

Was  it  really the case, as Chandler (1988) claimed, that  investigators 
who focused on 4-year-olds’ understanding of belief were seriously under- 
estimating  younger  children’s  competence?  The  disparity  noted  earlier 
arose  perhaps  partly  as  a  result  of  the  experimental  investigators’ 
emphasis  on  cognitive  mechanisms,  and  the  ethological  investigators’ 
emphasis on social understanding. And this perhaps led the experimenters 
to  focus  on  children’s  understanding  of  representation  and  misrepre- 
sentation,  and  the  ethologists  to  focus  on  children’s  understanding  of 
motivational  states.  Each  group  acknowledged  the  other  group’s  con- 
cerns, but there was no integration of  experimental study and naturalistic 
observation of  the same group of  children. It was generally assumed that 
the ability to ascribe false beliefs to another person marked a fundamental 
change in the child’s theory of  mind. It was also assumed that children’s 
understanding of  other people’s mental states was the foundation for their 
socioemotional understanding, even if  this was an intuitive understanding 
and not a  “theory of mind”.  The fact that children with autism generally 
failed false belief  tasks and had  severe difficulties with  social interaction 

THEORY  OF  MIND 

153 

supported these assumptions. There was, however, no empirical evidence 
relating normal children’s understanding of  a person’s false belief to their 
social understanding more generally. 

Then Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Tesla, and Youngblade (1991) showed 
that  some  aspects  of  family  interaction  and  discourse,  assessed  when 
children were 2;9,  were  associated with the children’s performance on  a 
test  of  their  false belief  understanding seven months later. The  children 
who were better able to explain actions based on false beliefs at the age of 
3;4, had  at 2;9  talked more about feeling states, participated in more talk 
with their mother about causal relations, co-operated more with their older 
sibling,  and  witnessed  more  controlling  talk  from  mother  to  sibling. 
Moreover, the correlations were independent of  the child’s general verbal 
ability and the general amount of talk in the family. This was an important 
finding, indicating antecedents of  false belief  understanding in  children’s 
social lives, but there is an urgent need for further investigations. We need 
to know more about the consequences of  theory of  mind development for 
children’s social understanding. 

The aim of the study reported here was to look for correlates of theory of 
mind  development in children’s social interaction. We  wanted to investi- 
gate the possibility that children who have a well-developed theory of mind 
interact with  others  in  a  different  way  than  children of  similar  age  and 
linguistic  competence,  whose  theory  of  mind  is  less  developed.  The 
children were given a standard language test so that we could control for 
their linguistic competence, and  we took their performance on four stan- 
dard false belief tasks as an indication of their theory of mind development. 
We examined four possible correlates of false belief understanding in their 
everyday lives:  showing greater empathy towards peers,  showing higher 
levels of  pretend  play,  making joint  proposals  with  other  children,  and 
assigning  roles  to  the  self  and  others  during  pretend  play.  Empathic 
concern  was  assessed  from  peer  nominations  (Denham,  McKinley, 
Couchoud,  &  Holt,  1990)  and  the  children  were  video-taped  during 
pretend play. 

We  chose  these  four  correlates  from  many  possible  others  for  the 
following reasons. Children need  some  understanding of  other  people’s 
mental states in order to understand their emotional reactions, for example, 
sadness when a desire is unfulfilled, or surprise when a belief turns out to 
be  false  (Harris,  1989). Thus we hypothesised that  children with  a more 
developed theory of  mind would better understand their peers’ emotional 
reactions and would show more empathic concern towards them. 

Leslie  ( 1988)  has  proposed  that  the  same  meta-representational 
development underlies children’s participation  in  pretend  play  and  their 
understanding of false belief. Further, Harris (1992) has proposed that false 
belief understanding depends on the very abilities children demonstrate in 

154  ASTINGTON AND  JENKINS 

their pretend play, that is, abilities to simulate mental states that they do not 
actually  possess  and  states  of  the  world  that  do not  actually  exist.  We 
therefore  hypothesised  that  high  levels  of  engagement  in  pretend  play 
would be related to false belief understanding. 

When children engage in pretend play their activity is carried out in an 
imaginative hypothetical world. If  a group of children are to play success- 
fully together they have to share this world in  some way.  One way  is by 
making one’s own version of  the pretend world explicit so that others may 
share  it.  We  hypothesised  that  children  with  a  more  developed  under- 
standing of  false belief would be more aware that their own beliefs about 
the  pretend  world  may  not  coincide  with  the  beliefs  of  their  playmates. 
They  would  therefore  see the  need  to  make their  version of  the  pretend 
world  explicit,  and  thus  would  be  more  likely  to  offer  explicit  joint 
proposals and to assign roles explicitly to  the self or to  another child. 

The design of  this study is cross-sectional and correlational, and so we 
cannot  determine  the  direction  of  effect  in  any  associations  we  find 
between  variables.  Although  we  refer  earlier  to  the  “consequences”  of 
false  belief  understanding,  we  have  done  so  on  theoretical  rather  than 
empirical grounds. 

METHOD 

Subjects 
Children were drawn from one daycare and one nursery school affiliated 
with the University of Toronto. Both of these centres serve a well-educated 
middle  class  community.  The  subjects  were  a  subsample from  a  larger 
study  of  68  children  in  which  we  investigated  cognitive  and  linguistic 
factors associated with theory of  mind development (Jenkins & Astington, 
submitted). A total of  30 children were randomly chosen from the  larger 
group  within  the  following constraints:  Half  of  the  subsample failed  all 
false  belief  tasks  and  half  passed  two  or  more  tasks,  and  there  were 
approximately  equal  numbers  of  boys  and  girls  in  the  two  groups  (7 
boys and  8 girls in  the false belief  passing group and  8 boys and  7 girls 
in the false belief failing group). Their ages ranged from 37 months to 65 
months (mean  = 51 months, SD  = 7.8). All  the children spoke English 
fluently,  although  for  10  of  them  English  was  their  second  language. 
Peer  nominations  for  the  empathic  concern  measure  involved  all  68 
children.

Procedure 
The language ability test and the empathic concern measure were given in 
one test session, and the false belief tests in another. The children’s pretend 
play was video-taped  on a separate occasion. 

General Language Ability.  The Test of  Early Language Development 
(Hresko,  Reid,  & Hammill,  1981) was  used  to  assess  children’s  general 
language competence. This test, which has been  standardised on children 
between  3 and 7 years,  assesses syntactic and  semantic skills of children, 
and both their expressive and receptive abilities. Good test-retest reliability 
and internal consistency have been established. In Jenkins and Astington’s 
(submitted) study  it  was  found to be  highly  correlated  with  the  sentence 
memory measure in the Stanford Binet  [r(68) = 0.761. 

False  Belief  Measures.  Four  measures  of  false  belief  were  given  in 
counterbalanced order. Two were simple versions of the standard change in 
location  paradigm  (Wimmer & Perner,  1983). The  stories were  acted  out 
for the children using toys. For example, a girl doll put a crayon in her desk 
and went away. While she was gone her brother took it out, drew a picture 
with it, and put it away in a cupboard. Then the girl returned and wanted to 
draw with the crayon. The children were asked where she would look for it, 
and  two  control  questions  to  check  that  they  remembered  the  original 
location  and knew  the  actual location of  the crayon. The other two tasks 
involved something unexpected (Chandler & Helm,  1984; Perner, Leekam, 
& Wimmer,  1987). In one of these tasks, children were shown a bandaids 
box and asked what  was inside.  After they  said it had bandaids in it they 
were  shown that  it actually contained pencils.  The pencils were  put back 
inside the box and the children were asked what another child, who had not 
seen inside the box, would think was inside it before opening it. The other 
“unexpected”  task  used  the  book  from  Gopnik  and  Astington’s  (1988) 
study, in which a drawing seen through a peephole cut in a page appears to 
be a picture of  a cat’s ears, but on turning the page it is seen to be a picture 
of the petals of  a flower. The children were asked what another child, who 
saw  only  the  partial  view,  would  think  it  was  before  seeing  the  whole 
picture.  For each task the child was given a score of  0 (fail) or  1  (pass). 

Empathic  Concern  Measure.  Empathic  concern  towards  peers  was 
assessed  using  a  peer  nomination  procedure  for  preschoolers  described 
by  Denham  et al. (1990) and adapted  for use in this study. Children were 
shown photographs  of their classmates on a large board. They were asked 
to name each child to make  sure that  they  remembered all the children’s 
names.  They  were  then  asked  to nominate three  children  who  were  kind 

156  ASTINGTON AND  JENKINS 

when  other children got upset. For each child a total number of  nomina- 
tions  was  obtained.  As  the  number  of  children  in  the  different  classes 
varied,  the  number  of  nominations each  child  received  was  divided  by 
the  number  of  children  giving  nominations  in  his  or  her  class.  All  68 
children  participated  in  this  procedure  as  it  can  only  be  used  if  all  or 
most  of  the  children  in  a  class  group  are  involved.  The  data  reported 
here are just for the 30 children in the subsample. 

Pretend  Play  Video Observation.  Children playeJ  together in  groups 
of three or four in the area of their school or daycare that was usually set up 
as the house centre. The house centres were equipped like small kitchens 
with a table, chairs, a stove, pots, pans, dress up clothes, and so on. One of 
the  children’s teachers  started the  play  by  saying,  “Why  don’t you  play 
house? You could get dinner ready . . .” and then she left the room as soon 
as  the  children  began  to  play.  They  were  video-taped  for  a  period  of 
approximately  10  mintues.  Video-tapes  were  transcribed  and  coded  by 
someone blind  to the false belief scores of  children. The transcripts of  3 
groups, involving 11 children, were coded by  a second person. Inter-rater 
reliability coefficients are given below in parentheses after each variable. 
Tapes were segmented into speaker turns. A speaker turn was defined as 
one  child’s  utterance  bounded  by  another  child’s  utterances.  In  the  10 
minute period the mean number of  speaker turns per  child was 29.2 (SD 
= 1 1.1) with a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 57 [inter-rater reliability, 
r(l1) = 0.971. 

Amount  of  Pretend  Play.  Each  turn  was  coded  for  the  presence  of 
pretence. This was any speech concerned with nonliteral play and included 
playing or assigning a role, planning an imaginary activity, substituting one 
object for another, and using replica objects as real objects. Those speaker 
turns  that  did  not  qualify  as  pretence  were  excluded  from  any  further 
analysis. They included acknowledgements of  other children’s utterances 
(e.g.  “Oh”,  “OK”,  “Yes”),  comments  about  ownership  of  toys  (e.g. 
“That’s  mine”), questions about the flow of the play  (e.g.  “What are  we 
doing  now? ”),  and  imitation  of  someone  else’s  pretence  without  any 
evidence of  new elements of  pretence (e.g. a child  saying  “I need  to go 
shopping too” after another child has just said “I need to go shopping”). A 
child’s overall pretence measure was calculated as a percentage of  his or 
her total number of turns. This was done because the length of  time of play 
sessions  varied  somewhat  and  also  a  couple  of  children  showed  little 
participation in the play with other children. We did not want the measure 
to reflect the amount of time the child was involved in the play session, but 
rather the proportion of  pretend play  when the child was involved [inter- 
rater reliability, r( 11)  = 0.921. 

THEORY OF MIND 

157 

All  pretend  turns  were  coded  for  two elements:  whether  explicit joint 
proposals  were  made  and  whether  there  was  evidence  of  explicit  role 
assignment.  The raw  frequencies  of joint  proposals  and role  assignments 
were converted to percentages of the total amount of pretend play. Again, 
this was done because of variability in the length of play sessions and in the 
extent of children’s participation. It ensured that the measures reflected the 
type of pretend play skills children demonstrated when they were involved, 
independently of their level of  involvement. 

Joint  Proposals.  For  this  to  be  coded,  reference  had  to  be  made  to 
another  person  and  to  the  self  within  the  same turn.  For example,  “You 
have to stay in my arms”. Reference to self and other was also achieved by 
the use of first-person plural pronouns such as we, us, or our to specify the 
self  and other, for example, “Let’s  make cookies”,  “She ate all the pies. 
Maybe we can get them out”  [inter-rater reliability  was r( 11) = 0.941. 

Role Assignment.  This was defined as children assigning a pretend role 
to  themselves  or  to  another  child.  This  had  to  be  done  verbally  and 
explicitly  such  as,  “You  be  mummy”  or  “OK  baby  you  get  into  the 
carriage  and I will  push  you”. Role  assignment  was not  coded  if  a child 
was  playing  at  being  someone,  as  evidenced  by  their  dress,  actions,  or 
change  in  voice,  but  the  child  never  explicitly  said  who  they  were 
pretending to be  [inter-rater reliability  was r( 1 1)  = 0.891. 

RESULTS 

The aim of this study was to examine whether children who show greater 
false belief  understanding  on the basis of experimental  tasks demonstrate 
different  sorts of  competencies  in  naturalistic  settings  than  children  who 
show  less  false  belief  understanding.  Children  were  assigned  by  their 
teachers  to  pretend  play  groups,  based  on  availability  at  the  time  of 
filming.  In  order  to  ensure  that  results  were  not  based  on  false  belief 
scores  of  other  children  in  the  pretend  play  group,  a  variable  was 
constructed  which  was  the  sum  of  the  false  belief  scores  of  the  other  2 
or 3 children  in the  group minus  that of  the  target child.  This effectively 
took  account  of  the  level  of  false  belief  understanding  in  the  group  of 
children that played  together. We examined  whether this affected pretend 
play  scores; it was  not  found to be  significant  in  any  analyses  and  is  not 
reported  further.  We  also  examined  the  effect  of  sex  on  false  belief, 
language  ability,  empathic  concern,  pretend  play,  joint  proposals,  and 
role  assignment.  The  child’s  sex  was  not  significantly  associated  with 
any variables and was not entered  in any  subsequent analyses.

Considering first  the  children’s performance on  the  false belief  tasks: 
95% of  the control tasks were passed by the children, indicating that they 
were  well  able  to  remember  the  stories  and  materials  and  to  answer 
questions  about  them.  Given  that  almost  all  the  control  questions  were 
passed this was not entered as a covariate in any analyses. We did not find 
that  any  one  task  was  consistently  harder  than  the  others  (Jenkins  & 
Astington,  submitted). In  the  larger  sample  of  children  from  which  the 
current  sample  was  drawn  the  means  and  standard  deviations  of  the 
children’s ages (in months) for those who pass each task are  as follows: 
change in location story 1: mean = 52.8, SD = 6.6, change in location story 
2:  mean = 52.4,  SD = 6.6, unexpected contents: mean  = 53.1, SD = 6.5, 
unexpected picture: mean = 53.0, SD = 6.8. The intercorrelation between 
these different tasks was found to be sufficiently strong for us to argue that 
some common underlying  skill  is  being  measured. When  the  four  tasks 
were summed the internal consistency of  the measure is high (a = 0.85). 
The total score on all four false belief tasks is the measure used throughout 
the remainder of  the paper. 

Means and  standard deviations for the false belief  score, the  language 
ability score, empathic concern, and the pretend play variables can be seen 
in Table 1. As the empathic concern, pretend play, joint proposals, and role 
assignment  scores  were  all  proportional  measures,  an  arc  sine 
transformation was used for all subsequent data analyses. 

Table 2 shows the Pearson product moment correlations between false 
belief understanding, age, language ability, the measure of  empathic con- 
cern, and the three pretend play variables. The empathic rating of concern 
towards other children and the amount of pretend play were not associated 
with  false  belief  understanding. False  belief  understanding  was  signifi- 
cantly  associated  with  age,  language  ability,  children’s joint  proposals, 
and role assignments in pretend play. 

It  is  important  to  determine  whether  the  associations  between  false 
belief  understanding and joint  proposals,  and  false  belief  understanding

and role assignments, depend on the known relation between false belief 
task  performance, age,  and  linguistic competence (Jenkins & Astington, 
submitted). The left half  of  Table 3 shows the correlation of  false belief 
understanding with the measure of empathic concern and the three pretend 
play  variables, after  partialling out  the effects  of  age.  The  right  half  of 
Table  3  shows the  correlation  of  false  belief  understanding  with  these

children’s joint  proposals  and  role  assignments after  taking  account  of 
the effect of  age, and  also after taking account of  the  effect  of  age and 
language ability. The greater the children’s understanding of  false belief 
the greater their generation of joint proposals and the greater the frequency 
with  which  they  explicitly  assign roles  in  pretend  play  interaction. This

competence. 

DISCUSSION 

The important finding was that  of  an association between the  laboratory 
measure  of  children’s  false  belief  understanding  and  their  behaviour 
observed in a naturalistic setting. This relationship was not accounted for 
by  the  children’s  age  or  language  ability.  Children  who  showed higher 
levels  of  false  belief  understanding  were  more  likely  to  make  joint 
proposals  in  their  pretend  play,  and  they  made  explicit  pretend  role 
assignments  to  themselves  and  other  children  with  greater  frequency. 
Thus, we  can conclude that false belief understanding is associated with 
certain real world behaviours in children. This result makes it unlikely that 
the acquisition of false belief understanding around 4 years of age is merely 
a  methodological  artifact,  seriously  underestimating  younger  children’s 
competence  (Chandler,  1988).  As  performance  on  false  belief  tasks  is 
related  to  real  world  behaviours,  it  is  likely  that  the  tasks  are  charting 
meaningful change in children’s cognitive development. 

How  can  we  understand  the  association  between  false  belief  under- 
standing  and  children’s  production  of  joint  proposals  in  pretend  play? 
Joint  proposals  were  operationalised in  terms  of  children  offering  plans 
for themselves and another child in one speaker turn. Plans had to do with 
actions, roles, desires, and  so on, not directly with  beliefs, but  the  act of 
offering an explicit joint plan acknowledges that the self and the other may 
not  have  the  same  understanding  of  the  pretend  situation.  That  is,  as 
Schmidt  and  Marsella  (1991)  point  out,  successful joint  planning  may 
depend  on  representing  the  sometimes  differing  and  conflicting  beliefs 
and  goals  the  other  person  has  about  the  situation.  Thus,  as  children 
acquire  a  certain  level  of  skill  in  understanding  the  beliefs  of  another 
person  as  measured  through  laboratory  tasks  they  also  demonstrate  an 
increased  ability  to  cooperate  in  joint  activity  in  an  indeterminate  (i.e. 
pretend)  situation,  making  explicit  their  own  plans  for  themselves  and 
their  playmates.  This  relationship  was  not  explained just  by  increasing 
skill in general language development. 

It is also clear from these data that children with higher levels of  false 
belief  understanding  are  more  likely  to  assign  an  explicit  role  or  role 
change for themselves or a partner. Only explicit assignments were coded 
on the grounds that  a child who could represent others’ beliefs would be 
more likely to communicate explicitly, knowing that  otherwise the  com- 
munication might fail. Thus, the relationship we found between children’s 
false belief scores and their joint proposals and role assignments confirms 

THEORY  OF  MIND

our hypothesis that children with a more developed understanding of false 
belief  will  be  more  aware  that  they  and  their  play  partners  may  have 
different  beliefs  about  the  non-existent  pretend  world,  and  will  be  more 
likely  to make explicit to their  partners their ideas for plans  and roles  in 
that world. 

We did not  find an association between  false belief  understanding  and 
the  amount of  pretend  play  a  child  was  involved  in.  A  limitation  of  the 
study is the fact that the children’s pretend play was observed on only one 
occasion for  a period  of  about  ten  minutes.  It  may  well  be  that,  even  if 
children with a more developed theory of mind do engage in more pretend 
play, they did not happen to do so in the ten minutes we observed them. It 
is  perhaps  more  likely,  however,  that  the  amount  of  pretend  play  is  not 
influenced by false belief understanding,  but the quality of the play is. It is 
notable that even in the ten minute observation period, children with higher 
levels  of  false  belief  understanding  were  more  likely  to  engage in  more 
sophisticated play, in that they made their pretend world more explicit for 
their play partners. 

Harris (1992) suggests that successful performance on false belief tasks 
is achieved through a process of simulation+hildren 
imagine themselves 
having the desires and beliefs that the other person has, imagine what they 
would  do  in  that  situation,  and  predict  the  other’s  actions  accordingly. 
Harris is not postulating  a causal relationship between taking on a pretend 
role and the development of false belief understanding. He is describing the 
process of  false belief  understanding  itself  as a simulation or a process of 
imagination.  In  these  data  our  hypothesis  about  a  relationship  between 
false  belief  understanding  and  pretend  play  in  general  is  not  confirmed, 
but the more precise relationship with role assignment in pretend play may 
in fact be a better indicator of the importance of simulation ability in false 
belief understanding. 

We did not  find an association between false belief  understanding  and 
empathic concern as measured by peer nominations.  Possibly this nomina- 
tion  procedure  is  not  an  adequate  means  for  determining  the  level  of 
children’s concern for others. Even if it is adequate, it may be that children 
can respond  empathically at  a behavioural  level; that  is to say, they  may 
comfort a crying friend without understanding  the mental state underlying 
the emotional reaction.  In addition or alternatively, children with a greater 
understanding  of their peers’ mental  states may not use this understanding 
to provide comfort. Awareness of others’ mental  states is also required  for 
Machiavellian  purposes,  to  annoy,  tease,  and  deceive  others  (Astington, 
1993). On the other hand, given Dunn’s (this issue) finding that children’s 
understanding  of  beliefs  and  their  understanding  of  emotions  appear  to 
develop relatively  independently, perhaps one should not expect to find an 
association  between  a  cognitive  and  an  affective  measure  such  as  false 

162  ASTINGTON AND JENKINS 

belief understanding and empathic concern. We discuss this point further 
later. 

What can we speculate about the direction of  causality involved in our 
findings?  This  study  was  designed  and  the  data  analysed  around  the 
premise  that  the  acquisition  of  false  belief  understanding  would  have 
consequences for children’s ability  to  interact  with  other people  and  for 
the quality of their pretend play. However, it is not possible to confirm such 
a  causal  pathway,  given  the  cross-sectional  nature  of  these  data.  One 
possible  causal  pathway  is  that  false  belief  understanding  leads  to  the 
ability  to  generate joint  plans  and  make  explicit  role  assignments.  We 
should note that children with no understanding of  false belief did make 
some joint  proposals and role  assignments, although less frequently than 
children with higher levels of  false belief understanding. We propose that 
children  sometimes do  these  things  without  understanding  others’  false 
beliefs,  but  the  acquisition of  false  belief  understanding makes  children 
more likely to see the need to do so in the ambiguous context of  pretend 
play. An alternative causal model is that practice in generating joint plans 
and  making  role  assignments  leads  to  the  development  of  false  belief 
understanding.  It  may  be  that  engaging  in  pretend  play  helps  children 
become  more  aware  of  the  opacity  of  mental  states  generally.  A  third 
hypothesis is that joint  planning and role  assignment are related to  false 
belief  understanding,  involve  similar  skills,  and  follow  a  similar 
developmental  trajectory,  although  they  are  not  causally  linked  to  one 
another. 

We  have  provided  evidence  of  a  relation  between  theory  of  mind 
development,  as  measured  by  an  experimental  task,  and  social  under- 
standing in a naturalistic setting. In future research of  this kind  it will be 
important  to  design  studies  in  which  the  direction  of  effects  can  be 
examined. These studies should take the form of  naturalistic observations 
over a period of  time, combined with intervention studies (Bryant,  1990). 
Such investigations are urgently needed in order to provide data to inform 
the debate over causal explanations of  children’s acquisition of  a theory of 
mind (Astington, 1993, ch. 10). This is a fundamental issue, which is vastly 
more important than questions of  whether 3-year-olds can or cannot pass 
false belief tasks, and if  they do or do not possess a theory of mind. 

Whether  or  not  we  favour  the  argument that  children  develop  social 
understanding via theory construction, it is obvious that this understanding 
(or this theory) is acquired gradually from infancy onwards. It may indeed 
be a mistake to think of  it as all of  a piece, a monolithic understanding of 
other people. Our ways of understanding and interpreting human action and 
interaction are  likely  to  reflect the  complexity  and  variability  of  human 
activity.  It  may  be  the  case  that  different  aspects  of  this  understanding 
develop  in  different  ways.  Indeed,  as  Dunn  (this  issue) has  shown, two 

THEORY  OF  MIND 

163 

domains of social understanding-understanding 
beliefs and understanding 
emotions-are  not significantly correlated with one another at 40 months of 
age, and they have different patterns  of  correlates  later on. This is a very 
important finding, which provides the first empirical support for Astington 
and Gopnik’s (1991) suggestion that different  kinds of explanation  might 
be needed  for different  aspects of  theory  of  mind  development.  Children 
might come to  understand  representation  and belief  through  a process  of 
theory  construction,  they  might  come  to  understand  motivational  states 
through a process of enculturation, they might understand emotional states 
through introspective experience, or their understanding might be based on 
innate interactional abilities (Astington & Gopnik,  1991, p. 25). As Dunn 
and Brown (1944, p.  135) say, “it is important that we should not think of 
‘socio-emotional understanding’ as an undifferentiated whole, but examine 
separately children’s growing sophistication in different  realms”. 

This is not to suggest that our investigations of the different possibilities 
in these different areas should proceed in isolation, just that the picture of 
development may well be complex. The best way for us to comprehend this 
complexity will be by  integration of our efforts. Feldman  ( 1992) applauds 
the  growth  of  the  field  of  children’s  theory  of  mind,  referring  to it  as a 
paradigm  shift  in  developmental  studies  that  situates  the  thinking  child 
within the context of human culture. She argues against the idea with which 
we  began  this  paper,  that  theory  of  mind  researchers  are  pursuing  a 
Piagetian research  programme,  one that  focuses on children’s  conception 
of  psychological  rather  than  of  physical  states.  She warns that,  with  this 
stance,  the  theory  of  mind  research  programme  might  degenerate  into  a 
trivial dialogue about the age at which children can pass false belief  tasks. 
To avoid this danger she advocates that we take seriously the idea that the 
human mind is a cultural construction. This does not mean that there is no 
cognitive  development  for  us  to investigate.  Children  do indeed  develop 
new  ways  of  understanding  as  they  get  older,  but  there  is  a  two-way 
interaction  between  the  child  and  the  social  world.  Children  come  to 
understand  the  social  world  while  at  the  same  time  that  world  itself 
provides  the  material  on  which  they  operate.  An  understanding  of 
children’s development  within,  and their conceptions  of  this  social world 
will best  be  achieved  through  the  collaborative  efforts  of  ethologists  and 
experimenters.
