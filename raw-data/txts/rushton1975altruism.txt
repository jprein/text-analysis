The study examined the interrelationships  between  a number of  age-related  cognitive tasks 
and three different behavioural measures of altruism  in 60 7- and  I I-year-olds.  The cogni- 
tive tasks included  measures of  role-taking  ability,  egocentricity, cognitive complexity,  and 
conservation. I t  was intended to assess (a) the notion of generalized cognitive developmental 
levels,  (6)  the  generality  of  altruistic  behaviour,  and  (c) the  degree  to  which  cognitive- 
developmcntal  level  predicted  altruistic  behaviour.  As  expected,  highly  significant  age 
differences were found on all cognitive tasks. Eleven-year-olds  were also significantly more 
altruistic  than  were  seven-year-olds.  Although  some  generality  emerged  across  altruistic 
behaviours,  no such generalities emerged either between the cognitivc measures themselves 
or between  the cognitive  measures  and altruism.  Some of  the implications of  the findings 
are discussed. 
Children’s generosity appears to increase reliably with age, at least over the period 
of  middle  childhood  (i.e.  6-12)  (Elliott  & Vasta,  1970; Emler  & Rushton,  1974; 
Handlon  & Gross,  1959; Midlarsky  & Bryan,  1967; Ugurel-Semin,  1952). This 
age  period  is also  a time of  change  in such cognitive-developmental  processes as 
moral judgement (Piaget,  1932) and role-taking (Flavell,  1968), both of which have 
been  hypothesized  to  underlie  the age  changes  in  generosity (Bryan  & London, 
1970; Rosenhan,  1969, 1972; Wright,  1971). Some recent  research has suggested 
that this might indeed be the case. Thus Emler & Rushton (1974) found a relation- 
ship between the child’s maturity of  moral judgement and the amount of  sharing 
behaviour  evidenced.  Some support for  a replication  of  this finding was  demon- 
strated  in  a  subsequent study  (Rushton,  1975). Rubin  & Schneider  (1973) also 
found a relationship between moral judgement and measures of ‘ helping behaviour ’ 
in young children. These latter authors also found a relationship bctwcen  a child’s 
altruism and a measure of  ‘ decentration ’ - a measure conceptually similar to ‘ role- 
taking ability’. Thus the idea of changes in cognitive development underlying the 
age relationship with generosity has received support. On the other hand, Emler & 
Rushton  (1974) failed  to  find  relationships  between  two  different  measures  of 
role-taking  ability and generosity.  One of the purposes of the present research was 
to explore further the role of  cognitive-developmental  variables in accounting for 
the generosity of children. 

Thc underlying  rationale for the investigations  cited was based on the view that 
the  different  cognitivc  levels  of  development  that  a  child  passes  through  should 
be  predictors  of  the  child’s  behaviour  on  relevant  tasks.  Or,  in  the  words  of 
Kohlberg (1969), ‘A given  stage-response  on  a  task.. .represents an underlying 
thought  organization. . .which  determines  responses  to  tasks  which  are  not

manifestly  similar’  (pp.  352-353).  Such  a  viewpoint  often  finds  expression  in 
the literature  on cognitive development.  For  example,  ‘ . . .a  child  of  eight who 
possesses  the  grouping  structure  will,  by  implication  from  the  structure,  show 
reversibility  of  thought, a relative lack of  egocentrism,  a capacity for synthesizing 
rather than simply juxtaposing data, and a number of other characteristics (Flavell, 
1963, p. 18) and ‘The transitions with which we shall be concerned, are interesting 
in their  own right as a documentary  on development. More interesting still is the 
picture of the underlying form of organization in thought that is revealed’ (Olver & 
Hornsby,  1966, p. 69). 

Thus  the  overall  assumption  is  that  children  who  differ  in  their  underlying 
cognitive  structure (level) should  show  systematic,  corresponding  differences  in 
their intellectual and social behaviours.  It still remains to be determined, however, 
whether  there  are such generalized levels in cognitive  development. Most  studies 
tend  to  explore  one  area  of  development  at  a  time  and  little  attempt is  made 
empirically to demonstrate  the degree  of  interrelationships  between  areas of  cog- 
nitive functioning. The present study was designed to do just this using a battery 
of  established cognitive tasks. 

A further area of  concern  involves the present  controversy  as to whether  social 
behaviours  show  generality  across  situations,  or  are  situation  specific  (Mischel, 
1968,  1973). A cognitive-developmental  approach to altruistic behaviour  assumes 
that  there  are reasonable  generalities  across  situations.  If  this  were  not  the  case 
there would be little reason  to look for such generalized  cognitive-developmental 
precursors  of  generosity  as role-taking  ability and moral judgement.  The present 
study  used  three  behavioural  measures  of  altruism  in  order  to  investigate  this 
question further. 

Thus the study reported  here aimed  (a) to explore further the role of  cognitive 
developmental  variables  in  accounting  for  the generosity  of  children;  (b)  to test 
the  notion  of  ‘generalized  levels’  in cognitive  development;  and  (c)  to  examine 
generalities across altruistic behaviours. 

Subjects 

M E T H O D  

Thirty 7-year-olds and thirty I I -year-olds, divided evenly between the sexes, participated 
in the study. They were drawn, with equal numbers, from five predominantly lower middle- 
class primary  schools in Hertfordshire.  The National Foundation for Educational Research 
(NFER) Intelligence Test No.  3, both verbal and non-verbal forms, was administered,  and 
showed the sample to be of  average ability (verbal  IQ: mean 7  = 99.9, S.D.  = 11.8; mean 
1 1   = 106.6, S.D.  = 14.6; non-verbal  IQ: mean  7  = 104.3,  S.D.  = 15.7; mean  1 1   = 109.6, 
S.D.  = 13.5). 

Procedure 

A battery of  ten measures - seven ‘cognitive’  and three ‘ behavioural’ - was taken  from 
thc children,  all of  whom were tested individually.  The study was conducted  in two class- 
rooms made available in each school, one for the cognitive measures and the other for the 
behavioural.  Three experimenters  were used: a male and a female graduate student, and a 
male  undergraduate. The subject  was  sent  to  the  experimental  room by the  teacher  and 
was met by the female experimenter,  who established rapport. She told the child, ‘We are 
designing  some  games  for children  and would  like  your  help.’  The cognitive  tasks  were 

Altruism and  Cognitive Development

administered  first, their order being randomized.  This took about 40 min.,  following which 
the subject was given  ‘a chance to win  a prize  for being  so good’.  The subject went with 
the experimenter to the other room  where  he went through  the behavioural  tasks.  These 
followed the same order each time and took  15 min. 

Instruments 

A. Cognitive tasks. 
(I) Role-taking  task:  Board  game  (from Flavell,  1968, pp.  82-102).  The  subject  was 
shown non-verbally  how  to play  a snake-and-ladders  type  of  game.  His task was  then  to 
explain  in  his  own  words  the  rules of  the  game  first  to  the  second  experimenter sitting 
opposite  him  ordinarily  and  then  to  the second  experimenter sitting opposite  him  blind- 
folded.  H e  was  told  to modify  his  explanation  on the second  occasion to take  account  of 
the fact  that  the experimenter could no longer see the board and counters.  The degree to 
which  the  subject was  able  to  do this  was  employed  as  his  score  of  role-taking  ability. 
Scores, which ranged  from o  to  20, were  based  on the difference  between  the amount of 
worthwhile  information given on the first occasion from that given on the second. 
( 2 )  Role-taking  task: Cylinders  (from Flavell,  1968, pp. 55-70). This task was  designed 
to  assess  ‘perceptual’  role-taking  skill.  I t  measured  the  subject’s  ability  to  predict  the 
appearance  of  a  stimulus  display  from  a  perspective  other  than  his  own.  Subjects were 
shown a series of four stimulus displays and were asked to reconstruct  each one as it would 
look  to  the  second  experimenter seated  at  different  vantage  points  v i s - h i s  the  display. 
Scores could range from o to 36. 
(3)  Conservation task  (from Bruner  et al., 1966). A standard liquid conservation  task was 
given to the subject to discover if he could conserve liquid and, if so, to examine the reasons 
he gave.  Four such tasks were given.  Since all children  could  conserve  scoring was based 
on  the reasons given using  Bruner’s  (1966,  p.  235)  developmentally ordered justifications 
for conservation : perceptual,  direct-action, and transformational. These are ordered accord- 
ing to the degree to which they reflect immediate phenomenal or perceptual  features of the 
situation.  Scores could range from 4 to 12. 

(4)  Person perception  photo-grouping  task  (adapted from  Olver  €9 Hornsby,  1966). The 
subject was  presented  with a display of  15 colour photographs of  different people  to sort. 
The grouping strategies adopted were scored according to Olver & Hornsby’s (1966) adapt- 
ation of Bruner’s (1966) developmental scheme. This was based on the degree to which they 
reflect  the immediate  perceptual features  of  the stimuli: (i) perceptual, in which  items are 
rendered equivalent on the basis of immediate phenomenal qualities ; (ii) functional, in which 
items are rendered equivalent  on the basis  of  the function of  items;  and (iii) symbolic,  in 
which items are rendered equivalent on the basis of non-sensory  ideas like relations between 
quantities. 

(5) Cognitive simplicity-cognitive complexity measure. On the basis of the person  perception 
photo grouping task just cited, the number of pair groupings were counted.  Such a grouping 
strategy  has  previously  been shown to decline with  age (Olver  & Hornsby,  1966) and has 
been said to reflect the degree of  the child’s ‘cognitive complexity’. 

(6)  Person  perception Kelly-Grid-type-construct  task  (devised by J. Wiener ). The subject 
was asked to describe five significant other people in his life by grouping the five in groups 
of  three.  For each group, the subject was asked  to think of  three ways in which  any two 
people in the group were similar, but different from the third. These constructs were coded 
on the basis  of  the same three  developmental  categories  used  for the  photo-sorting  task, 
i.e.  perceptual,  functional  and  symbolic.  The subject’s  cognitive-developmental  score  on 
this task was based  on thc number of  constructs falling into the symbolic category. 

(7)  Egocentricity  score.  The constructs generated  by the above  measure were  scored for 
signs  of  egocentricity.  This was  a  yes/no  categorization  based  on  whether  the  construct 
was made with direct reference  to the subject.  The subject’s  egocentricity score consisted 
of the absolute number of  egocentric statements out of  the 30 possible. 

B. Behaviourul  tasks. 
(8) Competitive  racing  game  (adapted from Rutherford  & Mussen,  1968). In ten  races, 
the child  raced  a toy car against  the experimenter’s  car along  a  3 ft.  ‘track’ on the floor. 

J. P H I L I P P E  RUSHTON A N D   JANET WIENER 

344 
This track was marked off  in inches.  The competition was  ‘to see who can get to the end 
of  the track  first’.  The experimenter  moved  his  car at a constant,  moderatrly slow speed, 
and  the  child  could  win  or lose  the  race  with  a  large  or small margin  of  victory.  In no 
instance  did  the  subject  permit the  experimenter  to win.  The competitiveness  score was 
the subject’s average margin of  victory for the ten races, expressed in inches. ‘Competitive- 
ness’ scores ranged from  2 to 31 in. 

(9)  Generosity to a charity  (Roseahan & White, 1967). The subject played on an electronic 
bowling  game from which  he won  tokens later exchangeable for prizes on the basis  of  the 
more  tokens  won,  the  better  the prize  given.  At  the  same time  the  subjcct  was given  an 
opportunity to donate,  anonymously, some  of  his  winnings  to  ‘Bobby’, a small  boy  on  a 
‘Save the  Children Fund’ poster.  The number of  tokens  donated  (out of  a  possible  16) 
constituted thc generosity score on this measurc. 

(10)  Generosity to a friend  (from Rutherford  & Mussen,  1968). The  subject  exchanged 
however  many tokens  he  had left for ‘a prize’,  in this case, 24 swects. He was  then given 
two paper bags. On one was written his name, and on the other the name of his best friend. 
The subject was told he could put all the sweets in his own bag if he wished, it really didn’t 
matter, but if he wished  to give any to his friend  he could  do so in the bag provided.  The 
experimenter  then left the room.  As  the subject came to leave the room with  the two bags 
of sweets, the cxperimenter  suggested  to him that he leave the bags on a nearby shelf until 
the end of the day. The number of  sweets given to the friend, out of  the possible 24, consti- 
tuted the generosity score. 

R E S U L T S  

A random sample of  25  per cent of the interviews were scored by a second coder. 
Inter-coder  agreement  for  the  seven  cognitive-developmental  measures  ranged 
from 87 to 99 pcr  cent. 

Means  and  standard deviations  of  the various  tasks  were  computed separately 

for the two age groups. These are presented  in Table  I .

In order to assess the effects of  age, sex, verbal  IQ and non-verbal  IQ on these 
tasks,  product-moment  correlations  were  computed.  Since  age  was  significantly 
related to verbal IQ (r = 0.25 ; P < 0.05) and marginally related to non-verbal  I Q  
(r = 0.18; P < O ~ I O ) ,  age was partialled  out of  the analysis with  IQ. The results 
are shown in Table 2. 

From Table 2 it can be seen that there were highly significant age differences on 
all tasks,  both cognitive and  behavioural.  On the cognitive tasks  this meant that 
older  children  were  more  advanced,  and on the  behavioural  tasks  it  meant  that

Altruism and Cognitive Development

older  children  were  both  more  generous  and  more  competitive.  Significant IQ 
differences were found on three of  the cognitive tasks with high IQs scoring higher 
than  low  IQs.  This was  true  for  both  verbal  and  non-verbal  IQ  which  inter- 
correlated r  = 0.73 ( P  < 0.001).

(Age partialled out of analyses with IQ.) 

* P  < 0.05.  ** P < 0'01.  *** P  < 0'001. 

The purpose of  the study was to determine the intercorrelations between (a) the 
cognitive  tasks,  (b) the  behavioural  tasks,  and  (c)  the  cognitive tasks  with  the 
behavioural.  For  this  purpose,  a  correlation  matrix  was  computed  for  all  the 
variables. Since Table 2 had indicated highly significant correlations between thc 
tasks  and age and IQ,  these  last  two variables were partialled out of  the analysis 
to  allow  an  unconfounded  examination  of  the  relationships  between  the  other 
variables. This correlation matrix is shown in Table 3. 
While  23 of  the 45 correlations were significant at  beyond  the P < 0.05 level 
when  the cffects of  age and  IQ were not  partialled  out,  only five remained  once 
the cffects of  age and verbal  IQ had been partialled out.  Of  these five, two were 
intercorrelations  between  cognitive  tasks,  one  was  between  a  cognitive  and  a 
behavioural task, and two were between behavioural tasks. Generosity to a friend 
related positively (Y  = 0.24; P < 0.05) with generosity to a charity, and negatively 
(Y  =  -0.55;  P < 0.001) with competitiveness. 
T o  ascertain whether the degree of  interrelatedness varied by age, two separate 
matrices  were  computed,  one  for  each  age.  These  are  shown  in  Table  4. Five 
significant correlations were obtained for the younger age group, and eight for the 
older group. Only two were common to both age groups. The correlations do not 
reveal any pattern, or any obvious reason why they should exist at one age but not 
the other. Nor can it be maintained that with increasing age there is an increasing 
generality found in cognitive functioning.

J. PHILIPPE RUSHTON A N D   J A N E T   WIENER 

DISCUSSION 

This study  very  strongly  supports the  large  body  of  previous  research  demon- 
strating that the cognitions and behaviour of  a 7-year-old are significantly different 
from those of  an 11-year-old. This is exactly what one would expect in adopting 
a  cognitive-developmental approach  to  study  middle  childhood.  However,  one 
would, in addition, expect to find some degree of correlation between the cognitions 
and behaviours within each group (Bruner et  al., 1966; Flavell, 1963; Kohlberg, 
1969). In this study, however, which concentrated on the social domain, virtually 
no  interrelationships  between age-related tasks were found.  When  the  effects of 
age and IQ were partialled out, children who were high scorers on one role-taking 
task did not necessarily score highly on either of the two person-perception  tasks, 
the conservation task, the behavioural tasks, or even the second role-taking task. 
The very small number of  intercorrelations involving the cognitive tasks were not 
common for both 7-  and 11-year-olds and are best treated  as chance occurrences. 
It would seem that,  in the domain of  person  perception  and altruistic behaviour 
at least, these results call into question the notion of generalized cognitive develop- 
mental levels mediating behavioural and cognitive repertoires. 

It is possible, of  course, that the lack of  interrelationships  is due to the nature 
of the particular tasks used. It might be argued that, although these tasks are age- 
related, they are not mediated by any known ‘organizational structures’ or ‘schema’ 
or ‘stage’ and therefore  relationships between  them  need  not  be  expected.  Yet, 
since organizational structure can only be inferred in the first place from age-related 
overt  behaviour  and  since we  have  used  demonstrably  significant age-correlated 
tasks, this argument loses some of  its cogency. In the absence of further evidence, 
therefore,  we  must  conclude that  the  notion  of  ‘generalized levels ’ in  cognitive 
development is not supported by the data. 

The lack of  relationship between the cognitive and the behavioural measures in 
this  study  casts doubt  on  the hypothesis  that  some general  change in  cognitive 
development mediates the age changes consistently found in altruistic behaviour. 
Specifically, it replicates the  negative findings of  Emler  & Rushton  (1974) with 
respect to the widely held view that role-taking abilities are necessary prerequisites 
for  generosity  (Rosenhan,  1969,  1972;  Wright,  1971).  Previous  research  has 
suggested that moral judgement relates to a child’s altruistic behaviour (Emler & 
Rushton,  1974; Rubin  & Schneider,  1973).  Further  research  is required  to  see 
whether  the  moral judgement  relationship  with  altruistic behaviour  is  a spec@ 
relationship  or whether it is part of  a more general cognitive developmental pro- 
cess. The evidence from this study must suggest the former. 

The  correlations  found  between  the  behavioural  tasks  are  of  interest.  The 
evidence reported  here  replicates that  of  Rutherford  & Mussen (1968) who also 
found  relations  between  behavioural  generosity  and  other  ‘ pro-social’  charac- 
teristics  in  children.  Present  evidence then  suggests the possibility that  there  is 
some  generalization of  altruistic behaviour.  However, the  size and  patterning  of 
the correlations are not impressive. The negative correlations between competitive- 
ness and  generosity to  a friend  declined sharply  from  the  7-  to  the  11-year-old

samples,  and  there  was  no  significant  correlation  between  competitiveness  and 
generosity  to  a  charity.  Furthermore,  the  correlation  of  +024 (for  both  ages 
combined)  between  generosity  to a friend and generosity  to a charity indicates of 
course,  only  6  per  ccnt  of  shared  variance.  The value  of  searching  further  for 
generalized  cognitivc  development  antecedents  of  ‘ dispositions’  of  the  strength 
found in this study may thcreforc be questioned. 

The authors would  like to thank  Tim Oake  for his  kind  help  with the collection  of  data.
