The purpose of this study was threefold: (a) to examine change in prosocial moral judgment over a
7-year period, (b) to determine whether there are gender differences in the development of prosocial
moral judgment, and (c) to examine the  interrelations of moral judgment, affect  (empathy), and
behavior in middle childhood. Participants were two groups of children who have been followed for
5 and 7 years and two groups of children interviewed for the first time at either ages 9-10 or 11-12.
Hedonistic reasoning decreased with age; simple needs-oriented  moral judgments increased with
age and  then  leveled off;  most other  more sophisticated  types of reasoning increased  in a linear
fashion with age. Modes of reasoning that most explicitly reflect  role taking or empathy increased
in use with age for girls but not for boys. Empathy was positively related to needs-oriented judgments
and to higher-level prosocial reasoning and was negatively related to hedonistic reasoning (depending
on the age of the children). Empathy was positively related to donating at  11-12 years of age but not
at 9-10  years of age. Relations between behavior and reasoning varied depending on the structure
and costs of a specific behavior. The results are discussed in relation to theory and research concern-
ing developmental change in moral reasoning and possible mediators of prosocial development.

The roles of affect  and cognition  in morality  have been de-
bated  frequently.  Some  psychologists  (e.g..  Kohlberg,  1984}
have claimed that cognition and rationality are central to mo-
rality and that the role of affect is minimal. Others have asserted
that affect,  especially empathy  and sympathy, often  functions
as  a  motive  for  moral  behavior  (Batson,  in  press;  Hoffman,
1984). In recent work, the role of each has been acknowledged
(e.g., Eisenberg,  1986; Hoffman,  in press; Staub, 1979).

Moral judgment  is one  type  of  cognitive  process generally
viewed as affecting  moral behavior, including prosocial behav-
ior (Eisenberg,  1986; Underwood & Moore,  1982). According
to a cognitive developmental perspective, the quality of a proso-
cial action, that is, the maturity of reasoning underlying an act,
is believed to change as the individual develops the capacity for
higher-level  moral  judgment;  moreover,  mature  moral  judg-
ment  is presumed  to  be  somewhat  positively associated  with
quantity  of prosocial  behavior  (Blasi,  1980; Eisenberg,  1986;
Underwood & Moore, 1982).

Researchers interested in the development of moral reasoning
frequently  have examined reasoning about moral conflicts  in-

volving  issues related  to rules, laws, authorities' dictates, and
formal obligations (see Kohlberg,  1984; Rest,  1983). However,
moral conflicts relating primarily to altruistic behavior—when
one person's needs, wants, or desires conflict with those of an-
other in situations in which the roles of authorities, rules and
punishment,  and  formal  obligations are minimal—have been
examined much less frequently (see Eisenberg, 1986).

In  the  existing  cross-sectional  research,  researchers  have
noted  an  age-related  sequence  of development  for  children's
prosocial moral reasoning. Unlike for prohibition-oriented rea-
soning, young children apparently use little authority and pun-
ishment-oriented  reasoning to justify  moral  decisions; rather,
they verbalize much  hedonistic and needs-oriented  (primitive
empathic)  reasoning.  In  elementary  school,  children's judg-
ments begin to reflect approval-oriented considerations and the
desire  to  behave in  stereotypically  "good"  ways.  In  contrast,
high-school  students  frequently  verbalize  reasoning  reflecting
abstract principles, internalized affective reactions (e.g., guilt or
positive affect relating to living up to one's principles), and self-
reflective empathy as well as other less advanced forms of delib-
eration  (Eisenberg,  Lennon,  &  Roth,  1983;  Eisenberg-Berg,
1979; see Eisenberg,  1986). Unfortunately, most of the original
work on prosocial moral reasoning has been cross-sectional or
has involved  only one age group; thus, it has been  impossible
to determine the degree to which the aforementioned  changes
in children's reasoning have reflected cohort effects or are devel-
opmental advances.

Thus far, the development of prosocial behavior has been ex-
amined  longitudinally  from  ages 4-5  to  7-8  (Eisenberg et al.,
1983;  Eisenberg-Berg  &  Roth,  1980).  One  of  the  primary
purposes of this research was to chart further the development
of prosocial moral judgment throughout middle childhood into
early adolescence, using a longitudinal method. By doing so, we

PROSOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT  IN  MIDDLE CHILDHOOD

713

hoped to ascertain whether prosocial reasoning develops in the
manner suggested by the limited cross-sectional research.

The second purpose of this work was to examine the possibil-
ity of the emergence of a gender difference  in reasoning in early
adolescence. There  is an  ongoing debate  concerning  the exis-
tence and  form  of any gender differences  in  moral  reasoning
(e.g.,  Baumrind,  1986; Walker,  1984). Gilligan  (1977,  1982)
and some (e.g., Gibbs, Arnold, & Burkhart,  1984) have found
that  female adolescents and adults are more likely than  males
to focus on  issues related to caring and human  needs in their
moral reasoning. Such a gender difference  has not been  found
in  prior  work concerning  younger  children's  prosocial  moral
reasoning (see Eisenberg,  1986); however, the gender differences
noted by Gilligan might emerge in early adolescence as gender
roles  consolidate.  In  the  one  cross-sectional  study  of  moral
judgment  in adolescence, no gender difference  in overall level
of reasoning was found  (Eisenberg-Berg,  1979); however, Eise-
nberg (1977) did note that female adolescents verbalized more
concern with others' psychological needs and sympathy, and fo-
cused  more on  others' status as human  beings than  did  male
adolescents. Thus, it is reasonable to predict the emergence of
a gender difference  in empathic, care-related  reasoning in ad-
olescence.

The third purpose of this study was to examine the interrela-
tion of prosocial moral judgment and prosocial behavior at two
ages (9-10 and 11-12 years). Although there appears to be some
empirical  association  between  moral judgment  and  prosocial
behavior (Eisenberg, 1986; Underwood & Moore, 1982), the as-
sociation  has been  neither  strong  nor  highly  consistent.  This
may be for at least two reasons. First, some prosocial actions,
especially those that  are low in cost, often  may be  performed
with  little conscious cognitive processing,  moral  or otherwise
(Eisenberg & Shell,  1986; Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz,  1978)
and thus are not really moral. Consequently, one would not ex-
pect low-cost prosocial acts to be related to maturity of moral
judgment. Second, researchers usually have examined the asso-
ciation  between  behavior  and  composite  indices  of judgment
that do not clearly reflect all the various types of reasoning used
by the individual. It is likely that different  moral (or nonmoral)
concerns that are expressed as part of moral reasoning—for ex-
ample, concern with self-gain or approval—relate differently to
various prosocial behaviors depending on the specific potential
costs, benefits, and norms associated with the particular behav-
ior.  For  example,  if a  specific  behavior  were  very  costly  but
would be observed by no one, one would expect that behavior
to be negatively related to hedonistic reasoning but unrelated to
approval-oriented  reasoning. By lumping measures of various
sorts of reasoning  into one index, information  about  specific
aspects of reasoning is often lost. Thus, another purpose of this
study was to examine the relation of different  prosocial behav-
iors, varying in structure and costs, with various categories of
prosocial moral judgment and to explore whether, as suggested
by some researchers (e.g., Rholes & Bailey,  1983), this relation
increases with  age. Higher-cost behaviors were expected to be
positively related to relatively mature levels of moral judgment
and other-oriented rather than to hedonistic reasoning, whereas
low-cost prosocial actions were not expected to relate to moral
judgment.

The fourth  purpose of the study was to examine the relation
of vicarious emotional  responsivity  to others (usually  labeled

empathy  or  sympathy)  to  children's  prosocial  behavior.  As
mentioned previously, empathy (an emotional reaction elicited
by and congruent with the other's emotional state or situations)
and the related affect  of sympathy (concern for the other based
primarily on empathically induced affect)  are viewed by many
theorists as important  motivators of prosocial behavior  (Hoff-
man, 1984). According to a recent review, there is some empiri-
cal support for this view (Eisenberg & Miller,  1987). The rela-
tion between measures of vicarious emotional responsivity and
prosocial behavior empathy, however, has been less consistent
and weaker in the research conducted with children than in that
conducted with adults (Eisenberg & Miller, 1987). This may be,
in part,  because  vicarious  affective  responsivity  in  childhood
generally has been assessed with measures of empathy, not sym-
pathy;  that  is, empathy  has been  operationalized  as the  ten-
dency to feel the same or similar emotions as another. Such vi-
carious experiencing may lead to personal distress (e.g., anxiety
for  the  self),  not  to  sympathetic  concern  (Batson,  in  press;
Hoffman,  1984). Researchers seldom have examined the rela-
tion between children's prosocial behavior and empathy opera-
tionalized  as involving concern  for  another as well as general
vicarious emotional  responding. Because sympathetic concern
is likely to lead to helping, one would expect a relatively close
relation  between  prosocial  action  and  measures  of  empathy
that include this aspect of vicarious reactivity.

In contrast with the relation between empathy and altruism,
the association between empathy and prosocial moral judgment
has seldom  been examined. This is despite the fact that some
researchers  have  suggested  that  sympathetic  or  empathic  re-
sponses might both stimulate the development  of internalized
moral  principles  that  reflect  a  concern  for  others'  welfare
(Hoffman,  in press) and prime the use of preexisting moral cog-
nitions reflecting concern for others (Eisenberg, 1986). The idea
that sympathetic responsiveness might enhance moral develop-
ment  has been a controversial  position  and is contrary to the
assertions of Kohlberg (1984). Thus, the fifth goal of this study
was to  examine  the  relation  of  empathy  to  prosocial  moral
judgment.

High  empathic  responding  has  been  positively  associated
with adolescents' prosocial moral judgment (Eisenberg-Berg &
Mussen,  1978). It is not clear, however, that there should be a
positive relation between level of reasoning and empathy at all
ages; level of prosocial reasoning should be positively related to
empathy only if children are at an age at which needs-oriented
or self-reflective  empathic reasoning is a relatively advanced as
well as a used level of reasoning (these two levels involve em-
pathic concerns). In addition, those specific types of prosocial
reasoning believed to involve empathic responsiveness should
be associated with empathic responsiveness at any age at which
the given category is frequently used.

When one assesses an aspect of moral development via verbal
responses,  there  is always the  possibility  that  individuals' re-
sponses will be contaminated  by self-presentational  concerns.
Thus, in this study, the relation of different  modes of moral rea-
soning to an index of need for social desirability was examined.
If self-presentational concerns do not influence children's judg-
ments, one would expect social desirability to be related only to
approval-oriented judgment.

In summary, the purposes of this study were to examine lon-
gitudinally the development of prosocial moral judgment and to

714

determine the interrelations of reasoning, prosocial  behaviors
varying in cost, and empathy  or sympathy. This was done by
conducting  5- and 7-year follow-ups  of those children  studied
by Eisenberg et al. (1983) in order to examine change in proso-
cial moral reasoning over a 7-year period as well as the interre-
lations of target variables at the ages of 9-10 and 11-12.

Subjects

Method

Four groups of middle-class children participated in this study. There
were  16 girls and  16 boys in the primary longitudinal  cohort (C,; all
Caucasian except 2).  These children  had been interviewed three times
previously, at ages 4-5,5Vi-6l/i,  and 7-8 (at 60,42, and 24 months prior
to the first assessment in this study); the five testing sessions will be re-
ferred toasTi, T2, T3, T4, andT5. The mean ages of the children atT4
and T5 were  115 months (range =  106-123 months) and  139 months
(range =  103-174 months). From T3 to T4, only  I child was lost from
the original sample; none was  lost from T4 to T5. In all,  5 have been lost
over the 7-year period.

A second longitudinal sample (C2)  consisted of 14 Caucasian children
(7 girls, 7 boys) with a mean age of 91  months at T3 (range =  85-103
months) and  115 months at T4 (i.e., 7-8 and 9-10 years, respectively).
They had been interviewed twice before: 3-4 months after the  T2 session
for the primary cohort at age 4-5 (T,)( and  1 year later, at age 5-6 (T2).
Two children were lost from  T2 to T3;  1 was lost from  T3 to T4; 5 were
lost in all.

The third  sample  (C3) consisted  of 39 fourth  graders (17  boys, 22
girls: all  Caucasian  but  6;  M  age  =117  months,  range  =  108-130
months).  These  children  attended  a  school  in  the  neighborhood  in
which the longitudinal subjects lived at the beginning of the study. They
were interviewed for the first and only time at T4. A similar group (C4)
of 31  children (11 boys, 20 girls; M age =  142 months; range  =  135-
150 months; all Caucasian but 4) were interviewed for the first and only
time at T5.

Instruments

Two  measures in this study were used previously for C,  (see Eisenberg
et  al.,  1983): four  prosocial  moral  dilemmas,  accompanied  by illus-
trations, and a measure of costly helping (children could donate part of
their earnings [eight nickels] anonymously to  UNICEF). Measures not
previously  used with CL were as follows: (a) two measures of low-cost
helping at T4 (helping an adult pick up 75 dropped paper clips for 60 s
and helping an adult pick up toys for 90 s so that other children would
not trip and  hurt themselves; latency to helping and amount  of clips
or duration  of picking up toys were measured; interrater  reliabilities
[correlations between two observers' timings of seconds for 20 to 25%
of a sample; rater was  behind a one-way mirrorl were .85 or higher); (b)
one measure of low-cost helping at T5 (helping pick up fallen papers for
60 s; latency to helping and number picked up were measured; inter-
rater reliability  was .91); (c) Bryant's (1982) 22-item  empathy scale,
which contains items pertaining to empathy and sympathy (alphas were
.60 or  higher); and  (d) CrandalFs  social  desirability  scale (SD scale;
Crandall, Crandall, & Katkovsky, 1965) for children. Composite scores
for both the entire scale (alphas were .83 or higher) and for only the  five
items relating to prosocial behaviors (alphas were .60 or higher) were
computed by summing the dichotomous scores for relevant items.

Procedures

Procedures for C,.  For C,  at T4, the interview began with the paper-
clips helping task. Next, the prosocial dilemmas were presented orally
in random order. Children repeated dilemmas to check for comprehen-
sion, and a standard sequence of questioning was followed (see Eisen-

berg et al., 1983). Subsequent to the moral interview, the children were
given the empathy measure (orally) and were allowed to anonymously
donate some of their earnings to children  in a UNICEF poster. Finally,
the second helping task (picking up toys) was administered  (except to
the five children interviewed at home). At T5, the sequencing of events
was similar, except that the first helping task involved dropped papers,
the second helping task was  omitted, and the SD  scale was  administered
either before or after  the empathy questionnaire (order was randomly
determined). The moral-reasoning task was always begun prior to the
questionnaire indices because it was  considered most crucial. Moreover,
cause and effect relations were not examined; thus the order of indices
was  considered less critical than in many experimental studies.

Procedures for  C2-  Procedures for C2 at T3 and T4 were identical to
those for Ci at T4 and T5, respectively. However, because of the small
size of the sample, only the trend analyses for moral judgment are re-
ported.

Procedures for C3.  C3 subjects were individually administered only
the prosocial  moral-judgment  stories and the empathy questionnaire.
The social-desirability  measure was subsequently  group-administered
to these children. No indices of prosocial behavior were administered
because of limitations in resources and the setting.

Procedures for C4.  C4 children were administered the same measures
as C[ at  Ts (moral  reasoning, donating, helping, empathy, SD scale),
with the exceptions that latency of helping was  not timed and the social
desirability measure was group-administered.

Scoring

Prosocial judgment stories. Scoring of prosocial reasoning was  done
in two ways. First, the children's moral judgment was coded into the
categories of reasoning outlined by Eisenberg et al. (1983). Those used
by children with any frequency  (or of particular importance) were as
follows:

Obsessive and  magical view of authority and punishments (avoidance

of punishment and unquestioning deference to power are valued in their
own right);

Hedonistic reasoning—(a) Pragmatic,  hedonistic gain to the selj"(ori-

entation to gain for oneself), (b) Direct  reciprocity (orientation to per-
sonal gain because of direct reciprocity or lack of reciprocity from the
recipient of an act), (c)  Affectional relationship {orientation to the indi-
vidual's identification with another or liking for the other);

Nonhedonisticpragmatism (orientation to practical concerns that  are

unrelated to selfish considerations);

Concern for others' needs (needs-oriented reasoning) (orientation to

the physical, material, or psychological needs of the  other person—e.g.,
"He needs blood," or "He's sad.");

Stereotypes of a good or bad  person (orientation to stereotyped im-

ages of a good or bad person);

Approval  and  interpersonal  orientation  (orientation  to  others'  ap-

proval and acceptance in deciding what is the correct behavior);

Self-reflective  empathic orientation—(a)  Sympathetic  orientations

(expression of sympathetic concern and caring for others), (b) Role-tak-
ing(the individual explicitly takes the perspective of the other);

Internalized affect—(a) Simple internalized positive affect  and posi-
tive affect related to consequences (orientation to internal positive affect
as a result of a particular course of action, often  because of the  conse-
quences of one's act for the  other person), (b)  Internalized positive affect
from  self-respect  and living up to one's values (orientation  to  feeling
good as a  result  of living up to  internalized  values), (c)  Internalized
negative affect over consequences of behavior (concern with feeling bad
or guilty because of the consequences of an  act), (d) Internalized nega-
tive affect because of loss of self-respect and  not  living up to one's values
(orientation to feeling bad as the result of not living up to internalized
values); and

internalized law. norm, and value orientation (orientation to an inter-

PROSOCIAL  DEVELOPMENT  IN  MIDDLE  CHILDHOOD

715

nalized  responsibility, duty, or  need to  uphold the laws and accepted
norms or values).

Children  were assigned  scores indicating the frequency  with which
they used each of the various types of reasoning when discussing both
the pros and cons of helping the needy other in the story dilemma (1 =
no use of that category; 4 = a major type of reasoning used). Next, the
scores for each category were summed across the stories. Interrater reli-
abilities (Pearson product-moment correlations; rs), computed for each
reasoning category  for each  cohort  at  each time, ranged  from  .79 to
1,00 (most were above .85) with the exception of three very advanced
categories that were scored  once by only the primary  coder (and are
not used in analyses) and of the infrequently  used category authority/
punishment at T5 for C, (r = .56).

The categories of reasoning are viewed as representing components
of  developmental  levels  of  prosocial  moral judgment.  They  are  de-
scribed in detail by Eisenberg et al. (1983). Briefly, the levels are as fol-
lows: Level  1, hedonistic, self-focused  orientation; Level 2, "needs of
others" orientation; Level 3, approval and interpersonal orientation and
stereotyped orientation; Level 4a, self-reflective, empathic orientation;
Level 4b, transitional level; and Level 5, strongly internalized  orienta-
tion.

A measure representing level of moral judgment was computed  for
each child. The level score was constructed in a manner similar to that
used to score Kohlbergian reasoning; subjects were assigned composite
scores by weighting the proportion of the child's reasoning at each level
(see Eisenberg etal., 1983).

Results

Age Changes in Moral Judgment

In order to examine for age changes in prosocial moral judg-
ment for C, over the 7 years, multivariate and univariate trend
analyses of variance  (MANOVAS and  ANOVAS) were computed
with  one  within-subjects  factor  (time:  5  levels)  and  one be-
tween-subjects factor (sex). The dependent variables for the first
analyses were all reasoning categories that were used by at least
one child at four or more time periods, and that had a mean of
4.75  (on a scale of 4-16) or higher for  at least one sex at one
testing  session  (i.e.,  hedonistic,  needs-oriented,  pragmatic,
direct-reciprocity,  approval-oriented,  and  stereotypic  reason-
ing). The multivariate Fs for sex, F\(>, 25) = 3.16, p < .019, and

for time, F(l,  24) = 7.74, p < .005, were significant. There was
a significant sex difference  for pragmatic reasoning, F\\,  30) =
6.57, p < .016, with boys verbalizing more than girls. The effect
of time was significant  for all categories of reasoning. For hedo-
nistic reasoning, there were linear and  quadratic trends, with
hedonistic reasoning decreasing over the years, but more rapidly
at first, Fs(\,  30) =  133.67 and  17.00, respectively, ps < .001
(see Table  1  for  means). Moreover, for  needs-oriented  reason-
ing, there were linear and quadratic trends, Fs(l,  30) =  53.49
and  27.22, respectively, ps < .001. This type of reasoning in-
creased until age 7-8 and then started to level off.  In addition,
stereotypic, approval-oriented, pragmatic, and direct-reciproc-
ity reasoning increased in a linear fashion with age, Fs( 1, 30) =
12.68, 24.74, 20.86, and 24.22, respectively, ps < .001. Finally,
for direct-reciprocity  reasoning, there were also quadratic and
cubic trends (see Table l),Fs(l,30)=  17.15and4.99,/>s<.001
and .033, respectively, which were weaker than the linear trend.
In summary, hedonistic reasoning decreased during the school
years; needs-oriented  reasoning increased and then leveled  off;
and  stereotypical,  approval-oriented,  pragmatic,  and  direct-
reciprocity reasoning generally increased with age. None of the
age-related changes interacted with sex of the child.

A 2 (sex) X 3 (time) linear trend analysis was computed  for
three higher-level categories of reasoning with a mean of 4.75
or higher for at least one sex at T3, T4, or T5 (role taking, sympa-
thetic,  positive  affect/consequences).  The  multivariate  Fs for
sex, time, and  Sex  X Time were significant,  F\3, 28)  =  3.82,
p<  .031, F(6, 25) = 7.42,/>< .001, and/i(6, 25) = 4.11,p <
.005, respectively. Role-taking reasoning was used more by girls
than boys, F( 1, 30) = 8.20, p < .008. All three types of reasoning
increased in a linear  manner with age, F{\,  30) = 4.35, 9.56,
and  5.90, ps <  .046, .004, and  .021, respectively. The  Sex  x
Time interaction for the linear trend was significant for sympa-
thetic and role-taking reasoning, Fs(l, 30) = 4.35 and 9.51,ps <
.046 and .004, respectively. According to tests of simple effects,
the linear trend (representing an increase) for sympathy was at
least marginally significant  for girls (but not boys), F\\,  15) =
4.35, p < .054, as was the linear increase in role-taking reason-
ing for girls, F(l,  15) =  10.21, p < .006. Finally, according to a
2 (sex) X  3 (time) linear trend analysis, the prosocial-judgment

F{2, 29)  = 4.99, p  < .04. The linear trend  held for girls, ^ 2,
14) -  12.63, p < .001, but not boys, p < .29. In summary, all
three of the more advanced types of reasoning included in this
analysis as well as general level of reasoning increased with age,
but the increase for role-taking reasoning, sympathetic reason-
ing, and overall level of reasoning was significant only for girls.
Analyses similar to those for Ct  were computed  for C2 (but
for a shorter period of time, because C2 participated in one less
follow-up  and  was younger). According to  2 (sex)  x  4 (time)
ANOVAS (MANOVAS could  not be used because of  insufficient
degrees of freedom  resulting from  the small size of the sample)
conducted for all categories with a mean of 4.75 or higher for
at least one sex at one time period (i.e., hedonistic, pragmatic,
direct-reciprocity,  needs-oriented,  stereotypic,  approval-ori-
ented  reasoning), there  were  no  effects  of sex nor  significant
Sex X Time interactions. However, the linear trends were sig-
nificant for hedonistic, needs-oriented, stereotypic, and appro-
val-oriented reasoning, Fs(l, 11)=  17.53,6.14,12.94, and 5.63,
ps < .002, .031, .004, and .037, respectively. Hedonistic reason-
ing decreased  with age, whereas the  remaining categories  in-
creased over time. For needs-oriented reasoning, there was also
a  quadratic  trend,  F([,  11) =  6.57, p  < .026, because of the
increase in such reasoning from age 4-5 to age 7-8, followed by
a drop at age 9-10. The linear trend for direct reciprocity was
in the same direction as for the larger cohort but was not quite
significant, p <. 11. Thus, the pattern of findings for C, over the
first four  follow-ups  was basically replicated by C2 {see Table
2 for means); hedonistic reasoning decreased with age; needs-
oriented reasoning increased with age and then decreased some-
what;  and  stereotypic  and  approval-oriented  reasoning  in-
creased with age.

Because children in C2 were only 9-10 years old, they verbal-
ized  relatively  little  sympathetic,  role-taking,  and  positive-
affect/consequences  reasoning. Therefore, although role-taking

and  sympathetic  reasoning  increased  somewhat with age (see
Table  1), no MANOVAS were computed.

The age trends in the children's reasoning do not seem to be
the result of repeated testing. If they were, one would not expect
the reasoning for Ci to be similar to that of children of the same
age interviewed for the first time at T4 or T5 (C3 and C4). How-
ever, according to ANOVAS, the reasoning of C| and C3 at T4 did
not differ for any category, whereas the only difference between
Ci and C4 at T5 was for approval-oriented reasoning, /Tf 1,61)  -
8.62, p  < .005 (Ci was higher than  C4, Ms  =  4.88 and 4.23,
respectively).

Relation of Sex to Prosocial Behavior, Empathy, and
Social Desirability

At T4, sex was not significantly related to scores for prosocial
measures or for  the reasoning categories. Girls scored  higher
only on the measure of empathy, f(30) = 2.22, p < .034. Thus, in
correlational analyses, sex was not controlled; Spearman rank-
order correlations (ps) were used  for  variables with a  limited
range, whereas all other correlations were Pearson product-mo-
ment coefficients.  At T5, sex was related to some categories of
reasoning (see previous analyses), as well as to empathy, t(60) =
5.03,  p  <  .001,  and  the  five-item  social-desirability  scale,
r(61) = 2.10, p  <  .04 (girls were higher in both). Thus, partial
rs (controlling for sex) were used for most analyses. Because of
the small number of subjects, separate findings for each sex are
not reported. However, there were no consistent gender  differ-
ences in pattern of findings that occurred in both cohorts of a
given age.

Interrelations of Prosocial Indices

The various  measures of helping at T4 were highly interre-
lated {r$ ranged from  .36 to .73). The measure of donating was
positively related to the paper-clips task, ps(25) = -.48, and .40,
ps <  .006  and  .03, for  latency  and  duration  respectively, but
was unrelated to the other helping task. Because of the strong
association between indices of helping, a composite index com-
bining all indices for both types of helping was computed (after
standardizing all measures). This composite index was used in
all analyses.

At T5, donating was unrelated to either latency to or quantity
of helping.  Long latency  to  helping was negatively  related  to
amount  of helping, partial  r(29)  =  -.58, p  < .001; therefore,
these indices were standardized and combined into a composite
index.

Consistency of Indices Over Time

There was evidence of consistency for some measures over a
period of time for Ct. Donating behavior was positively related
at T3 and T4 (7-8 and 9-10 years of age), r{30) = . 4 l , p <. 019,
and from  T4 to T5 (9-10 to  11-12 years of age), r(30)  -  .31,
p < .088. Empathy was marginally positively related from T4 to
T5,  r(30)  =  .32, p  < .079; however, this effect  was primarily
the result of girls scoring higher at both administrations, partial
r(29) = . 10, ns. (controlling for sex). The composite measure of
helping at T5 was marginally positively related  to that for T4,

r(25)  =  .33, p  < .089; however, the T5 composite was signifi-
cantly related  to the T4 composite for  helping put away toys,
r(25) = A2,p<.029(/  = .19, for picking up paper clips). Social
desirability was assessed for Cj only at T5.

Relation ofProsocial Behavior to MoralJudgment
and Empathy

In the following correlational analyses, only categories of rea-
soning used with some frequency (M = 4.6 or higher) were used.
Thus,  hedonistic,  pragmatic,  needs-oriented,  and  stereotypic
reasoning  were used  for  both  T4 and  T5;  in  addition,  direct-
reciprocity, approval-oriented,  role-taking, and  positive-affect/
consequences reasoning also were used at T5.

Donating was unrelated  to prosocial composite score at T4
or T5. However, consistent with the notion that donating reflects
altruism, donating was negatively related to hedonistic reason-
ing at T4 and T5,  p(30) =  -.38, p  <  .04, and  partial  r(29) =
-.41,  p  < .024, respectively  (partial  r[59]  =  -.26, p  < .043,
for C, and C4 combined at T5). Moreover, at T5, donating was
positively  related  to  needs-oriented  reasoning  for  Q,  partial
r(29) = .36, p < .044 (partial r[59] = .25, p  <  .05, for C, and
C4 combined at T5).

Helping, a low-cost prosocial behavior, was not  significantly
related to the prosocial composite score or any category of rea-
soning at T4 or T5.

In summary, the more costly prosocial behavior  (donating)
tended to be positively related to other-oriented moral reason-
ing and negatively related to hedonistic reasoning. In contrast,
the low-cost  helping behaviors were unrelated  to  moral judg-
ment.

Relations of Empathy to Prosocial Behavior
and Moral Judgment

At T4, empathy (M =  14.96, SD = 3.03) was negatively re-
lated to hedonistic reasoning, p<69) = -.30, p < .01, forC, and
C3 combined (p[30] =  -.46, p < .009, for d  only), and posi-
tively  related  to  children's  prosocial  moral  composite  score,
r(69) -  .28, p < .02 (r[30] = .28, p <  .12, for C, only). At T5,
empathy  was  positively  related  to  needs-oriented  reasoning,
partial  r(59)  =  .23, p  < .07, for C, and C3 combined  (partial
r[30] = .37, p < .04, for C[ only), but not to the moral-reasoning
composite  (the  zero-order  r  was  .38, p  <  .034;  however,  it
dropped considerably when the effects  of age were controlled,
because girls scored higher on both variables). Thus, in general
there appeared to be a positive association between the index of
empathy/sympathy and other-oriented moral judgment.

Empathy was unrelated to donating (the more costly proso-
cial behavior) at T4 (r =  .15), but was positively related at T5,
partial r(60) = .38, p < .003 (partial r[29] = .35, p < .057, for
C, only). Thus, the association of empathy to an index of self-
sacrificing  behavior  increased  somewhat  with  age. The index
of empathy/sympathy  was unrelated to helping behaviors that
entailed little cost.

Relation of Social Desirability to Moral Judgment,
Moral Behavior, and Empathy

At T4 and T5, neither the entire social desirability (SD) score
nor the composite score of the five prosocial items was signifi-

cantly related to the prosocial composite score. However, con-
sistent with the notion that the SD scale measures the need to
gain the approval of others, both measures were positively asso-
ciated  with  approval-oriented  reasoning  at  T4,  ps(35)  =  .42,
p <  .01, whereas  the five-item composite  (but  not  the  entire
scale) was positively related to approval-oriented  reasoning at
T5, partial r(60) = .26, p < .04. Neither the remaining catego-
ries of reasoning nor the prosocial behavior  indices were sig-
nificantly  related  to  SD at  T4 or  T5.  Empathy  was positively
related to the five-item composite at T5, partial r(59) = .28, p <
.03, but not at T4 (p = -.01).

Discussion

Two important findings emerged from the longitudinal analy-
ses of the moral-reasoning data. First, the longitudinal  findings
are, for the most part, consistent with those from cross-sectional
work on prosocial moral reasoning and are reminiscent of  find-
ings in studies of Kohlbergian (1984) moral reasoning. Hedo-
nistic  reasoning  decreased  with  age,  whereas  needs-oriented
reasoning, a relatively simple type of reasoning, peaked in mid-
childhood and then  leveled oif.  This leveling off of needs-ori-
ented reasoning was not evidenced in our previous 3-year fol-
low-up (Eisenberg et al.,  1983). Moreover, the other  more so-
phisticated  modes of reasoning increased  with  age, including
approval-oriented,  stereotypic,  direct-reciprocity,  role-taking,
sympathetic, and positive affect  over consequences reasoning.
Indeed, the last three categories of reasoning were not used with
any real frequency  until at least age 9-10,  so change in these
modes of  reasoning  was not  previously  evident.  This pattern
was, for the most part, replicated in a second, smaller cohort,
at least for those categories of reasoning that were used with any
frequency.  The  increase  in pragmatic  reasoning,  especially at
ages  9-10  and  11-12,  was  somewhat  surprising;  however,  it
seems to  reflect  the  fact  that  older children  were more likely
than younger children to consider a variety of situational factors
when resolving the moral dilemmas. This increase was not evi-
dent in the 3-year follow-up.

The second important finding was the emergence of gender
differences in the use of reasoning related to sympathy and role
taking. These gender differences  were not evident in our prior
assessments. For girls but not boys, these types of reasoning in-
creased in early adolescence. This pattern of findings is consis-
tent  with  Gilligan's  (1977) finding of  a  gender difference  in
other-oriented, care-related reasoning. It is quite likely that this
gender difference  reflects  differences  in the socialization  of an
other-oriented orientation (see Block,  1981; Gilligan, 1982).

Consistent with expectations and prior research (Eisenberg,
Boehnke,  Schuhler,  &  Silbereisen,  1985;  Eisenberg-Berg  &
Hand,  1979), sharing (donating) behavior, which was a costly
behavior, was negatively related to hedonistic reasoning. In con-
trast, the  helping behaviors, which  were not costly and, thus,
were unlikely to induce much moral conflict, were not signifi-
cantly related to reasoning. These findings are consistent with
the conclusion that there is a relation between moral judgment
and prosocial behavior, but only when the decision to behave in
a prosocial manner is likely to involve moral conflict. One fac-
tor likely to  induce conflict  is if a prosocial  action  involves a
cost to the actor. The aforementioned findings are unlikely to be
caused by the difference  between helping and donating because

both high-cost donating and high-cost helping have been related
to younger children's moral judgment, whereas low-cost help-
ing and donating have not (Eisenberg & Shell, 1986).

Both level and  mode of prosocial  moral judgment  were re-
lated  to  children's  empathy.  Specifically,  empathy  was posi-
tively related to general level of reasoning at T4 and to needs-
oriented reasoning at T3 and was negatively associated with he-
donistic  reasoning  at  T4.  These findings are  consistent  with
Hoffman's  (in  press) and  Eisenberg's (1986) suggestions  that
sympathetic responsivity may both enhance the development of
moral reasoning based on prosocial values and facilitate the use
of such reasoning once one is capable of such reasoning. This
former notion in particular is quite different  from that of Kohl-
berg (1984). who has suggested that affect  is channeled by level
of moral judgment.  The fact  that  empathy  at  T4  was signifi-
cantly related to moral reasoning at T5, r(30) -  .55, p <  .001,
and not the reverse, r(30) -  .21, is consistent with the view that
sympathetic responsiveness might enhance the development of
some mature modes of moral judgment.

Empathy was significantly positively related to donating at T5
but  not  T4.  Perhaps the association  between  prosocial action
and empathy/sympathy becomes somewhat stronger with age;
this might be because older children are better able to interpret
and act on their feelings. This finding is consistent  with  Hoff-
man's (1984) suggestion that the link between empathy and al-
truism is strengthened as children become more able to under-
stand another's life circumstances beyond the immediate situa-
tion.  Clearly,  the  stronger  relation  between  empathy  and
prosocial action at an older age was not mediated by the associa-
tion of both constructs to moral judgment because the relation
between  empathy  and  moral judgment  did  not  increase with
age.  Empathy and sympathy probably affect  behavior directly
as well through their indirect effects on moral cognitions.

In summary, there seems to be a relatively consistent pattern
for the development of prosocial moral judgment, one found in
both cross-sectional and longitudinal work, at least for middle-
class American children. Moreover, prosocial  moral judgment,
some types of prosocial behaviors, and empathic responsiveness
tend to be interrelated in theoretically important ways. Whether
these interrelations change with age as moral reasoning develops
is a question for future research.
