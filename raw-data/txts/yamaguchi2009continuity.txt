Abstract

Research examining the development of social cognition has largely been divided into two areas: infant perception of intentional
agents, and preschoolers’ understanding of others’ mental states and beliefs (theory of mind). Many researchers have suggested
that there is continuity in social cognitive development such that the abilities observed in infancy are related to later preschool
ability, yet little empirical evidence exists for this claim. Here, we present preliminary evidence that capacities speciﬁc to the
social domain contribute to performance in social cognition tasks both during infancy and in early childhood. Speciﬁcally, looking
time patterns in an infant social cognition task correlated with preschool theory of mind; however, no such relationship was
found for infants in a nonsocial cognition task.

Introduction

Historically,  the  study  of  the  development  of  the  mind
has focused on domain-general structures and processes
(e.g.  Piagetian  and  information  processing  theories).
However, the last two decades have witnessed a growing
interest  in  domain-speciﬁcity,  in  which  the  mind  is  rep-
resented  as  a  group  of  specialized  systems  that  process
and represent speciﬁc kinds of information (e.g. Caramazza
& Shelton, 1998; Spelke, 1994; Wellman & Gelman, 1998),
and that, in some cases, develop in a continuous fashion
over  infancy  and  childhood  (e.g.  Carruthers,  2002).
Perhaps owing to its ubiquitous importance throughout
the lifespan, the domain of understanding the social world
(i.e.  reasoning  about  animate  agents  and  their  actions,
intentions,  beliefs,  and  desires)  is  often  explored  under
this framework.

One  particularly  prominent  example  is  research
examining how infants and young children reason about
social,  animate  entities,  and  importantly,  how  this  may
differ  from  their  reasoning  about  nonsocial,  inanimate
entities.  For  example,  infants  interpret  the  actions  of  a
human and a machine differently, imitating the underly-
ing  goals  of  the  former  but  not  the  latter  (Meltzoff,
1995). Similarly, they will interpret the action of a hand
in  terms  of  its  goal-directedness,  but  the  analogous
motion of a stick in terms of its spatio-temporal path of
motion  (Woodward,  1998).  Young  infants  even  appear
to  differentially  apply  constraints  of  object  physics  to

animate  and  inanimate  entities;  for  example,  they  more
readily  apply  the  constraint  of  continuity  of  motion  to
objects  than  to  humans  (Kuhlmeier,  Bloom  &  Wynn,
2004).  These  distinctions  suggest  that  social  stimuli  are
interpreted  and  represented  differently  from  nonsocial
stimuli in the infant mind.

Those  studying  slightly  older  children  (e.g.  3-  to  5-
year-olds) similarly conclude that the cognitive processes
underlying  appropriate  reasoning  about  the  social
world may contain elements distinct to this domain. It is
commonly  accepted  that  children,  like  adults,  interpret
behaviour within an intentional and mentalistic construal,
and this ‘Theory of Mind’ (ToM) explains actions in terms
of  wants,  needs,  and  beliefs  (e.g.  Gopnik  &  Wellman,
1994;  Leslie,  1994;  Wellman,  1990).  Arguments  for
domain-speciﬁc elements in ToM come from a variety of
sources, including, but not limited to, studies comparing
performance on false photograph and false belief tasks
(e.g. Sabbagh & Taylor, 2000; Slaughter, 1998) and studies
of individuals with autism in which there is often a marked
deficit in ToM independent of IQ level (e.g. Happe, 1995).
This  leads  to  the  following  question:  are  the  social
cognitive skills seen in infant research related to those seen
later in childhood ToM? Many researchers have suggested
continuity  in  social  cognitive  development,  and  current
theories range from ones positing a hierarchy such that
infant  abilities  subserve  and  form  the  basis  for  later
childhood  abilities  (e.g.  Csibra  &  Gergely,  1998;  Leslie,
1994; Meltzoff & Brooks, 2001; Olineck & Pulin-Dubois,

2005; Povinelli, 2001) to those implying that some infant
abilities are not qualitatively different from those seen in
childhood  (e.g.  Johnson,  2003;  Onishi  &  Baillargeon,
2005).  Although  these  rich  theories  exist,  there  is  little
research that directly examines continuity speciﬁc to the
social domain.

To date, infant-to-child developmental continuity has
been demonstrated through relationships between infant
cognitive  abilities  such  as  visual  recognition  memory,
habituation,  attention,  and  object  permanence,  and
later,  general  childhood  cognition  (e.g.  IQ,  language)
(e.g. Bornstein & Sigman, 1986; Colombo, 1993; McCall
& Carriger, 1993; Rose & Feldman, 1997; Rose, Feldman
&  Jankowski,  2003,  2004).  While  these  previous  exami-
nations factor into our current issue, they do not directly
address domain-speciﬁcity. Instead, one approach to the
current question is to look for a correlation between infant
social task performance and later childhood ToM ability.
For example, Wellman and colleagues (Wellman, Phillips,
Dunphy-Lelii  &  LaLonde,  2004)  took  advantage  of  a
post-hoc opportunity to examine a group of 4-year-olds
who had previously participated in an infant task (at 12
months) examining the ability to discern gaze direction
and desire (Phillips, Wellman & Spelke, 2002). The 4-year-
olds  were  given  a  scaled  battery  of  ToM  tasks,  and  a
signiﬁcant  relationship  was  found  between  infant  look-
ing  time  patterns  and  ToM  performance.  Speciﬁcally,
infants who showed a larger looking time decrement in
habituation trials performed better on the ToM battery.
Importantly,  no  correlation  existed  between  the  infant
looking time patterns and later verbal ability, suggesting
some  speciﬁcity  in  the  relationship  between  infant  and
childhood social cognition. Similar results were found by
Wellman, Lopez-Duran, LaBounty and Hamilton (2008).
The study by Wellman and colleagues (2004) serves as
an  important  ﬁrst  step  in  examining  the  possible  rela-
tionship  between  social  cognition  in  infancy  and  child-
hood. Given the early stage of this research endeavour,
the  present  study  aims  to  build  on  this  ﬁnding  by  pro-
viding  another  demonstration  of  continuity  using  a
different type of infant social task. In the present study,
we examine whether this correlation across development
holds for children who as infants participated in a task
that  examined  their  ability  to  interpret  goal-directed
behaviour based on past actions and underlying disposi-
tional states (Kuhlmeier, Wynn & Bloom, 2003). In addi-
tion,  our  study  provides  another  comparison  necessary
to explore developmental continuity speciﬁc to the social
domain:  the  relationship  between  infant  nonsocial
cognitive ability and later childhood social competence.
Speciﬁcally,  we  examine  the  relationship  between  pre-
schoolers’ ToM performance and infants’ looking patterns
in a nonsocial task examining their ability to discriminate
temporal  durations  of  sounds.  Correlated  performance
on  both  infant  tasks  and  ToM  would  indicate  that  we
are  likely  only  tapping  into  individual  differences  in
domain-general abilities. In contrast, if the social-cognitive
abilities we see in infancy are related to childhood ToM

by  shared  domain-speciﬁc  elements,  only  performance
across the same domain should be related.

Methods

Participants

Participants included 32 healthy 4-year-olds (mean age:
4;9, range: 4;3 to 5;3) who had previously participated in
either the Infant Social or Infant Nonsocial Task. There
was  one  participant  who  had  participated  in  both  the
Infant Social and the Infant Nonsocial Task.

Infant social task

Our  Infant  Social  Task  group  comprised  children  who
had participated in Kuhlmeier, Wynn and Bloom (2003)
as  infants.  In  that  study,  35  12-month-olds  participated
in  a  habituation  procedure  examining  their  ability  to
understand goal-directed actions and to interpret future
actions based on previously observed behaviour. During
habituation  trials,  infants  were  shown  movies  that
depicted a computer-animated circle attempting to climb
a  hill.  The  circle  was  either  helped  up  the  hill  by  one
object (e.g. a triangle) or hindered and pushed down the
hill by another (e.g. a square). After habituation, infants
saw  two  test  movies  that  presented  the  same  three
agents, but in a different context. Infants looked sig-
niﬁcantly  longer  at  test  movies  in  which  the  circle
approached  the  helpful  object  than  those  in  which  it
approached  the  hindering  object,  indicating  that  they
had  distinguished  between  the  helping  and  hindering
agents during habituation and had speciﬁc expectations
as  to  the  subsequent  actions  of  the  circle  in  relation  to
them.  Kuhlmeier 
  (2003)  conducted  two  similar
experiments  in  this  study  (Experiments  1  and  2),  the
second  experiment  serving  to  replicate  the  ﬁrst  under
conditions in which the stimuli positions were reversed.
Because there were no statistical differences between the
two experiments, the participant groups were combined
for subsequent recruiting for the preschool ToM task in
the present study.

discriminate lengths of tones at a ratio of 1:2 was exam-
ined using a habituation paradigm. Two versions of the
experiment (Experiments 1 and 3) were completed, using
tone durations of 2s versus 4s, and .5s versus 1s, respec-
tively. Across both experiments and all conditions, after
habituation to one tone (e.g. 2s), infants looked signi-
ﬁcantly  longer  after  the  novel  duration  (e.g.  4s)  as
compared to the familiar duration (e.g. 2s). Again, there
were no statistical differences between the two experiments,
and  thus,  both  participant  groups  were  combined  for
subsequent  recruiting  for  the  preschool  theory  of  mind
task.

Of the 34 original participants in vanMarle and Wynn
(2006), 15 (7 from Experiment 1 and 8 from Experiment 3)
returned for the ToM battery (mean age: 4;8, range: 4;3
to 5;3). Infants in the original study looked signiﬁcantly
longer  at  the  novel  temporal  duration  by  1.30s,  and  in
the  current  sample,  the  average  was  1.72s.  Again,  the
returning  group  did  not  differ  signiﬁcantly  from  the
original subject population (

(47) = .007,

Procedure

Following  Wellman  and  Liu  (2004),  the  ToM  battery
included ﬁve tasks that ranged in difﬁculty and together
evaluated children’s abilities to understand others’ knowledge
states, desires, and emotions (Appendix 1). The tasks were
administered  in  one  of  three  pseudo-random  orders,
where the easiest task (Diverse Desires) was always the ﬁrst
or second task, and the most difﬁcult task (Real–Apparent
Emotion)  was  always  the  last  or  second  to  last  task.
Each participant completed all ﬁve tasks. On the battery,
a child could score 0 (no tasks correct) to 5 (all tasks correct).

Measures for correlational analyses

Infant test preference

To measure the discrimination between the two types of
test trials within each infant task, two kinds of preference
scores  were  calculated.  The  ‘Simple  Preference  score’
was  the  difference  between  average  looking  time  to  the
overall preferred event (i.e. preferred by the majority of
infants)  and  the  non-preferred  event.  Additionally,  we
included  an  ‘Alternative  Preference  score’  as  suggested

1
 For reasons inherent to the theories underlying the individual infant
studies that were used, the social cognition task was conducted at 12
months and the nonsocial cognition task at 6 months. For the present
study, there may be concern that conceivably there is a higher correla-
tion  between  measures  taken  closer  in  age.  However,  previous  meta-
analyses conclude that there are signiﬁcant correlations between infant
looking time patterns in nonsocial tasks at as young as 2 months and
later general cognitive competence at 6 years and older, and that these
correlations  remain  relatively  stable  throughout  the  intervening  years
(e.g. Bornstein & Sigman, 1986; McCall & Carriger, 1993; Rose, Feldman
& Jankowski, 2004).

ing at the overall preferred event across all test trials: the
preferred test trials divided by the sum of the preferred
and non-preferred trials. The two test preference measures

we  include  both  measures  for  comparison  with  future

appropriate than the Simple Preference for ‘preferential-
looking’  experimental  designs  where  two  events/stimuli
are  presented  simultaneously  and  looking  time  to  an
individual  stimulus  is  considered  in  relation  to  total
looking at all stimuli.

Infant habituation decrement

et  al.

Similar  to  Wellman 
  (2004,  2008)  and  following
Bornstein  and  Sigman  (1986),  a  measure  of  decrement
of  attention  during  habituation  was  generated  by  sub-
tracting the sum of looking time for the last two habitu-
ation  trials  from  the  sum  of  the  ﬁrst  two,  and  dividing
by the sum of the ﬁrst two trials.

Theory of mind performance

Additional analyses

The  Infant  Social  and  Nonsocial  samples  were  thus
found  to  differ  in  terms  of  their  relationships  with
childhood ToM. Two additional analyses were performed
to ensure the validity of this ﬁnding. In order to be sure
that our small samples were not being overly inﬂuenced
by  any  ‘extreme’  members,  we  also  performed  the  cor-
relation  analyses  for  test  preference  and  ToM  without
including  one  participant  from  the  Infant  Social  Task
and one from the Infant Nonsocial Task who were 2.31
(Social Task) and 2.19 (Nonsocial Task) standard devi-
ations  above  the  mean  for  their  group  in  the  Simple
Preference score. Excluding these cases did not affect the
pattern  of  results.  The  correlation  for  the  Infant  Social
Task group remained signiﬁcant, and the Infant Nonsocial
Task group remained nonsigniﬁcant: 
 = .05
for the Infant Social group and 
 = .32 for
the  Infant  Nonsocial  group.  No  such  extreme  scores
existed in the Alternative Preference score.

Additionally, the Infant Nonsocial group did not have
a restriction of range relative to the Infant Social group.
For the Simple Preference score, the Infant Social group

and  the  Infant  Nonsocial  group  had  a  range  of  20.89s
with  an  average  of  1.31s  (6.51

Alternative Preference score, the Infant Social group had
a range of .46 with an average of .55 (.12 
), and the
Infant Nonsocial group had a range of .54 with an aver-
age of .51 (.16 
). Thus, the correlation coefﬁcients for
the  nonsocial  group  were  likely  not  artiﬁcially  reduced
by limited variability in the dataset.

  The  correlation  between  the  Infant  Social  test  preference  and  ToM
was  also  examined  with  habituation  decrement  partialled  out.  Since
habituation decrements tend to be correlated with general intelligence
(e.g.  Bornstein  &  Sigman,  1986),  it  is  possible  that  our  habituation
values  index  domain-general  processing.  Thus,  this  analysis  offers  a
means of examining whether the relationship between test preference
and  ToM  stands  with  a  proxy  for  general  intelligence  controlled.

Given  that  the  Infant  Social  Task  can  be  characterized
as  a  ‘difﬁcult’  task  (Kuhlmeier,  Wynn  &  Bloom,  2006),
and that approximately one-third (35%) of the infants in
the  present  sample  observed  the  maximum  number  of

continuity  within  social  cognition,  and  extends  the
relationship  between  infant  social  cognition  and  later
ToM  to  a  different  type  of  task.  Additionally,  we  have
tentatively  demonstrated  that  this  relationship  may  be
one speciﬁc to 
 cognition. We will ﬁrst address some
of the important aspects of the current study design and
then discuss the implications of the results.

social

et  al.

One difference between the present study and that of
Wellman  and  colleagues  was  the  measures  for  which  a
relationship  was  uncovered.  In  Wellman 
  (2004),
there was a signiﬁcant correlation between infant habitu-
ation decrement and later ToM, but no such relationship
between  test  discrimination  and  ToM.  In  the  present
study, the opposite was true for the Infant Social Task.
It is not surprising that differences would be found, given
other differences in the infant tasks used in the two studies
such as the available cues to agency and the behavioural
traits  emphasized.  Indeed,  the  fact  that  relationships
with  ToM  were  found  with  both  of  these  infant  social
tasks – regardless of the differences in the stimuli used and
precise social ability tapped – suggests that the relation-
ship  with  ToM  may  be  one  that  is  speciﬁc  to  social
tasks, yet perhaps not to one particular social-cognitive
ability.

The current examination of domain-speciﬁc continuity
is not without limitations. Because the study was conducted
post hoc, we were unable to control for various elements
in the two infant tasks such as modality of presentation
(mostly visual vs. mostly auditory) and age of the parti-
cipants (12 months vs. 6 months). In addition, the social
task  used  test  videos  that  diverge  from  a  traditional
habituation  paradigm  in  which  the  ‘familiar’  test  trials
are  exact  replicas  of  the  habituation  trials.  Instead,
infants had to extract information from the habituation
videos and then apply it to the new social scene depicted
in  the  test  trials.  Future  examinations  would  preferably
match  more  equally  the  social  and  nonsocial  tasks  to
more precisely address this question of domain-speciﬁcity.
There  are  of  course  likely  cognitive  processes  that
support domain-speciﬁc abilities (e.g. memory and process-
ing speed; see Rose & Feldman, 1997, for a discussion of
the developmental continuity of these abilities in nonsocial
tasks), and these may or may not cross domain boundaries.
In  addition,  it  remains  unclear  which  factors  of  infant
attention (see Colombo, 2001, 2002) are responsible for
the individual differences that appear in the infant tasks.
Analogously,  there  are  likely  concomitant  inﬂuences  of
domain-general  cognitive  abilities  on  childhood  ToM.
For example, many recent studies have reported a positive
correlation  between  false  belief  task  performance  and
executive  functioning  skills  such  as  response  inhibition
and working memory (e.g. Carlson & Moses, 2001; Perner
&  Lang,  1999;  Sabbagh,  Xu,  Carlson,  Moses  &  Lee,
2005).

While recognizing the limitations of the present com-
parison, two implications are suggested from the current
study.  First,  there  are  meaningful  individual  differences
in  social  cognition  that  appear  early  and  are  develop-

mentally stable, at least for the ﬁrst 4 to 5 years of life.
Second, these may be domain-speciﬁc differences in rea-
soning, in that they may not stem from domain-general
attentional  or  cognitive  capacities  that  would  have  also
affected performance on the Nonsocial infant task.

We will expand on this second point. The 

 process
or processes that lead to success on the infant task used
in Kuhlmeier 
 (2002) need
not serve as 
 for later success on the types of tasks
in the ToM battery. Instead, it is possible that abilities used
in the infant social tasks are part of the same domain of
cognition used in the ToM tasks, and that some individuals
are stronger ‘across the board’ in this domain than others.
How might we characterize the early abilities within this
domain?  Given  the  wealth  of  theoretical  and  empirical
work on infant social cognition, there are many hypothesized
candidate abilities that may bootstrap or develop into the
abilities we see in childhood: detection of animacy cues (e.g.
Baron-Cohen, 1995; Johnson, 2003; Leslie, 1994; Premack,
1990), speciﬁc attention to relevant features of animates
(e.g.  Klin,  Jones,  Shultz  &  Volkmar,  2003),  processes  of
identiﬁcation and imitation (e.g. Meltzoff, 2002), parsing
of  action  into  goal  ‘units’  (e.g.  Baldwin  &  Baird,  2001;
Baldwin,  Baird,  Saylor  &  Clark,  2001),  detection  of  goal-
directedness (e.g. Leslie, 1994; Woodward, 1998), detection
of dispositional states (e.g. Kuhlmeier 
, 2003; Song,
Baillargeon  &  Fisher,  2005),  a  teleological  stance  (e.g.
Csibra  &  Gergely,  1998;  Gergely,  Nàdasdy  &  Csibra,
1995),  and  detection  of  gaze  and  gaze  following  (e.g.
Baron-Cohen,  1995),  among  others.  Broadly,  we  might
speak  of  these  as  an  interest  in  and  attention  to  the
social world that may differ across infants and ultimately
cause some to be more observant and learn more about
the social world than others (Wellman 
, 2004, 2008).
At this point, the existent data demonstrate a possible
relationship  between  infant  social  cognition  and  later
theory  of  mind  skills  that  may  not  hold  for  infant
nonsocial  cognition.  The  precise  abilities  that  underlie
this potential continuity in social development have yet
to be determined. To more fully examine this question,
systematic  longitudinal  studies  would  be  required  in
which  performance  on  multiple  social  and  nonsocial
infant  tasks  is  compared  within  subjects  to  later  ToM
performance, as well as tasks that tap into domain-general
cognitive capacities such as IQ and working memory.

  We  do  not,  however,  recommend  that  any 
  infant  social  task  be
used as a diagnostic tool for predicting later ToM abilities. Infant looking
times can be variable for reasons other than an overall understanding
of the concept tested (e.g. fatigue, etc.). Additionally, as mentioned, the
present infant task examined only some of likely many social cognitive
abilities related to later ToM.
