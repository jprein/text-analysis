Abstract 

Social perspective taking (SPT) is understanding the social situation of another person. SPT 

helps us to communicate effectively and to foster social bonds, both of which are skill sets 

that youths need to succeed at school and in life. SPT has been associated with reading 

experience (RE), but there has been little research on the factors that support SPT at school. 

SPT involves understanding the fictional characters described in a text. Metacognitive 

strategies (MCSs) taught in class help students comprehend a text. Our aims were, therefore, 

to investigate the interrelations between these concepts and to test whether variance in SPT is 

indirectly explained by RE with books via using MCSs during in-class reading activities. In 

the current study, N = 2,105 fifth-grade students’ SPT, RE and MCSs were measured three 

times over one year of school. The sample consisted of students at all schools with a focus on 

social learning and reading from a nationally representative study. The results indicate 

interrelations between these concepts over time and the postulated indirect effect. Variance in 

SPT was partially explained by the MCSs, variance in that was in turn explained by RE 

assessed five months before. This suggests that teaching MCSs provides a way to support 

students’ SPT when reading texts with fictional characters and when students have 

experience in reading.

Social Perspective Taking and Metacognition of Children. 

A Longitudinal View Across the Fifth Grade of School. 

SPT has been described as the cognitive dimension of empathy (Davis, 1980). SPT is 

also conceptualized within the cognitive-developmental framework of theory of mind (ToM; 

e.g., Baron-Cohen, Leslie, & Frith, 1985). Further conceptualizations of SPT include theory 

and simulation (e.g., Epley, Keysar, van Boven, & Gilovich, 2004). Thus, SPT is an attempt 

to consider and understand the behavior and the situation of another person by putting 

oneself in the other person’s place (e.g., Chambers & Davis, 2012; Epley et al., 2004). The 

development of social understanding has been examined within humanistic approaches in 

terms of distinctions among self and non-self, perception, and self-other experiences, largely 

based on the ideas of Merleau-Ponty (e.g., De Jaegher, Di Paulo & Gallagher, 2010; 

Gallagher & Metzloff, 1996). Social understanding has also been related to reflective 

conversation that assists in understanding others’ viewpoints (e.g., Halling, Kunz, & Rowe, 

1994).  

All mental representations of others’ viewpoints are a priori anchored in the self, in 

children, adolescents, and adults (e.g., Epley et al., 2004; Gallagher & Metzloff, 1996). One 

way to distance oneself from this anchor is to flexibly switch between one’s own and 

another’s (or others’) social viewpoints (Fizke, Barthel, Peters, & Rakoczy, 2014). This 

requires coordinating one’s own viewpoint with that of another (Foody, Barnes-Holmes, & 

Barnes-Holmes, 2012; Selman, 1980). Coordination is associated with adequately regulating 

social perspectives by means of theory, simulation (Epley et al., 2004), or monitoring and 

controlling knowledge about another person. Monitoring and controlling knowledge is 

known as metacognition and is framed in models such as theory of mind (e.g., Schneider, 

2015). Thus, SPT can be understood as person-related metacognition, and metacognition is 

linked to reading and language (e.g., Schneider, 2015). For example, SPT is applied when 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

5 

one tries to understand a historical or fictional character’s perspective as described in a text, 

and MCSs are applied in coordinating perspectives as in arbitrary text. The more children 

coordinate different perspectives in arbitrary text before, while or after reading the text, the 

more reading experience they gain with different types of texts.  

RE is defined as the context in which a reader has a representation of meaning while 

reading (Britt, Goldman, & Rouet, 2012; Mullis, Martin, & Sainsbury, 2015). This 

representation is connected to an existing network of vocabulary, related knowledge, 

strategies, and skills (e.g., Baker & Beall, 2009; Cunningham & Stanovich, 1997; Schneider, 

2015). This definition of RE coheres with the phenomenal tradition of human experiences 

understood in a self-constructed world as direct experience, in writing, or in reading (e.g., 

Heidegger, 1962, Merleau-Ponty, 1962, Miller, Nash & Fetty, 2014). Thus, RE is a 

phenomenon with multiple definitions in diverse traditions (e.g., Habermas, 1984; Heidegger, 

1962, Merleau-Ponty, 1962). For example, Heidegger (1962) said that we look to the future to 

see the past coming at us again. This has intuitive appeal when we consider how reading can 

inspire the reader to think about the future. The existential-phenomenological angle 

perspective permits a view on the overlaps and disjoins among theories of human action (e.g., 

Habermas, 1984; Park, 2010) and/or development (e.g., Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Gallagher 

& Metzloff, 1996) theories.  

Crossley (2000) discussed Ricoeur’s work on human action in terms of the 

construction of meaning within text material and imagining the social world around us.  This 

formed part of the “meaning-making model” proposed by Park (2010, p. 258), although the 

focus here was on critical life event adjustment. Nonetheless, the concept of “appraised event 

meaning” within Park’s model (2010, p. 258) appears relevant to the construction of meaning 

during reading.  

Constructed meaning serves as a foundation for a child’s subsequent appraisals of text 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

6 

material. The more positive these appraisals are, the higher the frequency with which the 

child will read similar texts when given the opportunity. Thus, RE is a growing network of 

knowledge constructed in tandem with reading habits, such as frequency of reading different 

types of text material, such as books (see Cunningham & Stanovich 1997, for a brief 

overview). Taken together, SPT, metacognition, and RE each have strong ties to humanistic 

psychology.  

A relevant question is whether SPT, using MCSs during in-class activities, and 

reading experience with books, are interrelated. Specifically, SPT and reading might be 

indirectly associated via in-class use of MCSs. If SPT is associated with teaching MCSs and 

in turn with reading texts containing different social perspectives, this would suggest one 

avenue for improving students’ communication and fostering the social bonds necessary for 

an active and engaged life.  

Social Perspectives While Reading 

Contact with different social perspectives during reading assumes a relational 

network that excludes non-relational possibilities (e.g., Heidegger, 1962). The relating of 

oneself to the world and thus the development of relational networks are fundamentally 

human capabilities. According to Stern (1985), development in the first years of life involves 

the abstraction of a verbal self from the child’s direct observations. As such, the development 

of the self-concept is a necessary anchor for exploring the verbal world. These views are also 

in line with Vygotsky’s (2004) emphasis on developmental context and DeRobertis’ (2006) 

integration of the core ideas of Rogers and Horney into a humanistic theory of healthy child 

development. It is interesting, however, that neither SPT or metacognition are mentioned as 

key developmental phenomena in this account.  

Direct links among SPT, language, and reading have been described and investigated 

in research over the past decade (e.g., Hayes et al., 2001; Hooper, Erdogan, Keen, Lawton, & 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

7 

McHugh, 2015; McHugh, Y. Barnes-Holmes, & D. Barnes-Holmes, 2004). Much of this 

evidence has emerged from a behavioral and functional-analytic conceptualization of 

perspective taking (e.g., Foody et al., 2012) that fits under the rubric of relational frame 

theory, a behavioral account of human language and cognition. According to relational frame 

theory (RFT), arbitrarily applicable relational responding, as the ability to relate stimuli in 

arbitrary ways, begins with the simple coordination between words and the objects to which 

they refer. This skill becomes increasingly complex over the course of childhood and 

facilitates the emergence of relational networks which form the basis of verbal skills and 

complex behavioral experience.  

For RFT, SPT involves perspective-taking relations (also called deictic relations) that 

anchor a person’s perspective here and now (i.e., I is coordinated with here and now), and 

conversely, anchor the perspectives of others there and then (e.g., you is coordinated, from 

my perspective, there and then). In the various relational networks involving these relations, 

there are a myriad of possible relationships among I and you/others, including: coordination 

relations (e.g., you and I are similar in that we both like apples); distinction relations (e.g., I 

am different from you because I am female and you are male); opposition relations (e.g., I am 

extroverted but you are introverted); and hierarchical relations (e.g., I am the parent of my 

children). According to RFT, children develop increasingly complex relational networks that 

support all emergent and directly trained language, within which the relationships among I 

and you/others are central.  

Numerous RFT studies have reported developmental age-based and cognitive ability-

based differences across samples of children, and have involved comparisons between 

typically-developing children and those with developmental disabilities (e.g., Gore, Barnes-

Holmes, & Murphy, 2010). Some of these studies have shown that perspective taking 

relations can be targeted directly for educational remediation (Hooper et al., 2015; McHugh 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

8 

et al., 2004). Therefore, we use this broad framework of RFT and its conceptualization of 

language as relating (Hayes et al., 2001). We assumed that understanding fictional characters 

requires both comprehension of text material and experience in reading, through which key 

relational frames, including perspective taking relations, emerge.   

Cognitive Factors, Gender, and Reading Experience  

Interestingly, Schonert-Reichl et al. (2015) used Davis’ measure (1980) and reported 

higher SPT levels relative to controls in fourth and fifth graders after mindfulness training. 

Using Davis’ SPT scale (1980), Van der Graaff et al. (2014) found that gender correlated 

with SPT in both children and adolescents, and that boys’ SPT levels were significantly lower 

than girls’ at various measurement times.  

However, there have been some mixed findings in terms of correlations with 

cognitive abilities. On the weak side, the correlation was only r = .07 between adults’ SPT 

and passive knowledge of vocabulary on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Davis, 

1983). On balance, RFT’s measure of perspective taking correlated (r = .45) with the verbal 

cognitive performance of adults as assessed by the 34-item Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of 

Intelligence (Gore et al., 2010). The results from several experimental studies have also 

shown interpersonal SPT differences based on first- or third-person RE (Brunyé, Ditman, 

Mahoney, Augustyn, & Taylor, 2009; Sato & Bergen, 2013), which Mason and Macrae 

(2008) attribute to cognitive abilities. Specifically, sequencing a text requires higher order 

skills such as MCSs (Schneider, 2015) that help the reader retain some distance from the 

content of the text and to remain objective whilst adopting the various social perspectives 

suggested by the text.  

Following Schneider’s “taxonomy of metacognition components” (2015, p. 261), 

MCSs may be seen as ways to control knowledge about the mental world or as strategies for 

dealing with knowledge about memory (e.g., understanding of mental verbs, mental states, 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

9 

desires, or emotions), persons, or tasks (Schneider, 2015). Thus, MCSs may be helpful in 

dealing with knowledge about tasks within or beyond social situations. When teachers teach 

MCSs, they monitor students’ handling of text information in terms of their understanding of, 

and learning about, what they read (e.g., organizing text information via sub-headings, 

thinking about text content or discussing text information). Students can recall MCSs (i.e., 

which information they prioritized when sequencing a text) and can reflect upon and organize 

information to understand reading content (Bråten et al., 2014; Mason & Macrae, 2008; 

Schneider, 2015). Students recognize that such strategies aid their reading comprehension and 

their understanding of text-based social situations. When this is the case, they are likely to use 

these strategies recurrently and apply metacognitive knowledge (e.g., Flavell, 1979; 

Schneider, 2015). Indeed, when children remember which strategies they have used 

previously to understand textual characters, they are recalling MCSs. Thus, students’ SPT 

might be associated with MCSs that help in appreciating the various perspectives in an 

arbitrary text, and in turn, using MCSs during in-class activities might be associated with RE 

(e.g., with books).  

Aims and Hypotheses 

Previous results indicated that variance in perspective taking tasks can be explained 

by language in general (see the meta-analysis by Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007). In the 

current study, we speculated that SPT would be supported by recalled use of MCSs during 

in-class reading activities, and in turn, that these MCSs would be supported by RE with 

books. We tested a mediation hypothesis via two predictions: (1) Interrelations exist among 

students’ SPT, recalled use of MCSs during in-class activities, and RE with books. 

Specifically, variance in students’ SPT is explained by MCSs during in-class activities up to 

six months previous. In turn, variance in these MCSs is explained by RE with books at the 

beginning of fifth grade (see Figure 1). Conversely, variance in MCSs during in-class 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

10 

activities at the end of the fifth grade is explained by SPT in the previous six months. In turn, 

variance in this SPT is explained by MCSs during in-class activities at the beginning of fifth 

grade. (2) Variance in students’ SPT at the end of fifth grade is indirectly explained by RE 

with books at the beginning of the fifth grade when the students recall using MCSs during in-

class reading activities. We expected students’ SPT to be associated with RE with books 

when the students recall using MCSs during in-class activities.  

Data Source and Procedure 

Method 

Our sample consisted of N = 2,105 fifth-grade students (n = 973 female) from k = 127 

classes at 66 schools. The sample consisted of students at all schools with a focus on social 

learning and reading from a nationally representative large-scale study. The main idea of the 

nationally representative study was to examine effects of organizational changes from half-day 

schools to all-day schools with extended education by a multi-perspective longitudinal design 

(i.e.,  linking  teaching  contents  with  extracurricular  activities;  for  full  data  description,  see 

Fischer & Klieme 2013; Study on the Development of All-Day Schools – StEG, 2013). The 

schools of the current sample provided extracurricular activities that aimed to support social 

learning (e.g., by role-playing or communication training) and reading (e.g., providing reading 

time  and  books  which  students  desired  or  reading  together  aloud).  The  study  received 

institutional research ethics committee approval. In this sample (Study on the Development of 

All-Day  Schools – StEG,  2013),  n = 637  students  attended  a  Gymnasium  (the  most 

academically-oriented  type  of  secondary  school  in  Germany),  while  the  other  n  =  1,468 

students attended a secondary school with a more vocational curriculum. In general, the type 

of  secondary  school  students  attend  is  determined  predominantly  by  their  performance  in 

elementary  school.  All  students  (with  a  mean  of  10  years  of  age)  were  assessed  at  three 

measurement points: at the beginning (Time 1),  middle (Time 2), and  end (Time 3) of fifth 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

11 

grade during the school year 2013/2014. The summer break began after Time 3. 

Measures 

Social Perspective Taking  

Davis (1980) has developed measures to assess the cognitive and affective dimensions 

of empathy, and the independent and interactive contributions of each within self-reports. 

Four items on the SPT scale used in this study stemmed from a subscale of this empathy 

questionnaire (Davis, 1980; for psychometric properties in other studies see Davis, 1983; 

Schonert-Reichl et al., 2015; Study on the Development of All-day Schools – StEG, 2013; 

van der Graaff et al., 2014). Students responded to each of the five items using the same 

scenario “Imagine yourself in your school” to encourage them to think about how they 

usually act in social situations at school. Students’ SPT was assessed by their responses to the 

question and various response options:  

What do you do? a) I sometimes try to understand my friends better by imagining 

how things look from their perspective; b) I believe that there are two sides to every 

question and try to look at them both; c) Before criticizing somebody, I try to 

imagine how I would feel if I were in their place; d) I try to look at everybody’s side 

of a disagreement before I make a decision; or e) I pay attention to how other 

people feel.  

Students ranked their responses on a 4-point scale (from 1 = not true at all to 4 = absolutely 

true). Thus, high scoring on the cognitive dimension of the SPT measure indicates that the 

person tends to consider the views of others and “to anticipate the behavior and reaction of 

others” (Davis, 1983, p. 115), pointing to understanding of the frames of reference of both 

oneself and others. This SPT measure has been used in several large-scale surveys (Schonert-

Reichl et al., 2015; Study on the Development of All-Day Schools – StEG, 2013; Van der 

Graaff et al., 2014). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha was α = .84 at Time 1, α = .81 at Time 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

12 

2, and α = .86 at Time 3, thus demonstrating satisfactory internal consistency. 

Intercorrelations between the items and the mean of the items ranged from .56 to .62. SPT 

at Time 3 served as the dependent variable for analyzing interrelations and testing the 

mediation hypothesis.  

Metacognitive Strategies 

To measure students’ MCSs, we asked them, “What do you do when you are reading 

a text very thoroughly in class?” The six response choices were as follows: a) I mark 

passages (e.g., with a highlighter); b) I take notes (e.g., at the border of the text or on a 

separate sheet of paper); c) I speak to others about what I've read; d) I take time to think 

about what I've read; e) I divide the text into sections; f) I pay attention to headings.  

Students indicated the frequency of each of these six options on a 4-point scale (from 

1 = never to 4 = almost always). This MCSs measure was previously used in large-scale 

surveys (for psychometric properties see, for example, Mokhtari & Reichard, 2002; Wagner, 

Helmke, & Rösner, 2009). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha was α = .79 at Time 1, α = .73 at 

Time 2, and α = .79 at Time 3, thus demonstrating acceptable internal consistency. 

Intercorrelations between the items and the mean of the items ranged from .55 to .67. The 

intraclass correlation was low, and the low intraclass correlation shows that values for 

students in the same class did not tend to be similar (intraclass correlation ICC = .03). The 

MCSs during in-class activities at Time 3 served as the dependent variable for analyzing 

interrelations with SPT and RE with books. For testing the mediation hypothesis, we used 

MCSs at Time 2 as the mediator variable. 

Reading Experience with Books 

 

RE was conceptualized in previous research (e.g., Britt et al., 2012; Mullis et al., 

2015). To generate the independent variable RE with books, students responded to the 

following question at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3: “How often did you read books the last 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

13 

half year?” Students indicated on a 4-point scale (from 1 = never to 4 = almost always) how 

often they had read books. Students used the full range from never to almost always for 

their responses (see Table 1), with 11% at Time 1 and 21% at Time 3 of the n = 1,132 boys 

indicating they did not read books in the last six months. Reading no books in the last six 

months was indicated by 2% at Time 1 and up to 10% at Time 3 of the n = 973 girls. 

Someone would read almost always, if s/he reads at every opportunity. We measured data 

skewness via adjusted Fisher-Pearson standardized moment coefficients and kurtosis via 

properties of symmetric distributions, and both were within -2 and 2 at Time 1, Time 2, and 

Time 3, thereby supporting the assumption of normally distributed data (Revelle, 2015). 

Despite that, RE with books was considered as a categorical dependent variable at Time 3 

for analyzing interrelations using the weighted least squares mean and variance adjusted 

(WLSMV) estimation based on logistic regression (Rosseel, 2012; 2016). The same estimator 

was applied with RE with books as an independent variable at Time 1 for testing the 

mediation hypothesis.  

[Please insert Table 1 about here] 

 

Missing Values 

Overall, missing values for SPT and MCSs across the three measurement points 

ranged from 0% to 10%. Table 1 shows the number of missing values. Missing values for RE 

were below 6%. Because of the missing values, we entered structural equations such as the 

CFA by the full information maximum likelihood (FIML) procedure provided in the R 

package lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). 

Control Variables  

 

Previous research suggested correlations between SPT and verbal abilities (e.g., Gore 

et al., 2010) as well as general cognitive abilities (e.g., Schonert-Reichl et al., 2015), as 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

14 

mentioned above. Therefore, we considered verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities and 

reading speed as covariates in the current study. Verbal and nonverbal abilities were assessed 

using cognitive performance tasks (Weiß, 2006), which measured comprehension of general 

and advanced German vocabulary, as well as verbal and nonverbal (fluid reasoning by 

matrices) processing capacity. Reading speed was tested with the standardized Salzburger 

Lese-Screening 5–8 (Auer et al., 2011). Students read syntactically and grammatically simple 

sentences as quickly as possible and responded to questions pertaining to the sentences. Table 

2 contains product-moment-correlation coefficients at Time 1, and shows a correlation 

between knowledge of vocabulary and reading speed. 

[Please insert Table 2 about here] 

Statistical Analyses  

A confirmatory two-factor analysis (CFA) using lavaan (Rosseel, 2012) indicated 

that the postulated structure fit the data. Therein, we included the SPT and MCSs items at 

Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3, considering the cluster classes at school; χ2 = 1102.029, df = 

480, fit indices: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .031, C.I. [.029, 

.033], comparative fit index (CFI) = .983, standardized root mean square residual 

(SRMR) = .040. Furthermore, boys and girls comprehended the items adequately over 

time, indicating scalar invariance across sex and over time in multi-group analyses 

specified simultaneously with the CFA, Models 1 to 4: DELTA.CFI .004–.006 by WLSMV 

(Pornprasertmanit, Miller, Schoemann, & Rosseel, 2014).  

Interrelations and indirect relations were specified as follows: First, a latent auto-

regression model with cross-lags was specified with SPT, using MCSs during in-class 

activities and RE with books at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 for boys and girls 

simultaneously. Control variables were included in that model (passive knowledge of 

vocabulary; Weiß, 2006), reading speed (Auer et al., 2011), and fluid reasoning measured by 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

15 

matrices (Weiß). Subsequently, a latent mediation model was specified, again including these 

control variables. Both models are drawn in Figure 1 with control variables, (i.e., the auto-

regression model with cross-lags above and the mediation model below). The models were 

specified with the R package lavaan and WLSMV estimation (Rosseel, 2012; 2016). The 

cluster structure classes at school was considered in these analyses (Rosseel, 2012).

Results 

The Relationship between Social Perspectives and Metacognition over Time 

Results from product-moment correlations are depicted in Table 2. The variables SPT, 

RE with books, and using MCSs during in-class-activities at Time 1 correlated significantly 

with each other (see Table 2). The results from the latent auto-regressive model with cross-

lags indicated a good fit between assumed and real data structure (χ2 = 2,816.810; df = 1,332; 

CFI = .960, RMSEA = .042, C.I. [.039, .043], SRMR = .053). Figure 2 and Table 3 show the 

results of the auto-regressive modeling with cross-lags.  

By the end of fifth grade, SPT at Time 3 was only significantly associated with girls’ 

MCSs during in-class-activities at Time 2, but not by RE with books at Time 2. Neither boys’ 

nor girls’ RE with books was associated with either SPT at Time 2 or MCSs at Time 2. 

However, girls’ MCSs during in-class activities at Time 3 were significantly associated with 

SPT at Time 2 and RE with books at Time 2, but boys’ MCSs were not (see Figure 2 and 

Table 3).  

The interrelations within the fifth grade were as follows: boys’ and girls’ SPT at Time 

2 was significantly associated with RE with books at Time 1 and the MCSs at Time 1. RE 

with books at Time 2 was only significantly associated with boys’ and girls’ MCSs at Time 1, 

not with SPT at Time 1. The MCSs at Time 2 were significantly associated with boys’ and 

girls’ SPT at Time 1 and with RE with books at Time 1 (see Figure 2 and Table 3). This 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

16 

latent auto-regression model with cross-lags explained significantly 35% of variance in boys’ 

SPT and 41% of variance in girls’ SPT.  

[Please insert Table 3 about here] 

We tested the mediation hypothesis with the model including SPT, using MCSs 

during in-class activities, RE with books, and the control variables mentioned above 

simultaneously for boys and girls (see the model below in Figure 1). Fit indices indicated that 

the model structure was acceptable identified in the data (bootstrap, WLSMV-estimator, χ2 = 

655.605, df = 164, CFI = .92, RMSEA = .053, C.I. [.049, .058], SRMR = .046). Results from 

the mediation analysis are depicted in the model in Figure 2 and in Table 4. Boys’ SPT at 

Time 3 was significantly associated with RE with books at Time 1, whereas girls’ SPT at 

Time 3 was not associated with RE at Time 1 (direct path a). However, boys’ and girls’ SPT 

at Time 3 were significantly associated with using MCSs during in-class activities at Time 2 

(path b), and these MCSs at Time 2 were, in turn, significantly associated with RE with books 

at Time 1 (path c). The results indicated indirectly explained variance of boys’ and girls’ SPT 

(indirect effect), path b × path c = .06, p = .001, and a significant total effect, 

(path a + path b) × path c = .15, p = .000).  

[Please insert Figure 2 about here] 

The mediation model explained amounts of the variance in SPT at Time 3 (i.e., 8% in 

boys’ and 14% in girls’ SPT) through RE with books via MCSs over one year of school 

(specified for boys and girls simultaneously). Thus, boys’ and girls’ SPT at Time 3 was 

associated indirectly with RE with books one year prior via the use of MCSs during in-class 

activities within the fifth grade several months previously (see Table 4).

Discussion 

The aim of this study was to investigate whether high levels of SPT are associated 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

17 

with RE with books and by employing MCSs while reading in class. We argued that SPT 

involves the coordination of one’s own and others’ perspectives (e.g., Foody et al., 2012). 

SPT is facilitated when students engage more often in reading, organizing, and reflecting 

upon textual information using metacognition. Davis’ SPT measure (1980) activates internal 

and external frames of reference using different pronouns (e.g., I or their); thus, changes in 

that measure represent SPT levels and the relevant patterns of relational coordination. While 

Davis’ SPT measure (1980) activates internal and external frames of reference mostly with 

regard to other persons, the MCSs measure activates internal frames of reference via the 

most frequently used pronoun I and different mental representations of views on textual 

material.  

Results from previous research (e.g., a meta-analysis by Milligan et al., 2007) 

indicate that students’ understanding of perspective taking tasks is supported by previous 

language use. The positive correlation between SPT and RE with books is consistent with 

results from other studies (Gore et al., 2010; Mori & Cigala, 2015; Sato & Bergen, 2013). If 

students think about the feelings, intentions, and interests of fictional characters in various 

situations, and if they discuss these with others in class, they may be better able to relate to 

real people.  

Coordinating Perspectives on Social and Metacognitive Situations   

We analyzed interrelations among students’ SPT, RE with books, and recalled use of 

MCSs during in-class activities. Furthermore, we tested the mediation hypothesis that SPT is 

associated with RE with books via the MCSs. We specified two statistical models and 

included the available control variables passive knowledge of vocabulary, reading speed, and 

fluid reasoning in both models. Previous research showed differences between boys’ and 

girls’ SPT levels (e.g., Van der Graaff et al., 2014). Considering this previous research, we 

analyzed the data on boys and girls separately and simultaneously using these models.   

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

18 

The new findings are interrelations and an indirect association across a year of school. 

That is, students’ SPT, using MCSs during in-class activities, and RE with books were linked 

to each other over the three measurement times. The SEM moderately supported the idea of 

associations among students’ RE with books, MCSs, and SPT over time. Indeed, the 

autoregressive paths positively affected the amount of explained variance. The results from 

our mediation analysis suggest indirect effects when SPT at Time 3 was regressed on MCSs 

at Time 2 and RE with books at Time 1, while MCSs were regressed on RE with books at 

Time 1. Variance in students’ SPT was explained indirectly by RE with books when the 

students recalled using MCSs during in-class activities. Thus, our results reasonably support 

the assumed model (see Figure 2). That is, the more students reported RE with books, the 

more they agreed with using these MCSs, and in turn, with applying SPT.  

SPT is a skill essential for effective communication and fostering social bonds (Mori 

& Cigala, 2015; Selman, 1980). We conclude from the results that students’ understanding of 

diverse points of view and coordination of perspectives on text material can be supported 

through the use of MCSs taught in class when students have reading experience with books. 

The new-found interrelations and the indirect effect among SPT, MCSs, and RE with books 

support even more than our hypotheses the humanistic psychological approaches (e.g., 

DeRobertis, 2006; Miller et al., 2014; Stern, 1985), and diverse further directions (e.g., Mullis 

et al., 2015; Park, 2010) mentioned in the first sections above.   

Limitations of the Study and Implications for Future Research 

Our  statistical  analyses  were  based  on  data  from  a  longitudinal  study  in  which 

children’s self-reports were used. Self-reported information provided by students on their SPT 

and RE might differ from that observed by other researchers. A confounding variable is social 

desirability, the tendency of students to answer in a manner that is viewed favorably by their 

teachers. Social desirability was relevant for the self-report measures used in this paper (SPT, 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

19 

MCSs,  RE  with  books).  Self-reports  were  controlled  by  assessing  reading  and  cognitive 

abilities.  

Additional items could be included for assessing MCSs that might impact subjective 

and objective SPT measures (e.g., reading the first and last three sentences before the body of 

the text; thinking aloud about a possible continuation of a text in peer learning; or comparing 

the text with a similar text; Bråten et al., 2014). If available in large-scale data, a robust reading 

comprehension  measure  was  a  possible  thread  connecting  social  perspective  taking, 

metacognitive strategy use, and reading experience. 

Boys’  and  girls’  SPT  improves  with  the  application  of  metacognitive  knowledge  in 

classes when they have RE with books. In future research, this might be investigated directly 

using  an  experimental  design  in  which  students  read  texts  and  then  complete  SPT  tasks. 

Randomized independent variables (texts read) and mediation variables (MCSs) also allow for 

the testing of mediation effects, not only indirect effects.  

We propose a broader conceptualization of SPT as perspective coordination, in line 

with existing literature (e.g., Fizke et al., 2014; Selman, 1980) and the current findings. This 

serves to highlight the skill of coordinating different perspectives with different degrees of 

similarity to one’s own, thus reflecting greater flexibility in behavior than the narrower 

concept of taking another’s social perspective. Indeed, no person can fully and only take the 

social perspective of another, because the person remains developmentally anchored to 

his/her own perspective. For example, a person can empathize with another and understand 

what this person is feeling, but all of this is experienced from the person’s own perspective, 

which has not changed (Chambers & Davis, 2012; Davis, 1980).  

Conclusion 

Our main findings suggest interrelations among students’ SPT, recalled use of MCSs 

during in-class activities, and RE with books. Furthermore, SPT was indirectly associated with 

Running head: PERSPECTIVE TAKING AND METACOGNITION 
 

20 

RE with books via the MCSs during in-class activities. Time frames at school are constrained 

and teachers cannot apply role-playing or other direct SPT training with students in class every 

day.  Our  findings  are  easily  applicable  to  daily  classroom  instruction.  For  example,  MCSs 

might be taught by reading texts in which fictional characters are described. This would allow 

students  to  practice  SPT,  which  may  have  social  implications  as  well  as  educational  ones. 

Furthermore,  the  current  research  contributes  to  existing  knowledge  in  the  fields  of  social 

behavior,  metacognition,  and  reading  experience.  Our  empirical  evidence  supports  links 

among these fields.
