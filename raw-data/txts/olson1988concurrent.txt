Nomination and rating scale measures of preschool sociometric status were com- pared with respect to their patterns of concurrent and longitudinal developmental correlates. The study was undertaken to help fill a void in the empirical literature on young children's peer adjustment.Subjectswere 79 4-5 year-old children, currently enrolled in preschool classes.In addition to the sociometric interviews, diverse mea- suresof children's social and cognitive competence were administered concurrently, and longitudinallyone year later. Thesemeasuresincluded teacher ratings of peer acceptance and behavior problems, and performance measuresof social problem- solving ability, impulse control, and vocabulary competence. As expected, the relia- bility of the rating scale technique was superior to that of the nomination measures. Furthermore, all three sociometric measures had modest but meaningful patterns of concurrent and longitudinal correlates. However, the negative nomination measure was distinguished from the others by its consistent association with measures of impulsivity, and its predictive link with aggressive social problem solving. Therefore, negative peer nomination measuressupply unique information about children's so- cial functioning that should be represented in studies of children at risk for social maladjustment.
During the pastdecade,therehavebeennumerousresearchstudieson the mea- surementof social status in school-agechildren. This trend was sparked in part by evidencelinking negativechildhood peer status with later interpersonaldiffi- culties (Cowen, Pederson,Babigian, Izzo, & Trost, 1973). However, relatively little attention has been given to the early detection and prevention of peer-

related social maladjustment(Hymei, 1983; Ladd & Mars, 1986). Although severaldifferent approachesto the measurementof social statusin preschool childrenhavebeendeveloped,empiricalcomparisonsof thesemeasureshave beeninfrequent.Furthermore,little isknownaboutthelongitudinalcorrelatesof preschool-agepeer sociometric measures.Clearly, there is a need for further r e s e a r c h o n t h e m e a s u r e m e n ot f p e e r s t a t u s i n e a r l y c h i l d h o o d .
Two different sociometricmeasureshavebeenmost frequentlyusedto assess social statusin preschoolchildren: nominationsof liked and disliked classmates (McCandless& Marshall, 1957), and ratings of likeability assessedfor all chil- dren in the respondent'ssocial referencegroup (Asher, Singleton, Tinsley, & Hymel, 1979). The nominationmethodsimply requireseachchild to namethree o r m o r e c l a s s m a t e st h a t h e o r s h e l i k e s t o p l a y w i t h a n d t h r e e o r m o r e c l a s s m a t e s that he or shedoesnot like to play with. Typically, "acceptance"and "rejec- tion" scoreshavebeencomputedfor eachchild, basedon relativenumbersof unweightednominationsin eachcategory(e.g. Gottman, 1977). The rating scale measure(Asheretal., 1979)providesanalternativemethodof peersociometric assessmentA. t the preschoollevel, children arerequiredto rateeachclassmate on three-point "scales" by assigninghis or her photo to one of three different boxes.Theboxesarelabelledwith happy,neutral,andsadfaces,respectively, and the child is askedto assignphotosto boxesaccordingto how much he or she likestoplaywith theclassmate.Eachchild'sresultingsocialstatusscoreisthe averagerating receivedfrom all classmatesA. ccording to Asher et al., the rating scalemeasurewasdesignedto improveuponmethodlimitations inherentin the nomination technique. However, both alternative measuresappear to have uniquestrengthsandweaknessesF.ollowingHymel(1983),themeasureswill be briefly comparedaccordingto the following criteria: easeof administration,test- retestreliability, concurrentvalidity, utility in generatingextremegroupsof "at risk" children, and predictive validity. In addition, a somewhatnewer issue concerningethical implications of the measuresis briefly discussed.
The rating scaleand nomination measuresare both relatively easyto admin- ister, requiring only short (10-15 min) interviews with each child. Other so- ciometrictechniqueshavebeendevelopedto assesspreschoolersp' erceptionsof all classmates,such as the paired comparisonmethod (Cohen & Van Tassel, 1978), but require long administrationtimes.
However,the rating scaleandnominationmethodsdo not appearto beequal- ly reliable at the preschoollevel. Studiesof the stability of preschool-agenomi- nationscoreshaveyieldedvariablereliability coefficients,with moderateaver- agetest-retestcorrelations(Hartup,Glazer,& Charlesworth,1967;McCandless & Marshall, 1957; Moore & Updegraff, 1964). Reliability coefficients also a p p e a rt o v a r y a c c o r d i n g t o t h e t y p e o f n o m i n a t i o n s c o r e , w i t h l o w e s t t e s t - r e t e s t correlationsfor negativescores(Hartupet al., 1967). The rating measurediffers from the nomination measuresin that every child in the class is rated by all classmatesP. roponentsof the measurehavearguedthat this changeshouldresult in improved reliability, by increasingthe total number of data points for each

 PRESCHOOL PEERSOCIOMETRICS 411
child (Hymel, 1983),andby reducingthevulnerabilityof thesociometricscores to biasesbasedon friendship (Asher & Hymel, 1981). Indeed, Asher et al. (1979) found that in two different classesof preschoolchildren, the rating score did havehigheraveragetest-retestreliability (.74-.81)overa4-weekinterval than the positive nomination (.38-.56) or negativenomination (.42) scores. Thus, a major advantageof the Asher scale appearsto be superior relative stabilityatthepreschoolevel.However,furthercomparativereserachisneeded beforethis generalizationcanbe fully supported,particularlysincesmall sample sizeswere usedin the Asher study.
How do the different measuresfare with respectto patternsof concurrent validity? Despitetheir often marginal reliability, nomination scoreshave been consistentlycorrelatedwith independenmt easuresof preschoolchildren'ssocial- adaptive functioning, including observational measuresof peer interaction, teacheratingsof socialadjustment,andevenmeasuresof social-cognitivematu- rity (Hymel, 1983). Due to the newnessof the measure,concurrentvalidity studiesof theAsherscalehavebeenlessfrequent.In onereport,Asherscale preschoolsociometricscoresshowedmodestbut predictablepatternsof con- vergencewith teacherratings of maladjustmenton the Behar questionnaire (Rubin & Clark, 1983). However, relatively few investigatorshave compared concurrentvalidity coefficientsbetweenpreschoolrating scaleand nomination sociometrics.Somepreliminaryfindings(summarizedin Hymel, 1983)suggest that rating scalemeasuresare betterpredictorsof social behaviorthan nomina- tion measures,but further investigationis neededbeforefirm conclusionscan be drawn.
A relatedissueconcernstherelativelyutility of thetwo methodsin generating meaningfulclassificationsof "at risk" children. A potentialdisadvantageof the rating scale measureis that it does not permit distinctions betweenrejected (actively disliked) and neglected(ignored) children. Both types of children wouldprobablyreceivelow ratingscores,butcouldbeeasilydifferentiatedby the nominationmeasures.This distinction is an importantone, becauserejected andneglectedchildrenappearto representdifferentdimensionsof socialmalad- justment(Goldman,Corsini, & deUrioste, 1980). For example,peerrejection hasbeenconsistentlyassociatedwith aggressive,impulsive,anddisruptivebe- havioraltendenciesinschool-agechildren(e.g.,Dodge,Coie,& Brakke,1982; Milich & Landau, 1982)but this hasnot generallybeenthecasefor measuresof peerpopularity.
As Hymel (1983)hasnoted,very little informationis availableconcerningthe predictivevalidity of any preschoolsociometricmeasure.This "void" in the researchliteratureis ironic, becausepeersociometricmeasuresareoftenusedto target children at elevated risk for social deviance. In one study (Rubin & Daniels-Bierness,1983)kindergartners'ratingsscoreswerefoundto havemod- estbut interpretablepredictivecorrelationswith measuresof socialcompetence assessedoneyearlater. However,furtherexaminationof this importantissueis clearly needed.

Finally, the use of procedureswhich require children to make negativeso- ciometric choices has been questionedon ethical grounds (Asher, 1983). For example,somehavequestionedwhetherthe processof nominatingdisliked peers mayfurtherimpairthesechildren'sreputations,duetoensuing"gossip" about the interview procedures,or to a crystallizationof negativeattitudesabout the disliked peers on behalf of the respondents.Both sociometric techniquesare vulnerableto theseobjections,sincethey involve the useof negativechoicesin the interview situation.
The purposeof the presentstudy was to comparepreschoolrating scaleand nominationsociometricswith respectto their patternsof concurrentand longitu- dinal correlates.Developmentaldomainscritical to preschoolchildren'ssocial adjustmentwere assessedusing multiple measures,and correlatedwith the dif- ferentindexesof socialstatus.Teacherscontributedratingsof behavioralmalad- justment and peer acceptance.A widely used test of social problem-solving ability wasalsoincluded,becausethis social-cognitiveskill dimensionhasbeen establishedasareliablecorrelateof socialadjustmentin youngchildren(Krasnor and Rubin, 1981). In order to examine individual differences in self-control capabilities,severaldifferentperformancetestsof impulsivitywereadministered to each child. Finally, a measureof vocabularyability was included as well, becausecognitive/linguisticcompetenceis a nonsocialindividual differencedi- mension with important implications for children's social adjustment (Hops, 1983). All measureswere readministeredone year later, so that longitudinal correlatesof different sociometricmeasurescould be examined.
METHOD
Subjects
Subjectswere 79 white 4-5-year-oldchildren (47 boys, 32 girls) currently en- rolled in universityandcommunitypreschools.Their meanchronologicalageat timeofassessmenwtas56months(SD= 10months,range=48-68months), Familial social classrangedfrom lower- to upper-middle.Forty children from predominantlymiddle-incomefamiliesattendedclassesin auniversitypreschool setting, and thirty-nine children from exclusively low-income families attended Head Start classesin the greater Bangor area. Written parental consent and verbalchild assentwereobtainedfor all assessmenptrocedures.
Follow-up assessmentswere conductedone year later on a samp!eof 56 children (34 boys, 22 girls). Most sampleattrition was due to familial reloca- tion.

al. (1979) and nominations of most versus least preferred playmates (Mc- Candless& Marshall, 1957). Each child was interviewed individually by a femalegraduatestudent.First, usingthe techniquedetailedby McCandlessand Marshall, the child was shown a poster board on which photographsof all children in the classwere mounted.Children were askedto identify themselves in the array, and to nameeachclassmate.They were next askedto point to the picturesof three children they most liked to play with, then three children they leastlikedtoplaywith atpreschool.Theratingscaletaskwasexplainednext, using instructionsand training exercisesdescribedin Asher et al. (1979). Chil- drenwerethenaskedto assignpicturesof eachclassmateto oneof threeboxes, which depictedeither a happy face ("children you like to play with alot"), a neutralface("children you 'kinda' like to play with"), or a sadface("children you don't like to play with"). Resulting rating and nomination scores were divided by the numberof ratersin eachclass(to correct for differencesin class sizes)and transformedinto standardscores.The following summaryvariables (Z-scores)wereobtainedfor eachchild: numberof positivenominations,number of negativenominations,and averagerating on the Asher scale.
PerformanceTestsof Self-Control. Threedifferent performancemeasuresof self-controlwereindividuallyadministeredtoeachchild. 1)TheKansasReflec- tion-Impulsivity Scalefor Preschoolers(KRISP; Wright, 1971) is a match-to- sampletest of cognitive impulsivity that yields meanscoresfor numberof errors and for latency to first response.After Salkind and Wright (1977), a total cog- nitive impulsivity scorewas computedby subtractingthe reactiontime from the errorscore.2)Draw-a-Line-Slowly/Walk-a-Line-Slowly(DALS/WALS; Mac- coby, Dowley, Hagen,& Degerman,1965) is a measureof the ability to inhibit fine andgrossmotormovementsin responseto situationaldemands.Thechild is askedto draw and walk straight lines at regular speed(two trials) and then "as slowly as possible" (two trials), yielding inhibition scores(averageslow minus averageregular times) for each child. 3) Finally, a delay of gratification task (Arend, Gove, & Sroufe, 1979) was administered.In this task the examiner
"discovers"asmallwrappedgift andinformsthechild thatheor shemayhave it "later." A 2-mincovertaskand90-seconddelayperiodisthencarriedout, during which E recordsany attemptsto open the gift prematurely.Each child's delay score is the time (in seconds)which elapsesbefore the gift is taken.
SocialProblem-Solving.The PreschoolInterpersonalProblem-SolvingTest (PIPS;Shure& Spivack, 1974) wasadministeredto eachchild. In this test,the child is presentedwith a seriesof hypotheticalsocialproblemsituationsinvolv- ing same-sexagepeers(onechild hasa toy that anotherchild wantsto play with) andmother-childinteraction(achild accidentallydamagesahouseholdobjector maternalpossession),andis askedto nameasmanydifferentproblemsolutions aspossible.Children'sresponseswereassignedto thecategoriesdescribedin the

 414 OLSON AND LIFGREN
PIPS manual. All protocols were independentlyscored by two raters, whose levels of agreementrangedfrom 91-100% for the different categories.When inter-scorerdisagreementsoccurred, final decisions were made by the senior author. The following summary scores were computed for each child: total numberof relevantsolutions,proportionatenumberof irrelevantstorysolutions ("relevanceratio"), andproportionatenumberof forceful-agressivesolutions ("force ratio").
VocabularyTest. The PeabodyPicture Vocabulary Test-l~evised(PPVT-R; Dunn and Dunn, 1981) was administered,in order to obtain an index of each child's level of linguistic maturity.
TeacherRatingsof SocialAdjustment.Teacherscompleteda 42-item pre- school-appropriateadaptationof Quay and Peterson's(1975) Behavior Problem Checklist (O'Donnell & Van Tuinan, 1979). This questionnairehas two broad- factor scale dimensions: Aggression (hostile, destructive, disruptive, un- cooperative,and hyperactivebehavior)and Anxiety (generalfearfulness,social withdrawal, lack of self-confidence).Teachersalsoratedeachchild's level of social competenceusing the Preschool CompetenceQuestionnaire (Olson, 1984). This questionnaireconsistsof 50 4-point scaleson which specificareasof competenceareratedaccordingtothefollowing scaledescriptors:"0" = behav- iorthatneverorrarelyoccurs,"1" = behaviorthatoccursonceinawhile, "2" = behaviorthatoccursmoreoftenthannot,and"3" = behaviorthatoccurs very frequently.The PositivePeerInteractionscalewasextractedfor usein the presentstudy. This scaleconsistsof 7 items which index the relative frequency of active, friendly peer initiations and responsiveness(e.g., initiates play with peers;soughtout by peersfor play; respondspositivelyto friendly peeriniti- ations).
Procedures

Three-weektest-retestreliability trials were conductedusing three preschool classes(n = 34). Reliability coefficientsfor eachsociometricmeasurewere as follows: positive nominations,r = .52 (p < .01); negativenominations,r = .48 (p < .01); and rating scores, r = .81 (p < .001). This pattern of findings is highly consistent with the reliability comparisonsreported by Asher et al. (1979).

DISCUSSION
Empiricalcomparisonsof alternativepreschoolpeersociometricmeasureshave been rare, even though these measuresare widely used in child development research.The idea that peer sociometricmeasuresmay predict children's later social adjustmentunderliessomeof the current interestin thesemeasures.Iron- ically, however,therehasbeenalmostno researchon the longitudinal correlates of preschoolsociometricmeasures.Thus, the goal of the presentstudy was to comparepatternsof concurrentand longitudinal correlatesassociatedwith two popular measuresof sociometric status in preschool children: the traditional nominationtechnique,andthe newerrating scalemeasure.
Consistentwith earlier findings reportedby Asher et al. (1979), the test-retest reliability of the rating scale sociometric measurewas superior to that of the nominationmeasures.Thus, our combinedfindings lend supportto the conclu- sion that the Asher scale has greaterstability than nomination measuresat the preschoollevel. However, it is possiblethat a bias againstthe nomination mea- suremay havebeenintroducedinto the study, by alwayspresentingit beforethe rating task. That is, presentingthe nominationtask first may serveto "prime" the children for the rating task. This hypothesisis worthy of further study, and could be easily examinedby counterbalancingthe order in which the respective tasks are presented.
When global ratings of peer acceptanceand psychopathologywere used as validationalcriteria, all threemeasureshowedsimilar patternsof concurrentand longitudinal correlates.However, when more precisemeasuresof children's developmentalfunctioning were examined, rating scale and nomination mea- suresshoweddifferent patternsof correlates.Although the Asher scalehad no significant concurrentdevelopmentalcorrelatesaside from global rating mea- sures,it did predictchildren'sfine motorinhibition andoverallsocialproblem- solvingability 1yearlater.Thepositivenominationscorewasalsoassociated with children's overall social problem-solvingability, and with measuresof g r o s s m o t o r i n h i b i t i o n a b i l i t y a n d v o c a b u l a r yc o m p e t e n c e .I n c o n t r a s t , t h e n e g a - tive nominationscorewasconsistentlycorrelatedwith measuresof impulsivity, particularly high error scorescombinedwith low reactiontimes on the KRISP test, and inability to wait for a reward. Furthermore,whereasthe other measures of peerstatuswereassociatedwith overall ability to generatesolutionsto hypo- theticalsocialproblemsituations,thenegativenominationscorepredictedlater useof forceful-aggressivesolutions.
In conclusion,all threepeersociometricmeasureshad meaningfulconcurrent and longitudinal correlates. However, consistent with previous research(cf. Coie, Dodge, & Coppotelli, 1982; Goldmanet al., 1980), the patternof these

 PRESCHOOL PEERSOCIOMETRICS 419
correlationsshows that measuresof peer rejection and popularity are tapping differentdimensionsof youngchildren'ssocialfunctioning.Our findingsextend theassociationbetweennegativepeerstatusandlow impulsecontrolto the preschoollevel, and show that negativepeer statusis predictiveof continuing impulsivity. Furthermore,our findings suggestthat negativepeer statusis pre- dictive of a later tendencyto useforceful-aggressivesolutionsin social problem- solving. This is a meaningfulassociation,becauseRichard and Dodge (1981) haveshownthatschool-ageboysidentifiedasaggressiveby theirpeerstendto choosecoercive-aggressivseolutionsto hypotheticalsocialproblem-solvingsit- uations.Thus, importantinformationmay be lost if measuresof negativepeer status are excluded from studies of children at risk for social maladjustment. However,ethical reservationsconcerningthe useof negativesociometricchoices remain an important issue. Although this complex issue is far from settled (especiallywith very young children), it would be helpful to have valid teacher report measuresof children'snegativepeer status, and/or alternativepeer so- ciometricmeasuresof "rejected" statuswhich do not requirechildrento make negativechoices.
