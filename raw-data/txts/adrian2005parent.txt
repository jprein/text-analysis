This study focuses on parent–child book reading and its connection to
the development of a theory of mind. First, parents were asked to report
about frequency of parent–child storybook reading at home. Second,
mothers were asked to read four picture-books to thirty-four children
between 4 ;0 and 5 ;0. Both frequency of parent–child storybook reading
at home, and mother’s use of mental state terms in picture-books reading
tasks were signiﬁcantly associated with success on false belief tasks, after
partialling out a number of potential mediators such as age of children,
verbal IQ, paternal education, and words used by mothers in joint
picture-book reading. Among the diﬀerent mental state references
(cognitive terms, desires, emotions and perceptions), it was found that
the frequency and variety of cognitive terms, but also the frequency of
emotional
terms correlated positively with children’s false belief
performance. Relationships between mental state language and theory
of mind are discussed.

I N T R O D U C T I O N

In recent years, a number of studies that have examined how social
experiences are related to children’s theory of mind development have
included the study of parent–child relations. Since children develop an early
understanding of other people in terms of their internal psychological states
in preschool years, it is not surprising that some features of parent–child
interactions in this period have been linked to children’s advances. These
studies have focused mainly on conversational interactions, with respect to
emotions (Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Tesla & Youngblade, 1991), desires
(Bartsch & Wellman, 1995), internal states (Brown & Dunn, 1991), past
events (Welch-Ross, 1997), mental states or feelings of others when their
children had transgressed against those others (Ruﬀman, Perner & Parkin,
1999) and mothers’ use of appropriate mental state comments referring to
their infants’ minds (Meins, Fernyhough, Wainwright, Das Gupta, Fradley
& Tuckey, 2002). Only a few studies concentrated on parent–child book
reading and its relation to children’s theory of mind development, which will
be the focus of this paper.

Joint book reading sets a particular context for conversational interactions
in which both conversation partners concentrate simultaneously and
in-depth on the same topic. Bruner (1983) argued that it involves a certain
level of inter-subjectivity between the conversation partners, so that objects,
words, actions and behaviour that are included in the narrative can be linked
and shared. Thus, a number of studies investigated book reading to deter-
mine whether adults and children inﬂuence each others’ representational
level, communicative mechanisms, verbalization, procedures, and so on (see
Danis, Bernard & Leproux, 2000, for a review). Moreover, storybooks for
young children frequently centre on the actions and interactions of a child-
protagonist or personiﬁed animals, which may also contribute to children’s
understanding of mind (Dyer, Shatz & Wellman, 2000). Dyer and colleagues
analysed ninety children’s books (forty-ﬁve books were aimed at three- to
four-year-olds and the other forty-ﬁve were for ﬁve- to six-years-olds) with
respect to their references to mental states in three ways : words and
expressions in the text, pictures, and ironic situations. The outcomes showed
that children’s storybooks indeed are an important source of mental state
information, for example through words and irony, even for preschool
children as young as three. The authors suggested that future studies should
examine more closely exactly how storybook narratives aﬀect children’s
theory of mind development.

However, only a few studies so far have examined this issue in the context
of parent–child book reading. Ratner & Olver (1998) explored what role folk
tales – including deception – played in enhancing children’s theory of mind
development. Their results suggested that rereading a folk tale of deception
(‘ The Brave Little Tailor ’) between three- and four-year-olds and their

parents set a framework for social interactions, which supported children’s
understanding of mental representations. Apparently, the fact that the stories
contained deception elicited discussions between the children and their
parents about the protagonists’ thoughts and feelings, and how these could be
related to their intentions and actions. Moreover, these discussions changed
over the course of successive readings as the children showed an increasing
comprehension of the protagonists’ deceptions and decreasingly requested
parental support.

In contrast with text in storybooks, pictures typically fail to represent
mental state concepts explicitly. Nevertheless, Sabbagh & Callanan (1998)
found that parents and their ﬁve-year-olds children who were jointly reading
illustrated wordless picture books, engaged in conversations that contained
more frequent mental state references than comparable parent–child pairs in
their everyday conversations. This also suggests that picture book reading
can improve mental state talk. Ruﬀman, Slade & Crowe (2002) provided
more support for this assumption. They analysed mental state talk during
mother–child picture tasks and related this to children’s theory of mind
understanding. Their ﬁndings showed a positive association between the
frequency of the mothers’ mental state utterances and their child’s per-
formance on theory of mind tasks. Moreover, the frequency of early mother
mental state utterances appeared also to be related to later theory of mind
understanding in their children.

These ﬁndings strongly suggest that joint story book reading provides
useful opportunities for children to have conversations which reﬂect on
mental states, since book characters are regularly presented in terms of their
goals, thoughts, and emotions that shape their actions and experiences (Dyer
et al., 2000). The question is, however, which factors in joint picture book
reading improve children’s theory of mind development. The present
research addresses this issue and focuses on some unexplored aspects within
joint book reading in order to compare the inﬂuence of various factors. First,
there is support for the idea that the frequency of parent–child book reading
at home could enhance children’s theory of mind development (Ratner &
Olver, 1998). Therefore,
the frequency of
parent–child book reading at home would be positively related to children’s
false belief understanding. Second, the frequency of mental state references
during the joint book reading seems to be inﬂuential as well (Ruﬀman et al.,
2002). Therefore, the second hypothesis stated that not only the frequency,
but also the variety of maternal references to mental states during joint
picture book reading would be positively related to children’s performance
on a false belief task.

it was hypothesized that

A controversial issue in the literature is which mental states in parents’
talk are more strongly related to their children’s false belief understanding.
Some authors have argued that belief understanding in children depends

mainly on their parents’ mental state references that are related to beliefs,
such as think and know (Olson, 1988 ; Nelson, 1996), whereas the positive
inﬂuence of other kinds of references, such as desires, emotions and per-
ception is less clear. Support for this view is provided by Ruﬀman et al.’s
study (2002). The authors measured children’s theory of mind under-
standing at three points in time and found that the frequency of mothers’
use of cognitive terms indeed correlated more often with children’s
performance on theory of mind tasks than the frequency of mothers’ references
to desires, whereas a signiﬁcant correlation with the mothers’ use of emotion
terms did not appear. Le Sourn-Bissaoui & Deleau (2001) provided further
evidence for this view in a longitudinal study in which a picture story was
used. It appeared from their study that the frequency of maternal references
to cognition but not emotions was positively related to children’s perfor-
mances on belief attributions when children were 3 ;0 and also six months
later.

On the other hand, Slaughter & Gopnik (1996) have argued that children’s
theory of mind consists of a set of interrelated concepts, whereby the meaning
of the individual concepts is based on those connections. Consequently,
learning about one concept would facilitate children’s understanding of other
concepts in the same domain. Their study showed indeed that training
children – who initially had failed false belief tests – on desires and percep-
tions improved their belief understanding. Training on beliefs with a
diﬀerent group had the same eﬀect, whereas a control group, which was
trained on conservation, did not show a better belief understanding after the
training. In daily life, however, children could be presented with diﬀerent
sources of information about others’ mental states more or less simul-
taneously, but the unique inﬂuence might vary.

In sum, it appears that the inﬂuence of using cognitive terms on children’s
false belief understanding is evident from all studies, but the inﬂuence of
using desire, emotion or perception terms is less clear. Therefore, the third
aim of this study was to look more closely into the contribution of beliefs,
desires, perception, and emotion usage in maternal discourse to the
prediction of children’s belief understanding. Based on previous ﬁndings, the
third hypothesis stated that mothers’ references to cognitive terms during
joint picture book reading would be strongly correlated with children’s false
belief performance, but that the relation with mothers’ references to
perceptions, desires or emotions would be less clear.

Additionally, we controlled for variables that could mediate the relation-
ship between the variables that are the focus of this study (frequency of
picture book reading at home ; the mothers’ frequency of mental states
utterances and children’s false belief understanding), such as children’s age
and verbal IQ, their parents’ educational level and the total number of words
used by mothers during picture book reading.

Participants

Thirty-four mother and child dyads participated in this study. The
children, 19 boys and 15 girls, were between the ages of 4 ;0 and 5 ;11
(M=4 ;10 S.D.=5.83 months). Mothers of
the children responded to
advertisements in schools. All participants came from working- and
middle-class families.

Materials and procedure

Family data questionnaire. The mothers answered this questionnaire at the
beginning of the experimental session. This way, data related to children’s
age and school, paternal education, socio-economic level and parent–child
picture book reading at home were collected.

Verbal IQ. Children’s verbal IQ was measured by the verbal scale of
Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI ; Wechsler,
1990).

False Belief task. The ‘ unexpected transfer task ’ developed by Wimmer &
Perner (1983) was used. Evaluation of the false belief task included the
following steps : (1) Control question : ‘ Did the child who went out see the
other one change the place of the ball ? ’ (2) Prediction question : ‘Where will
the child look for the ball ﬁrst ? ’ (3) Explanation question : ‘Why ? ’ (4)
Ignorance attribution question : ‘ Did the child really know where the ball
was ? ’ Children’s language evaluation and false belief task preceded the book
reading session.

Picture book reading tasks. Mothers were instructed to read four stories to
their children, as they would normally do at home. The ﬁrst story was a
commercial version of ‘ Snow White ’ with the printed text removed. The
other three were stories designed for the research, which had been previously
tested out on a pilot group. They were made up of a maximum of 4–5
drawings with a minimum supporting text : the title and short narrative notes
(e.g. ‘ and then the boy _ ’, ‘ at the end _ ’). The titles were : (1) ‘ The story of
the girl who broke a pencil case and blamed her classmate ’, (2) ‘ The story of
the dangerous bottle left unsupervised in the kitchen ’ and (3), ‘ The boy who
jumped the queue to be the ﬁrst into the cinema ’. All the stories had in
common a presentation of events with obvious mentalist content : false
beliefs, trickery, lies, etc. The CHILDES system (MacWhinney & Snow,
1984) was used for the narrative transcription.

Scoring

Parental education. The educational level of both parents was coded
on a 3-point scale as a measure of socio-economic status. The scoring

was : 1=Certiﬁcate of Primary Education, 2=Certiﬁcate of Secondary
Education, 3=University graduate.

Picture book reading at home. An 8-point scale measure was used according
to the average number of days per week that parents reported that they had
read stories to their children during the last year.

Verbal Mental Age (VMA). In order to compute children’s Verbal Mental

Age (VMA), the scores on the WPPSI were divided by children’s age.

False belief task. Children were asked 4 questions : a control question, a
prediction question, an explanation question, and an ignorance attribution
question. Thus they could receive a maximum score of 3 if they answered all
the questions correctly.

Picture book reading tasks. Mental terms used by mothers during picture-
book reading were coded according to the criteria used by Bretherton &
Beeghly (1982), including cognitive state terms (e.g. think, know, remember),
emotional state terms (e.g. happy, sad, angry), desire state terms (e.g. want,
hope, wish), and perceptual state terms (e.g. see, look, watch). Terms were
counted in two ways, according to Dyer et al.’s (2000) criteria. First, all the
instances of terms within a category were counted as TOKENS of those terms.
Second, diﬀerent terms within a category were coded as TYPES of terms. For
example, the three instances think, know and knew were coded as three tokens
and two types. One coder used the transcriptions and audiotapes to code all
utterances. In order to assess the reliability of the coding, a second person
coded 30 % of the transcripts. Reliability for cognitive state was 89 %, for
emotional state 84 %, for desire states 91 %, and for perceptual states 86 %.

Descriptive statistics

A summary of the descriptive statistics is presented in Table 1. The results
revealed that 29.4 % of the total sample passed all three evaluation questions
(prediction, explanation, and ignorance attribution), 32.4 % passed the
prediction and the explanation questions, 14.7 % passed only the prediction
question, and 23.5 % passed none of the questions. For picture-book reading
at home, 32.4 % of parents reported that they read stories every day to their
children, 20.6 % reported that they did not read stories to their children at all,
and 47 % reported that they read picture books between 1–6 days per week.
Table 2 presents the mean number of tokens and types and the standard
deviations per 100 words used by mothers in picture-books reading tasks.
Results revealed very similar scores for the same categories between Dyer et
al.’s results (2000) from ninety children’s books texts (half for three- to four-
year-olds and half for ﬁve- to six-years-olds) and our data, based on mothers’
spoken language in picture-book reading tasks with a very small amount of
textual information and with four- to ﬁve-year-olds. A correlation matrix was

The data were submitted to a multiple regression analysis to determine

predicted present false belief understanding in children. Results showed that
the frequency of parent–child picture book reading at home contributed to
the prediction of children’s performance on the false belief task (see Table 4),

understanding. Despite the high correlations between tokens and types,
separate analyses were conducted in order to examine possible diﬀerences.
Results showed that both discourse measures were indeed predictors of false
belief understanding, after controlling for children’s VMA, maternal
education, number of words used by mothers in joint picture book reading,
and frequency of picture-book reading at home (see Table 5). Both models
showed signiﬁcance : Model 1 (tokens) : F (5,28)=3.26, r=0.60, p=0.01, and
Model 2 (types) : F(5,28)=3.33, r=0.61, p=0.01.

Hypothesis 3

The data were submitted to a partial correlation analysis to examine
relationships between diﬀerent mother’s mental state terms (tokens and
types) with children’s false belief performance. For this purpose, children’s
VMA, maternal education, number of words used by mothers in joint picture
book reading, and frequency of picture-book reading at home were partialled
out. Results showed that the frequency and variety of cognitive terms (tokens
and types) and the frequency, but not the variety of emotional terms used by
mothers (only tokens) correlated signiﬁcantly with children’s false belief
performance, whereas tokens and types of desire references or perception
terms were not signiﬁcant (see Table 6).

children’s false belief understanding. First and as predicted, children who
took part in parent–child picture book reading at home more often, scored
higher on a false belief task after controlling for children’s verbal mental age
(VMA), and their parents’ educational level. This is consistent with general
assertions about the role of narratives in children’s growing understanding of
the mind (e.g. Bruner, 1990 ; Carrithers, 1991 ; Feldman, 1992), and with
previous ﬁndings on how parent–child interactions may relate to children’s
theory of mind abilities (Brown & Dunn, 1991 ; Dunn et al., 1991 ; Bartsch &
Wellman, 1995 ; Welch-Ross, 1997 ; Ruﬀman et al., 1999 ; Meins et al., 2002).
Moreover, these outcomes extend other ﬁndings about the beneﬁts of
interactive book reading on children’s cognitive and linguistic development
(e.g. Bus & IJzendoorn, 1988 ; Deleau, Gandon & Taburet, 1993 ; Sigel,
1993).

Besides the frequency of picture book reading, the mothers’ use of mental
state terms also appeared to be related to the development of children’s
theory of mind. Our ﬁndings showed that the frequency and variety of mental
states used by mothers were positively related to children’s false belief
performance, after controlling for children’s verbal mental age, maternal
education, the number of words used by mothers in joint picture book
reading, and the frequency of picture-book reading at home. These results
conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that the frequency of mothers’ mental state
utterances (related to the additional input that children receive) is correlated
with their children’s theory of mind abilities (Ruﬀman et al., 2002), but also
indicate that the variety of mental state terms used by mothers (related to the
degree of complexity of the input that children receive) is important in the
process of expanding an understanding of mental processes.

Previous studies (Le Sourn-Bissaoui & Deleau, 2001 ; Ruﬀman et al.,
2002) suggested that mothers’ use of cognitive terms in similar tasks was
related more strongly to children’s theory of mind performances than the
mothers’ references to other mental states, such as desires or emotions. We
tested this by examining partial correlations between each mental state term
(tokens and types) and children’s false belief performance and found a
signiﬁcant relation not only in both tokens and types of mother’s cognitive
references, but also in tokens of emotional terms. In line with other studies on
joint picture book reading, cognitive terms indeed showed the strongest
relation with children’s false belief performances, but this relation was not
exclusive. The fact that this study – unlike previous studies in this area –
revealed a relationship between the frequency of mothers’ emotion terms
might be due to the diﬀerent language, Spanish, that was used in this study,
whereas all discussed previous studies were carried out in English. Some
English emotion words also imply belief understanding. For example,
surprised or afraid that are emotionally laden, but also refer to expectations,
which are mental states. Possibly, the Spanish language contains even more
of these kinds of emotion references ; future studies should look closer into
this issue. Nevertheless, this ﬁnding suggests that it might be important in
future studies to consider the kind of emotion words that are used by the
mothers.

Nevertheless,

the strongest relationship appeared between mothers’
cognitive references and children’s false belief performances. The link
between cognitive states and understanding that other people’s behaviour is
governed by their beliefs, as is the case in false belief tasks, is of course more
obvious than the link between desires, perceptions and emotions with
children’s false belief understanding. The fact that diﬀerent people can have
diﬀerent desires and subsequent emotions is understood quite early in life
(Wellman, 1990). However, many desires do not conﬂict with an observable
reality, as do false beliefs. In order to perform well on a false belief task,
children need to overcome the saliency of reality as they know it, and under-
stand that people’s reﬂection on reality guides their behaviour, not reality
itself. Both semantic and syntactic properties of cognitive verbs would be
closely related to such insight, just as several studies claim that are focused on
relationships between syntax of complementation and false belief under-
standing (de Villiers, 1995 ; Tager-Flusberg, 1995 ; de Villiers & de Villiers,
2000 ; de Villiers & Pyers, 2002). Complementary, opportunities to engage in
richer discourse interactions involving cognitive verbs and people’s diﬀerent
perspectives may enhance a better child understanding of false beliefs
(Harris, 1996, 1999 ; Tomasello, 1999). Studies among clinical populations,
for example deaf children with hearing parents, show that the absence of
this kind of conversation causes serious delay in children’s theory of mind
development (Peterson & Siegal, 2000 ; Meerum Terwogt & Rieﬀe, 2004).

Moreover, from our data it appears that mothers’ references to cognitive
states were more frequent than their references to emotions and desires
during picture book reading (see also Le Sourn-Bissaoui & Deleau, 2001 ;
Ruﬀman et al., 2002). Dyer et al. (2000) also noticed that the books for
younger children refer to cognitive states more often than to desires. Yet,
these data contrast with results from children’s natural conversations, in
which the references to desires and emotions are more frequent than to
beliefs or cognition (Bartsch & Wellman, 1995). This further emphasizes the
idea that, at least in the story-book’ context, adults’ discourse focuses
especially on what children have not yet mastered, thus providing valuable
information to increase understanding the subjective character of cognitive
states.

However, we need to consider the fact that the correlational nature of our
data does not allow us to establish the causal direction of such a relation. In
other words, does the mother adapt her speech to her child’s theory of mind
ability, does her talk facilitate the development of such ability, or can we
consider both relations ? Although other studies (Le Sourn-Bissaoui &
Deleau, 2001 ; Ruﬀman et al., 2002 ; Lohman & Tomasello, 2003) as well as
the ﬁndings of this study favour of the inﬂuence of language input in theory
of mind, our data precludes strong assertions in this direction. In conclusion,
parent–child picture-book reading seems to involve several features and
processes closely related with children’s theory of mind understanding. Book
characters are presented frequently in terms of their goals, thoughts, and
emotions that guide their actions, and thus, encourage readers to talk and
think about them (Dyer et al., 2000). Especially when children are too young
to read or interpret picture-based stories themselves, the role of a more
expert reader appears important to convey mental state information to
children.
