 Social Cognition, Prosocial Behavior, and
 Emotion in Preschoolers: Contextual Validation

 University of Maryland Baltimore County

 DENHAM, SUSANNE A. Social Cognition, Prosocial Behavior, and Emotion in Preschoolers: Contex-
 tual Validation. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1986, 57, 194-201. Relations among young preschoolers'
 social cognitive abilities, expression of emotions, and prosocial responses to others' emotions were
 investigated. 3 types of measures were employed with 27 2- and 3-year-olds: structured social
 cognitive, structured assessment of response to emotion, and observational coding of response to
 emotion displays. Results suggested that subjects' social cognitive acuity and differential responding
 to emotion have heretofore been underrated. Moreover, affective knowledge was significantly re-
 lated to prosocial behavior in semistructured situations. Prevalent affect was related to expression of
 prosocial behavior (e.g., frequent expressions of anger were associated with low levels of affective
 knowledge and prosocial behavior). Thus this investigation benefited from broader conceptual
 definitions and contextualized measures.

 The purpose of this investigation was
 twofold: (a) to describe the affective perspec-
 tive-taking abilities of young preschoolers,
 their prosocial behaviors in response to peer
 emotions, and the interrelation of these two
 domains; and (b) to examine the relations be-
 tween these variables and the children's own
 emotions. Thus it was necessary to create con-
 textually valid means of measuring prosocial
 behavior and social cognition for use in a mul-
 timethod, multivariate framework.

 Though viable theories of prosocial abili-
 ties and social cognition in young children
 have been postulated (see Radke-Yarrow,
 Zahn-Waxler, & Chapman, 1983; Shantz,
 1975), measurement in these domains has
 been weak. There have been three major
 measurement problems: (1) overly restrictive
 operational definitions, particularly for proso-
 cial behavior; (2) cognitively complex, devel-
 opmentally inappropriate measures, which
 require responses (especially verbal ones)
 that very young children cannot provide and
 in which affective cues are absent; and (3)
 inattention to the twin needs of capturing
 young children's attention and of embedding
 tasks within an ongoing social context.

 Measurement of affective knowledge and
 prosocial behavior in current systems thus
 overlooks the abilities and needs of young

 preschoolers; it is not contextually valid.
 Given the use of such measurement systems,
 it is not surprising that the sophistication of
 young preschoolers' prosocial behavior and
 social cognition has often been underes-
 timated, and that the evidence of the link be-
 tween their affective perspective-taking and
 prosocial behavior is sparse and contradictory
 (see Underwood & Moore, 1982).

 Despite these problems, the proposition
 that affective perspective-taking ability
 should be related to prosocial behavior re-
 mains intuitively appealing. A number of the-
 ories (Feshbach, 1979; Hoffman, 1975;
 Shantz, 1975) predict such a relation. Devel-
 opmentally appropriate definitions of proso-
 cial behavior and better measurement tech-
 niques in both domains could help
 demonstrate the theories' validity.

 Operational definitions in these domains

 could also be more contextually valid (i.e., re-
 lated to the social context and abilities of
 young children); prosocial behaviors at this
 age may not only benefit another at a cost to
 self but may also reciprocally benefit the
 child emitting the behavior (e.g., you smile, I
 smile back, we both feel good). Such reciproc-
 ity of prosocial behaviors does occur, facilitat-
 ing preschoolers' social life (Eisenberg, Cam-
 eron, Tryon, & Dodez, 1981; Strayer, 1980).

 The basis of this reciprocity in very early

 other's point of view, in a limited way, when
 such measures are used.

 childhood may be positive affective inter-
 change. Positive emotion display is in fact
 empirically related to prosocial behavior
 (Marcus, 1984; Strayer, 1980). Happy emo-
 tion displays are the earliest and best-
 comprehended emotions and are often
 matched by young preschoolers (Borke, 1971,
 1973; Marcus & Roke, 1980; Strayer, 1980).
 This matching of positive emotion is distinct
 from affect-matching responses to negative
 emotions, both developmentally and in rela-
 tion to social behavior. Matching happy emo-
 tion displays can be seen as a frequently oc-
 curring, bidirectional prosocial behavior, in
 addition to the more infrequent, unidirec-
 tional altruistic responses to distress (Marcus,
 1984). Assessment of prosocial behavior
 might therefore benefit from less conceptu-
 ally restrictive definitions; such definitions
 would include positive affect sharing and
 other capacities of young children, such as
 showing an object as sharing (Hay, 1979).

 Measurement techniques for assessing
 young children's affective perspective-taking
 are not often as sensitive (see Borke, 1971,
 1973). Strict definitions of affective perspec-
 tive-taking require an inference about the
 other's feelings rather than a response made
 only from typical social scripts or one's own
 feelings (Gove & Keating, 1979; Higgins,
 1981). Noninferential social category knowl-
 edge (e.g., "hitting people makes them sad, or
 angry"), however, may represent an important
 early facet of social understanding that facili-
 tates prosocial behavior. Knowledge tapping
 this type of information, which conforms to
 children's social scripts, should be assessed
 rather than being ignored as somehow primi-
 tive. Such knowledge is in fact an important
 source of emotion information from early
 childhood through adulthood (Gnepp, Klay-
 man, & Trabasso, 1982).

 Young children may also be able to make
 actual affective perspective-taking inferences,
 but extant measurement techniques have not
 satisfactorily tested such abilities at this age
 level. For example, the use of cognitively dis-
 organizing sources of information, which are
 radically dissimilar to young children's event
 scripts (e.g., sad expressions at a birthday
 party; see Iannotti, 1978), may have obscured
 inferential ability. More authentic situations
 that could also realistically elicit more than
 one emotion, thus requiring an inference to
 be made, should be used as one important
 facet of contextualized measurement of social
 cognition in very young children (Feshbach,
 1979).

 Another need in the assessment of the

 linkage between prosocial behavior and so-
 cial cognition is the inclusion of the emotions
 of both the performer and recipient of proso-
 cial behavior. Theory has attended to the
 need for including both affect and cognition
 in predicting prosocial behavior (Feshbach,
 1975; Hoffman, 1975); those few researchers
 who have heeded this aspect of theory have
 found that prediction of social behavior is
 strengthened when emotional variables are
 examined (e.g., Strayer, 1980).

 Aggregation of measures is also needed
 in both social cognitive and prosocial behav-
 ior domains but is not often used (Elder,
 1983; Kurdek, 1978; Rushto , Brainerd, &

 Young children can infer others' emo-
 tions and emotional needs and emit spontane-
 ous, sophisticated prosocial behaviors in re-
 sponse to these needs when these abilities
 are assessed observationally in familiar sur-
 roundings (Iannotti, 1985; Strayer, 1980).
 Even 18-24-months-olds are able to comfort
 distressed friends and family members in a
 variety of ways and to switch strategies when
 their attempts are unsuccessful (Zahn-Waxler
 & Radke-Yarrow, 1982). Other contextualized
 assessments of prosocial behavior, where
 structured prosocial tasks were embedded
 within credible, ongoing social interaction,
 have also shown very young children's sub-
 stantial prosocial responding (Iannotti, 1985;
 Zahn-Waxler, Radke-Yarrow, & Brady-Smith,
 1977).

 These positive reactions to others' needs
 can be seen as perspective-taking-in-action
 (lannotti, 1985), but the abilities that underlie
 such prosocial development are disputed.
 This confusion may stem from the use of so-
 cial cognitive measures laden with cognitive
 processing demands instead of the cues in-
 herent in social interchange (Ford & Tisak,
 1983; Keating, 1978). A number of research-
 ers have, however, been successful in using
 more contextualized perspective-taking mea-
 sures with young children (e.g., Brice & Tor-
 ney-Purta, 1981; Mossler, Marvin, & Green-
 berg, 1976). These measures often use
 puppets or other devices to involve the child
 and minimize verbalization and processing
 demands. Children as young as 2 years old
 can clearly demonstrate understanding of an-

 Pressley, 1983). Using aggreg;-tes instead of
 single measures could bring about a needed
 increase in reliability and construct validity
 (Enright & Lapsley, 1980; Ford, 1979). Simi-

 social and social cognitive domains could
 demonstrate convergent/discriminant validity
 (Campbell & Fiske, 1959).

 and with whom they were comfortable. Sub-
 jects were selected in random order for focal
 child observation, situational assessment, and
 social cognitive testing.

 In summary, affective perspective-taking
 and prosocial responses to emotion in young
 preschoolers were tested through the use of
 contextualized measures, reconceptualization
 of operational definitions, and wider use of
 aggregate measures, as described above. The
 major predictions for this study are: (1) chil-
 dren at this age will evidence ability to iden-
 tify others' feelings at both the social category
 knowledge and inferential levels, and will re-
 spond nonrandomly to peers' emotions; (2) af-
 fective knowledge and prosocial behavior
 will be related in young preschoolers, given
 the use of contextualized measures; (3)
 affective and cognitive perspective-taking
 will be significantly related, but affective-
 perspective-taking will be more strongly re-
 lated to prosocial behavior (Shantz, 1975); (4)
 children who show predominantly happy
 emotions or more emotions overall should
 also emit more prosocial behavior, with the
 opposite effect for children who show pre-
 dominantly angry emotions (Strayer, 1980);
 (5) reciprocity of prosocial behaviors will be
 evidenced.

 Method

 Subjects

 Measures

 Affective labeling.-Children examined
 four faces made of felt on which the expres-
 sions of happy, sad, angry, and afraid were
 drawn. They were then asked to both expres-
 sively and then receptively identify these fa-
 cial expressions. Subjects received 2 points
 for correct expressive, 2 points for correct re-
 ceptive, and 1 point for expressively or recep-
 tively identifying positive/negative (feeling
 good vs. feeling bad) dimensions; Cronbach's
 alpha = .89.

 Affective perspective-taking.-Puppets
 enacted 14 vignettes. The vignette was ac-
 companied by vocal and visual affective cues
 emitted by the puppet/experimenter. In eight
 of these vignettes the puppet felt the way
 most people would feel (e.g., fear during a
 nightmare; see Borke, 1971); in six the puppet
 felt the opposite of what mothers had re-
 ported, in a questionnaire, that their child
 would probably feel. The second portion of
 the task was carefully designed to require in-
 ference but to also be within the realm of the
 children's everyday experience. For example,
 mothers indicated whether their child would
 be happy or sad to come to day care, afraid or
 pleased to see their doctor, angry or happy to
 come in to dinner from play, and which food
 they would be happiest to eat.

 Subjects were 27 2- and 3-year-olds from
 two classrooms of a day-care center in a large
 town in predominantly rural surroundings (11
 girls, mean age 34.6 months, range 24-43
 months, and 16 boys, mean age 42.0 months,
 range 30-48 months). Children, were
 heterogeneous as to SES, judged by income
 and housing. Data for one or more variables
 were incomplete for certain subjects (N = 11)
 due to their relocation, extended absence,
 early pickup by parent each day, or mild hear-
 ing impairment.
 Procedure

 There were three types of measures for
 each subject: (1) observation of emotions and
 responses to emotions in free-play settings;
 (2) semistructured measure of responses to
 the emotions of an adult or child; (3) more
 structured measure of affective labeling, af-
 fective perspective-taking, and cognitive per-
 spective-taking. In addition, a questionnaire
 was administered to mothers to decide on ap-
 propriate content for one component of the
 affective perspective-taking task for each
 child. For the more structured measures, chil-
 dren left class one at a time with the adult
 female experimenter, whom they knew well

 Subjects were asked to affix the proper
 face on the puppet, from the four identified in
 the previous task, after seeing the vignette.
 Faces were affixed in answer to the question,
 "How does the puppet feel?" Scoring pro-
 ceeded as in the affective labeling task; Cron-
 bach's alpha = .93.

 An aggregate of affective labeling and af-
 fective perspective-taking tasks was created,
 hereafter called the affective aggregate (reli-
 ability of aggregate via Cronbach's alpha =
 .95); it was created by summing standard
 scores for each measure.

 Cognitive perspective-taking.--Puppets
 enacted five vignettes in which one puppet,
 who arrived late, lacked privileged informa-
 tion about the actions of another puppet. Af-
 fective cues were not part of the content of
 this task. Subjects were asked to suppress
 their privileged information and show how
 the late-arriving puppet would respond in the
 situation (e.g., to look for the red puppet at the
 red house, rather than at the blue house,

 Purta, 1981). Subjects received 1 point for
 each correct choice; Cronbach's alpha = .61.
 Puppets were used to lessen processing
 demands of more representational media and
 to increase contextual validity (Ridley,
 Vaughn, & Wittman, 1982). Puppets were the
 same gender as the subject or of indetermi-
 nate gender.

 Situational.-To measure prosocial be-

 haviors that children emit in response to emo-
 tion given a one-to-one situation and adult
 guidance, children were individually exposed
 to planned but quite natural emotion displays
 of the adult female experimenter and a 6-year-
 old female child confederate, in separate ses-
 sions. Multiple emotion displays that could
 potentially elicit prosocial behavior as
 defined here were enacted. For example, the
 child confederate evidenced sadness at not
 having two cookies; the adult showed hurt
 when she stuck herself with a pin attaching a
 "good helper" badge on the subject's shirt.
 Transcripts of reactions to these emotion dis-
 plays were globally rated on prosocial behav-
 ior from 0 to 6, where 0 denoted active ignor-
 ing and 6 denoted very active aid, without
 regard to degree of guidance used; ratings
 were made for response to each emotion of
 each interactor (adult or child) and summed
 across emotions and interactors. Percentage
 agreement of individual ratings, given 102 of
 151 episodes coded for reliability, = .85(K =
 .82).

 An aggregate measure of situational re-
 sponse to emotion, hereafter called the struc-
 tured prosocial aggregate, was created by
 summing standard scores for prosocial ratings
 of situational response to child and adult emo-
 tion; Cronbach's alpha = .56.

 Susanne A. Denham 197

 The following particular categories of be-
 havior were observed, and operationally
 defined as follows:

 1. Emotion displays: happy, sad, angry,

 or hurt, operationally defined according to
 broad facial, vocal, and motor indices that cap-
 tured their social meaning.

 2. Reactions to peers' emotions displays:

 A mutually exclusive and exhaustive coding
 system was devised as follows: (a) emitting
 same emotion (matching); (b) verbal or physi-
 cal reinforcement (including touching, hug-
 ging, approaching, or maintaining proximity);
 (c) sharing (offering, showing allowing tempo-
 rary use, or giving an object previously in pos-
 session); (d) helping (verbal or physical, in-
 cluding defending, stopping an offensive
 activity, giving information or strategies, assis-
 tance with tasks, or getting, giving, moving
 object not in previous possession); (e) care/
 concern (physical comforting, questioning,
 reassuring, or looking quite concerned); (f)

 sustained neutral attention (- 3 sec); (g) leav-
 ing the area; (h) ignoring; (i) other (usually
 discrepant emotions, e.g., anger in response
 to a happy display).

 Two raters coded videotaped segments of
 free play from both day-care classes. These
 segments coded for reliability included ap-
 proximately one-third of all emotion events
 coded (including those where no target chil-
 dren were nearby), or 137 events. The kappa
 statistic for reliability of event occurrence
 (i.e., emotion display of focal child) was .89.
 Given agreement on event occurrence, kap-
 pas for categorization of emotion and reaction
 to emotion were .84 overall and .95 and .64 for
 emotion and reaction to emotion categories,
 respectively.

 Observational.-To measure prosocial
 behaviors that children emit in unma-
 nipulated free-play situations, event record-
 ing was undertaken using a combination of
 focal child/right-left scanning techniques (see
 Altmann, 1974). The focal child's emotion
 displays (happy, sad, angry, or hurt), as well
 as the reactions of target children nearby,
 were recorded. Thus several focal children at
 a time were scanned from left to right across
 their free-play area; when one emitted an
 emotion display, it was recorded, as were the
 reactions of any target children within earshot
 and/or sight of the focal child. Each child was
 observed as focal child for an average of 37.5
 min; amount of time observed as target child
 depended on how often each subject was in
 the proximity of other children.

 All observational variables were divided

 by number of observations as focal child, to
 equate for absence and create a rate measure
 more amenable to statistical analysis. Relative
 measures of each emotion (e.g., percentage
 happy) were also created by dividing fre-
 quency of each emotion by total frequency of
 emotion displays.

 Standard scores for the following reac-

 tions to emotions were summed for the obser-
 vational prosocial aggregate score: matching
 happy, reinforcing, helping, sharing, comfort-
 ing, and leaving angry displays, since this last
 action seemed to further social interchange in
 this group (Cronbach's alpha = .65). Reac-
 tions from peers to one's own emotion dis-
 plays were coded to determine the number
 and nature of prosocial response received
 from others. Last, the overall prosocial aggre-

 gate, which is equal to the sum of standard
 scores on all components of both the struc-
 tured and observational prosocial aggregates,
 was computed.

 In summary, results will be reported on
 for the following variables: cognitive perspec-
 five-taking; affective aggregate; structured,
 observational, and overall prosocial aggre-
 gates; percentage of happy, sad, angry, and
 hurt emotion displays; rate of emotion dis-
 plays, rate of ignoring, rate of prosocial behav-
 ior, and rate of prosocial behavior received
 from others. Frequency data for all emotion
 and prosocial categories will also be reported.

 Subjects responded to peers' happy dis-
 plays with behaviors included in the observa-
 tional prosocial aggregate more often than ex-
 pected by chance, x (1) = 44.41, p < .001;
 specifically, Sackett's binomial Z technique
 (1979) indicates that such happy displays
 were more often matched or reinforced (Z's =
 8.25, 3.56), and less often followed by help,
 concern, leaving, other, or ignoring, than ex-
 pected by chance (Z's = -2.88, -2.96,
 - 3.33, - 2.65, - 2.07). Angry displays were,
 overall, less often responded to prosocially
 than expected by chance, X2(1) = 20.32, p <
 .001; specifically, they more often led to leav-
 ing, and less often led to matching, reinforce-
 ment, than expected by chance (Z's = 4.05,
 -3.25, -2.61). Sad displays were less often
 responded to prosocially than expected by
 chance, X2(1) = 7.10, p < .01; specifically,
 they were more often ignored, or followed by
 discrepant emotions, and less often matched,
 than expected by chance (Z's = 2.33, 3.19,
 -3.25). Hurt displays were more often fol-
 lowed by concern, and less often matched,
 than expected by chance (Z's = 6.61, -4.71).
 Thus peers' emotion displays generally
 elicited logical and adaptive responses.
 Relationship of Social Cognitive and Social
 Behavior Variables

 Correlation coefficients for social cogni-
 tive and major social behavior variables are
 presented in Table 2.

 Social cognitive variables.-Understand-
 ing of emotion in the puppet situation, as
 reflected by the affective aggregate, was
 significantly related to overall prosocial be-
 havior in the more structured situations (r =
 .51, p < .02; all probability levels two-tailed).
 This relation may be more evident in struc-
 tured situations due to the existence of fewer
 conflicting motivations than during free play.
 Cognitive perspective-taking was highly
 related to affective perspective-taking (r =
 .55, p < .02) but less strongly related to the
 overall prosocial behavior aggregate; the dif-

 Results

 Social Cognitive Predictions

 Results indicated that 2- and 3-year-old

 children could identify puppets' emotions on
 the tasks of the affective aggregate, although
 much individual variation remained (mean =
 15.43, SD = 8.47; significantly greater than a
 chance score of 7, p < .01). Subjects' verbali-
 zations indicated that they understood the
 task but deliberated on self-other distinctions
 in grappling with inference-making (e.g., a
 subject selected correct facial expressions for
 the puppet while saying in a puzzlement,
 "But I wouldn't feel that way!"). The mean
 cognitive perspective-taking score was signif-
 icantly greater than the chance score of 2.5
 (mean = 3.28, SD = 1.36; p < .05).
 Prosocial Behavior Predictions

 Subjects responded differently, and often
 prosocially, to different emotions. As shown
 in Table l's group behavior transition matrix
 of prosocial behaviors observed during free
 play (following Castellan, 1978), the nonran-
 domness of the differential responses to the
 four emotions coded is significant, X2(24) =
 211.26, p < .001. This chi-square yields a
 Cramer's V of .43, denoting a fairly strong as-
 sociation between particular emotion and par-
 ticular prosocial response.

 Discussion

 Prevalent emotion variables.-Children

 who exhibited relatively more happy emotion
 displays in the free-play observation were
 also more likely to obtain higher scores on
 affective tasks (r = .62, p < .003). The relation
 between percentage angry and the affective
 aggregate was significantly negative (p < .03).
 Children who showed anger displays rela-
 tively more often also ignored their peers'
 emotion displays more often (r = .53, p <
 .01).

 As predicted, these research findings
 support anecdotal evidence regarding affec-
 tive perspective-taking provided by other re-
 searchers (Borke, 1972; Hoffman, 1975); that
 is, children showed both nonegocentric and
 inferential abilities to understand others' feel-
 ings, as well as cognitive perspective-taking
 abilities, at a greater than chance level. These
 results probably differ from other experimen-
 tal evidence with slightly older children (cf.
 Grove & Keating, 1979) because of the inten-
 tionally contextualized nature of the perspec-
 tive-taking measures.

 The correlation of the overall prosocial
 behavior aggregate and percentage happy
 was .52 (p < .02). Conversely, the correlation
 of the overall prosocial behavior aggregate
 and percentage angry was -.27 (p > .05). The
 difference between the correlation coeffi-
 cients was significant (p < .001).

 Prevalence of hurt emotion displays was
 negatively related to affective aggregate
 scores (r = -.58, p < .002) and marginally to
 cognitive perspective-taking (r = -.37, p <
 .10). Prevalence of sad displays was mar-
 ginally negatively related to the overall proso-
 cial aggregate (r = -.44, p < .06).

 Those who emitted more emotion dis-

 plays per observation overall were more
 likely to exhibit prosocial behaviors in free
 play (r = .40, p < .04), though not in the
 structured situation. They were also more
 likely to ignore emotion displays in free play
 (r = .48, p < .01) and to leave angry displays
 (r = .47, p < .01). Those who received more
 prosocial behaviors from others in response to
 their own emotion displays in free play were
 marginally likely to be more prosocial them-
 selves (r = .34, p < .09).

 It was also clear, as predicted, that chil-

 dren in this age range responded differen-
 tially, and often positively, to different emo-
 tions. These results are congruent with those
 of Zahn-Waxler and Radke-Yarrow (1982); in
 this study, like that of Zahn-Waxler and
 Radke-Yarrow, about one-third of all observa-
 tional distress emotion displays were re-
 sponded to prosocially.

 Specific patterns of responses to emo-

 tions reported in Table 1 are also similar to
 those found by Strayer (1980) with a some-
 what older subject sample; she, too, found
 much matching of happy displays and con-
 cern to hurt displays, for example. This youn-
 ger sample showed a different response pat-
 tern to sad and angry peer emotions,
 however; in particular, sad emotions were of-
 ten ignored in this study. Happy and angry
 emotion displays, which were often re-
 sponded to rather than ignored, may be high-
 energy emotions that children at this age
 level find easy to perceive and respond to,
 similar to the anger and affection displays to

 References

 Feshbach (1979) has proposed several re-

 quirements for empathy that could also be
 seen as correlates of prosocial behavior.
 These include affective perspective-taking,
 affective capacity (the expression of a variety
 of emotions), and affective responsiveness
 (expression of emotions in general). Hoffman
 (1975) also postulates developmental transfor-
 mations of perspective-taking as bases of em-
 pathy. The results here showing correlations
 of prosocial behavior with affective perspec-
 tive-taking, emotionality, and prevalence of
 happy displays provide strong support for
 these theoretical views of empathy and proso-
 cial behavior but do so at an earlier age level
 than either theorist cited above presumes.

 Some of the strongest findings reported
 here involve prevalent mood and tempera-
 ment. Results on happy and angry displays
 uphold the theoretical notion that prosocial
 behavior is more likely when affect is positive
 or emotional needs are met (Hoffman, 1975;
 Strayer, 1980). Even at this early age, it is
 clearly important to know something about
 the child's temperament, as well as social cog-
 nitive abilities, to predict prosocial behavior
 with peers. Children who showed predomi-
 nantly negative emotions, whether sad or an-
 gry or hurt, showed varying deficits in social
 cognitive and/or prosocial domains. In partic-
 ular, greater prevalence of angry emotion dis-
 plays was related, often significantly, to lesser
 social cognitive abilities and prosocial re-
 sponding.

 Overall emotionality was also high-
 lighted as a correlate of prosocial behavior in
 free play. Hoffman (1975) suggested that al-
 truism is fostered by experiencing some, but
 not too much, distress oneself; it is possible
 that more emotional children are sensitized to
 emotion and are more likely to learn reactions
 to emotion from caretakers. They may also,
 however, be so sensitive that they sometimes
 need to leave the field (by actually going
 away or by ignoring), and may be more in-
 hibited in the structured situation.

 Finally, individual differences existed,
 warranting further investigation with a larger
 sample. Several children emitted very few
 emotions, responded very rarely to peer's
 emotions, and showed little social cognitive
 ability. Particular profiles of these measures
 might distinguish such children from others,
 as do Lewis and Michalson's emotional
 profiles (1983).
