Understanding Others, and Individual
Differences in Friendship Interactions in Young
Children

Abstract

Links  between  individual  differences  in  4-year-olds’  social  understanding,  language
abilities,  temperament,  behavioral  adjustment  and  family  background  and  the  quality
of their interaction with a close friend were investigated. 64 pairs of friends were ﬁlmed
playing together on two occasions, and each child tested on a battery of assessments of
theory of mind, emotion understanding and language. Teachers and mothers reported
on children’s adjustment and temperament respectively. There were marked differences
in children’s interactions with their friends; the sociocognitive abilities and behavioral
characteristics of both child and friend contributed signiﬁcantly to cooperative shared
pretend, to low frequency of conﬂict and to successful communication between friends;
behavioral adjustment and family background also contributed independently to friend-
ship quality. The similarity between friends in behavioral adjustment and sociolinguistic
skills was notable.

Keywords: Theory of mind; friendship; language

How  are  individual  differences  in  young  children’s  understanding  of  other  minds
and of emotions related to their real-life interactions with other children? The devel-
opmental  changes  that  take  place  between  two  and  ﬁve  years  in  children’s  under-
standing of the links between people’s inner states and their actions are striking, and
this understanding is of central signiﬁcance not only for cognitive development but
also  for  children’s  social  relationships  (Astington,  1994;  Baron-Cohen,  1994).
Children’s capacities for empathy, for understanding how to comfort or to frustrate,
for  sharing  imaginative  worlds,  for  deceiving  and  teasing,  and  for  negotiation  and
compromise in conﬂict are all linked to their growing understanding of the connec-
tions between what people want or believe and their behavior.

To  begin  to  document  the  nature  of  the  links  between  the  development  of
preschool children’s understanding of others and the quality of their close relation-
ships with other children, we need research that investigates individual differences in
mindreading  and  emotion  understanding  and  their  association  with  differences  in
friendship  quality.  To  date,  relatively  little  research  has  examined  connections
between individual differences in understanding of inner states and social behavior.
A  particular  gap  has  been  in  the  study  of  close  friendships  in  young  children.  We

know  something  of  the  connections  between  social  understanding  and  children’s
popularity  and  rejection  within  peer  group  settings  (Rubin,  Bukowski,  &  Parker,
1997),  their  social  competence  in  the  classroom  as  judged  by  teachers  (Lalonde  &
Chandler, 1995), their engagement in joint pretend play in group settings (Astington
&  Jenkins,  1995),  and  the  links  between  preschoolers’  affective  perspective  taking
skills  and  their  social  behavior  in  group  settings  (Denham,  1986;  Denham,
McKinley,  Couchoud  &  Holt,  1990).  It  has  been  argued  that  differences  in  emo-
tional understanding mediate the links between family relationships and difﬁculties
in peer relations (Cassidy, Parke, Butkowsky, & Braungart, 1992).

But there has been as yet little systematic research on how the quality of young
children’s interactions in close relationships with other children are related to differ-
ences in their understanding of inner states. Here we investigated links between chil-
dren’s social understanding and the quality of their interactions with their friends in
a sample of urban children from a wide range of social backgrounds. Information on
sociocognitive and language ability, temperament, behavior problems, parental edu-
cation  and  family  background  was  available  for  both  children  in  each  friendship
dyad. The children’s sociocognitive and language development was studied in detail
(Cutting & Dunn, 1998), with a battery of tasks concerning theory of mind, decep-
tion,  emotion  understanding,  vocabulary  and  narrative  abilities.  Our  goal  was  to
examine the relations between these aspects of social cognition, language ability and
children’s communication, conﬂict and cooperation in play with their friends. Thus
we focussed on detailed observation of the children’s friendship interaction, rather
than on reports of broad positive and negative dimensions of friendship.

Interaction Between Friends

Friendships in early childhood are receiving increasing attention from researchers and
clinicians. Such relationships can be formed very early in the preschool period, show
considerable  stability  (Howes,  1988,  1996;  Howes,  Droege  &  Mathesen,  1994),  and
can provide signiﬁcant sources of support for children undergoing potentially stressful
changes such as the transition to school (Ladd & Kochenderfer, 1996), or the family
disruption accompanying the birth of a sibling (Gottman, 1986; Kramer & Gottman,
1992). Friendships provide a context in which children’s social and moral development
may  be  fostered,  but  the  developmental  signiﬁcance  of  the  relationship  is  likely  to
depend on the quality of the friendship (Hartup, 1996). Yet individual differences in
friendships between young children have been relatively little studied.

The aspects of interaction between the friends which we investigated here included
ﬁrst,  children’s  engagement  in  joint  pretence  with  their  friends.  The  sharing  of  an
imaginative  framework  constitutes  a  kind  of  intimacy  between  very  young  friends
(Howes, 1996; Howes, Unger, & Mathesen, 1992; Parker & Gottman, 1989), evident
well before the explicit verbal disclosures of later friendships. Pretend play between
friends  is  more  sustained  and  harmonious  than  play  between  acquaintances
(Gottman & Parkhurst, 1980; Howes, Droege, & Mathesen, 1994), and the ability to
‘play’ with pretence has been shown to be importantly linked to the understanding
of mental states (Harris & Kavanaugh, 1993; Hughes & Dunn, 1997; Leslie, 1987).

Second, the frequency of play that did not involve pretence but was coordinated
between both partners was documented—in view of Gottman’s (1986) emphasis on
coordinated play as the core feature of friends’ interaction in early childhood. Third,
we recorded conﬂict between the children—known to differ markedly across friend-

ships  in  older  children  (Hartup,  1992).  Fourth,  we  focussed  on  the  quality  of
amity—the sharing of amusement and positive affect (Gottman, 1983). In addition,
we  examined  the  children’s  ‘failures’  in  communication  with  their  friends,  their
unsuccessful bids for attention, and their own lack of responsiveness to their friends’
attempts at joint play or conversation.

Links Between Differences in Friendship Interaction and Children’s Characteristics

It is likely, of course, that individual differences in friends’ interactions are related to
a  wide  range  of  factors,  including  family  relationships  (Herrera  &  Dunn,  1997;
Kerns, 1994; Kahen, Fainsilber-Katz, & Gottman, 1994). This study was a ﬁrst step
in examining one set of such correlates. Our predictions were ﬁrst that the theory of
mind and emotion understanding skills of both child and friend would be related to
the children’s engagement in pretend play, and to the relative ‘success’ of children’s
communication.  Second,  temperamental  characteristics  (speciﬁcally  shyness  and
negative emotionality) and behavioral problems (such as hyperactivity) of both child
and partner were also predicted to be associated with high rates of failures in com-
munication between friends, and with frequency of conﬂict moves towards friends.
The extent to which these connections would be dependent on the children’s linguis-
tic  skills  or  sociocognitive  abilities  was  a  matter  for  investigation.  While  social
understanding is clearly implicated in how children behave during disputes (Dunn &
Herrera,  1997)  it  is  not  clear  that  the  amount of  conﬂict  between  friends  is  also
related to their sociocognitive abilities. Third, we predicted that sociocognitive abili-
ties  would  not  be  related  to  the  children’s  expression  of  shared  positive  affect  and
excitement with their friends—the amity in their interaction—given the evidence of a
study  by  Maguire  and  Dunn  (1997),  but  that  children’s  temperament  and  adjust-
ment would be important here. Shy children and those who were likely to become
easily distressed or angry, those with attention and overactivity problems, were pre-
dicted to show less amity towards their friends.

In summary, our aims were, ﬁrst, to describe the nature and range of individual
differences in children’s interactive behavior with their friends; second, to examine
the links between these differences and the children’s individual characteristics both
in terms of individual correlations, and in terms of the combined and unique vari-
ance in interaction measures explained by these variables. A third aim was to docu-
ment the signiﬁcance of partner’s characteristics for children’s interaction with their
friends, again in terms of combined and unique variance explained.

Method

Participants

128 children (63 girls, 65 boys) with a mean age of 4.16 years (range 3.49–4.80 years)
participated in the study. The children attended nursery schools in South London,
and came about equally from middle class and working class backgrounds—the lat-
ter  included  considerable  urban  deprivation.  68%  were  White,  26%  were  Black  or
Mixed race, and 6% were from other ethnic groups. Children were recruited to the
sample if they had a close friend: identiﬁcation of friends was on the basis of three
criteria—they were named as reciprocal friends by their teachers, and their mothers,
and  were  behaviorally  identiﬁed  as  friends  following  the  observational  criteria  of

Howes  and  Phillipsen,  (1992).  Two  observations  were  conducted  for  each  target
child (i.e., 4 observations for the dyad) one week apart; each observation involved
scans in which the target child was observed for 30 seconds, at intervals of 90 sec-
onds,  for  a  30-minute  period.  Children  were  identiﬁed  as  friends  if  they  were
observed to maintain proximity within 3 feet of each other, to be engaged in inter-
active social play, and to engage in shared positive affect during at least 30% of the
combined observations of the two children.

Procedure

After  the  scanning  and  recruitment  procedures,  each  child  was  seen  twice  at  the
nursery  and  once  at  home.  A  battery  of  theory  of  mind,  language  and  emotion
understanding tasks was administered over the course of these visits. Two 20-minute
videotaped observations of the child and friend playing alone together were also car-
ried  out,  on  average  one  week  apart;  each  dyad  was  ﬁlmed  playing  together  in  a
room with no-one else present, with a set of dressing up clothes and toys provided by
the  experimenter  (Gottman,  1983).  Information  on  children’s  adjustment  was  col-
lected from teachers, on family background and temperamental characteristics from
parents during the home visit. Some children did not complete every task for a vari-
ety of reasons (e.g., absence from school) so the N varied slightly across tests.

Theory of Mind and Deception Tasks

An aggregate score of children’s success on a total of seven theory of mind tasks (all
of which involved predicting, explaining or recalling a false belief), and a deception
task was employed. For details of these see Cutting and Dunn (1998).

Unexpected  Location  Tasks.  Four  unexpected-location  stories  with  puppets  were
used, based on those of Bartsch and Wellman (1989): two required the explanation,
and  two  the  prediction  of  a  character’s  action  based  on  false  belief.  All  stories
involved a plain and an archetypal box, the archetypal contents being in the plain
box.  In  the  explanation  stories,  children  scored  two  points  if  they  spontaneously
referred to a mistaken belief in explaining the puppet’s action and passed the reality
control question, 1 point if they referred to a mistaken belief after prompting (‘What
does he think?’) and passed the reality control question, and 0 points if no clear ref-
erence was made to a mistaken belief. In the prediction task, the children were asked
to predict in which of the two boxes the puppet would look. They were coded as suc-
cessful if they responded correctly to both the test question and the reality control
question (‘Will (puppet) ﬁnd the Lego/cereal there?’).

Current False-Belief Tasks. Children heard two stories based on Harris, Johnson,
Hutton, Andrews and Cooke (1989), involving a surprise. One involved a nasty sur-
prise, in which a character exchanged his friend’s favorite drink for a disliked drink
when his friend was away. The second involved a nice surprise, in which a character
exchanged  a  friend’s  disliked  food  for  liked  food,  again  in  the  friend’s  absence.
Children  were  credited  with  success  on  each  task  if  they  correctly  stated  what  the
friend thought he was getting to eat/drink, and what he was really getting. Children
were also asked to state a character’s current false belief using the ‘Can’t sleep’ task
(Moerbeek, 1994; see Cutting & Dunn, 1998 for details).

Deception Task. The deception task used was Sodian and Frith’s (1992) one-box
puppet deception game; four kinds of trial are involved: non-verbal and verbal coop-

eration  with  a  ‘nice’  princess  puppet,  and  non-verbal  and  verbal  competition  (i.e.,
sabotage and deception) with a ‘mean’ burglar puppet. The Sodian and Frith proce-
dures  were  followed,  with  the  test  trials  presented  in  counter-balanced  order.
Following Sodian and Frith’s criteria, the child gained 2 points if successful on all
four test trials, 1 point if s/he failed the verbal deceit and cooperation but managed
nonverbal deceit and cooperation, and 0 for any other pattern of performance.

Aggregate  Score  on  Theory  of  Mind/Deception.  Children  scored  1  point  for  each
false  belief  task  passed,  except  for  the  explanation  tasks  where  2  points  were
awarded  (1  for  prompted  explanations),  and  up  to  2  points  in  the  deception  task.
Intertask  correlations  for  the  theory  of  mind  scores  were  high  (Cutting  &  Dunn,
1998),  with  virtually  every  task  correlating  above  p , .01  with  every  other  task
(Cronbach’s alpha for all 8 tasks 5 .80). An aggregate score for each child was cal-
culated as number of points scored divided by the maximum number of points the
child could have scored (excluding missing tasks and tasks in which the child failed
the control). A wide range of individual differences was apparent (Table 1).

Affective Perspective-Taking. Denham’s (1986) procedures were employed: In this
study we used the affective perspective-taking score, which is based on 16 vignettes
enacted by a puppet (matched to the child for gender and race), in which the protag-
onist feels happiness, sadness, anger or fear. The ﬁrst 8 of the vignettes reﬂect what
most children typically feel in a given situation. In the other 8 vignettes the puppet’s
emotion differed from the emotion that the mother said the child typically expressed
in such a situation. At the end of each story children were asked how the puppet felt;
they  could  respond  verbally  or  nonverbally  by  selecting  one  of  four  faces.  Two
points were scored for correct identiﬁcation, one for the correct valence but wrong
speciﬁc emotion (e.g., ‘sad’ instead of ‘afraid’). Scores were summed for all vignettes
(maximum score 5 32). Cronbach’s alpha 5 .73.

Emotion  Understanding  Within  Relationships.  A  second  procedure,  based  on  an
interview used by Cassidy (Cassidy et al., 1992), focussed on children’s accounts of
causes of emotion in their mothers, themselves, and their friends (Dunn & Hughes,
1998). Children were shown faces representing four emotions (happy, sad, angry and
scared). After they had correctly identiﬁed each emotion, children were asked what
made  themselves,  their  mother  and  their  friends  feel  each  emotion  (see  Dunn  &
Hughes, 1998, for details); responses were tape-recorded and transcribed verbatim.
The  adequacy of  their  response  was  coded  on  a  5-point  scale  in  which  0  5 no
response, refusal, denial; 2 5 adequate response, which included one word or simple
clause only, but appropriate and plausible response; 4 5 excellent, including elabo-
rate response or evidence of insight. Scores were summed across all 4 emotions and 3
people  to  give  a  total  emotion  understanding  score.  Agreement  on  coding  was
assessed by two coders rating transcripts from 25 children; Cohen’s kappa was 0.87.

Language Measures

Children’s  verbal  skills  were  assessed  using  measures  of  both  receptive  vocabulary
(long form of the British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS); Dunn, Dunn, Whetton,
& Pintilie, 1982), and narrative expressive language ability (The Bus Story, Renfrew,
1991). The Bus Story involves the child retelling a simple story about a bus from a
picture book. The child’s story is transcribed verbatim; the primary measure of nar-
rative  ability  is  ‘information’  (the  content  and  coherence  of  the  story),  which  we
employ in this study.

Family Background
Parental educational level was classiﬁed thus: 4 5 college degree or higher, 3 5 up to
A  level  (equivalent  to  high  school  graduation  in  the  US),  25 up  to  GCSE/O  level
(national  examinations  taken  at  15/16  years),  1  5 no  qualiﬁcations.  Occupational
class  was  classiﬁed  using  the  Standard  Occupational  Classiﬁcation  (Ofﬁce  of
Population Censuses and Surveys, 1991), as follows: I5 professional, II 5 manager-
ial  or  technical  (e.g.,  teacher,  computer  analyst),  IIIN  5 skilled,  nonmanual  (e.g.,
secretary, ﬁnancial clerk), IIIM 5 skilled manual (e.g., hairdresser, carpenter), IV 5
semi-skilled (e.g., security guard), V 5 unskilled (e.g., cleaner, laborer). Information
was gathered for mothers and fathers; 22% of the families were mother-only families.
We report here ﬁndings related to mothers’ education and occupation; the pattern of
ﬁndings was highly similar for paternal occupation and education. Overall, the sam-
ple was 48% working class and 52% middle class.

Temperament

Children’s  temperament  was  reported  by  mothers,  using  the  20-item  Colorado
Childhood Temperament Inventory (CCTI; Rowe & Plomin, 1977); given space con-
straints we include here the ﬁndings on two of the 4 subscales with particular rele-
vance  to  friendship  interactions:  shyness  and  negative  emotionality.  Cronbach’s
alpha for shyness was .75, for emotionality was .80.

Children’s Behavioral Adjustment

Children’s behavioral adjustment was assessed by both teachers and parents with the
Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997), a 25-item behav-
ioral  screening  questionnaire  providing  coverage  of  children’s  behavior,  emotions
and peer relations, comprising 5 scales of 5 items each, each item rated on a 3-point
scale. Given space constraints we include here ﬁndings on two of these scales with
particular  relevance  for  friendship 
interactions,  as  completed  by  teachers:
Hyperactivity (which included items on inattentiveness, activity and restlessness: dif-
ﬁculties  in  close  relationships  with  peers  are  a  central  problem  for  children  with
attentional  and  activity  problems,  Hinshaw  &  Melnick,  1995);  Prosocial  behavior
(which included items on kindness, consideration, helping those who are hurt, and
sharing). Validation of the SDQ, with comparison of parent and teacher ratings is
reported  in  Goodman  (1997).  Cronbach’s  alpha  for  Hyperactivity  was  .84,  for
Prosocial was .87.

Observation Measures of Interactive Behavior

The interactive behavior of the children was coded from their conversation during
the  two  observations,  transcribed  from  the  videotaped  recording.  The  coding  was
based on speaker turns (all of a speaker’s utterances that are bounded by the utter-
ances of another speaker, or by a pause of more than 20 seconds). The transcription
included contextual information from the videotapes, such as pretend actions, non-
verbal behavior such as physical aggression or provocation, helping actions, shaking
head (‘no’) or nodding (‘yes’), the joint focus of attention or disagreement over toys,
joint actions such as running around together, singing together, and the expression

Friends 207

of positive affect or negative affect. The mean number of child’s audible conversa-
tion  turns  was  159  (S.D.  54.6).  Measures  are  expressed  as  proportion  of  speaker
turns (with the exception of amity see below).

The  coding  system  assessed  the  frequency  of  the  following  features  (Gottman,
1983; Maguire & Dunn, 1997). Cooperative pretend play: discussing a joint pretend
plan or game, taking a pretend role as part of a joint pretend narrative, or following
a  pretend  suggestion  of  the  other  child.  Coordinated  play: explicitly  or  implicitly
agreeing with the other child’s action suggestion, inquiring what the other wanted to
do, agreeing with a ‘we’ demand or tag question, joining in activity initiated by the
other; it did not include joint pretend play which was coded as cooperative pretend
play.  Conﬂict:  prohibiting  another’s  action,  disagreement,  protest,  threat,  insult  or
refusal of a request. Three further measures reﬂected communication failure or suc-
cess:  Bids for  attention  or  response  to  which  the  other  child  failed  to  respond:
explicit demands for attention, help or cooperation that were ignored. Unresponsive:
failing  to  respond  to  a  comment  or  bid.  Connected  communication: speaker’s  turn
was  semantically  related  to  the  previous  speaker’s  turn,  but  not  already  coded  as
cooperative pretend, coordinated play, or conﬂict. These codes were mutually exclu-
sive. Finally Amity: a child explicitly validated or approved the friend, afﬁrmed the
friendship,  expressed  affection,  joined  in  joking,  laughing  or  shared  deviance  with
amusement;  joint  singing,  shouting  was  included.  Amity  was  coded  as  an  event,
rather  than  as  a  speaker  turn,  as  these  episodes  were  of  variable  length,  and
expressed as a proportion of the time the children were together.

Agreement  on  coding  of  the  transcripts  (assessed  by  two  coders  independently
coding transcripts of 24 children) was as follows. Cooperative pretend play: Kappa
.82, rs .95; coordinated play: Kappa .63, rs .81; conﬂict: kappa .77, rs .88; connected
conversation: kappa .72, rs .82; bids: kappa .79, rs .81; unresponsive: kappa .80, rs
.85; amity:rs .92 (kappa not appropriate for this category as it was an event coding
of variable length).

Results

First, descriptive statistics on children’s characteristics and behavior towards friends
are  reported.  Second,  correlations  between  the  children’s  interactive  behavior  with
their friends, and characteristics of children and their friends are reported. Third, the
combined  and  unique  variance  in  selected  interaction  variables  explained  by  child
and friend characteristics are investigated using multiple regression analyses.

Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for children’s characteristics, hyperactivity and
prosocial behavior, and mothers’ education and occupational class. Intra-class corre-
lations between child and friend for these measures were conducted as appropriate for
analyses in which there are not two independent classes, and Table 1 shows low posi-
tive  correlations  between  child  and  friend  on  vocabulary  score,  theory  of  mind  and
shyness,  and  higher  positive  correlations  on  hyperactivity  and  prosocial,  and  on
maternal  education  and  occupational  class.  Gender  differences  were  tested  for  with 
t-tests. A marginally signiﬁcant difference was found on the theory of mind aggregate,
with girls scoring higher; a marked gender difference was found on the hyperactivity
scale (boys: mean of 3.72 (SD1.88), girls: mean 2.10 (SD 1.88).

Table  2  shows  descriptive  statistics  for  the  observational  measures,  and  correla-
tions between these variables. Individual differences on these measures were marked.
Note  that  children  who  were  relatively  frequently  making  ‘bids’  to  which  their
friends  did  not  respond  were  also  likely  to  be  unresponsive  to  their  friends’  com-
ments, and unlikely to engage frequently in cooperative pretend, or in coordinated
play. Children who made frequent cooperative pretend play moves not only had a
low rate of ‘failed’ communication in terms of bids and unresponsiveness, but were
unlikely to be in conﬂict with their friends. They were also less likely to engage in
connected  conversations  that  were  not  focussed  on  play  or  shared  activities.
Engagement  in  coordinated  play  (which  excluded  shared  fantasy)  was  correlated
with amity—with these children there was much joint laughter and running around
together.

Intraclass correlations between child and friend were positive but modest for bids,
higher  for  conﬂict,  and  substantial  for  unresponsiveness,  connected  conversation,
pretend, coordinated play and amity.

Links with Child Characteristics

Table 3 shows ﬁrst, that as predicted, children’s theory of mind, affective perspec-
tive-taking skills and emotion understanding were correlated with their cooperative
pretend play turns, as were their language skills and their mothers’ educational level
and  occupational  class.  Children  who  had  been  rated  as  high  on  the  hyperactivity
scale engaged less frequently in joint pretend with their friends.

Second, also as predicted, children scoring high on the mindreading measure were
less likely to make failed ‘bids’ for communication with their friends or to be unre-
sponsive,  though  the  emotion  understanding  and  language  measures  were  not
related  to  these  aspects  of  communication.  The  good  mindreaders  and  those  who
scored  high  on  emotion  understanding  also  talked  more  to  their  friends.
Emotionality  and  hyperactivity  were  correlated  with  frequent  failed  bids,  and  low
maternal education and occupational class were also implicated. Lack of responsive-
ness to friends was correlated with shyness and low maternal education.

Third,  conﬂict  behavior  was  more  frequently  shown  by  the  children  who  per-
formed relatively poorly on theory of mind, and affective perspective-taking, those
whose narrative abilities were less well developed, and by the younger children in the
sample. As predicted, the more hyperactive were in more conﬂict with their friends.
Fourth, child characteristics were not related to amity.

Links with Friend Characteristics

Table 4 shows some aspects of children’s social behavior towards their friends were
related  to  the  sociocognitive  abilities,  temperament,  hyperactivity  and  prosocial
behavior, and family background of those friends.

Thus, friends’ theory of mind, emotion understanding, and language scores, and
their  mothers’  education  and  occupational  level  were  all  positively  related  (and
friends’  hyperactivity  negatively  related)  to  children’s  cooperative  pretend  moves.
Second, friends’ theory of mind scores were also negatively correlated with the fre-
quency of children’s unsuccessful bids. Friends’ theory of mind and emotion under-
standing  scores  were  also  correlated  with  the  amount  the  children  talked  to  them
during  the  observations,  while  shy,  hyperactive  or  younger  friends  were  talked  to
less.

Third, children made more frequent conﬂict moves with friends with low affective
perspective-taking skills, and also with friends. Fourth, children showed less amity
towards those friends who were easily upset or anxious. Finally, children made more
frequent coordinated play moves (non-pretend) with friends who scored high on the
hyperactivity scale, though they talked to them less than to friends who scored lower
on this scale.

Regression Analyses Predicting Combined and Unique Variance in Observational
Measures

Next we investigated the combined and unique contribution of the various child and
friend characteristics to the variance in children’s observed behavior with a series of
multiple regressions. The focus was on those child behaviors which were signiﬁcantly
related  to  a  number  of  different  characteristics,  namely  cooperative  pretend  play,
bids,  and  conﬂict.  There  were  three  steps  in  these  analyses.  First,  the  independent
contributions  to  the  variance  in  behavioral  outcome  of  child  characteristics  was
examined  with  stepwise  regressions  in  which  each  variable  was  systematically
removed  in  turn  in  the  second  step.  Second,  similar  two-step  regression  analyses
were  conducted  with  friend  characteristics  as  predictors.  Third,  the  combined  and
separate  contributions  of  child  and  friend  characteristics  as  a  whole  were  investi-
gated, with the child characteristics entered together as one step, and friend charac-
teristics  entered  together  as  a  second  step,  and  vice  versa,  in  order  to  determine

of analyses are summarised, and the results of the third set are given in Table 5.

Child’s Cooperative Pretend Moves

To predict cooperative pretend play, child’s theory of mind, emotion understanding,
vocabulary score, hyperactivity, and mother’s education, and the same variables for
the friend were selected. Child characteristics were entered together as one step, and
21% of the variance was explained (F (5, 109) 5 5.65, p , .001). When the unique
variance ascribed to each child variable was examined, by systematically taking out
each  variable  in  the  second  step,  the  changes  in  R  squared  showed  that  5.7%  of 
the variance was uniquely attributable to mother’s education (p , .01), but that the
other  variables  did  not  contribute  signiﬁcant  independent variance.  That  is,  the
shared variance of the child characteristics was marked.

Second, the contribution of friend characteristics was considered. Friend variables
entered  ﬁrst  as  a  group  explained  20.3%  of  the  variance  in  children’s  cooperative
pretend play (F (5, 109) 5 5.54, p , .001); when the unique variance ascribed to each
friend  variable  was  examined,  the  change  in  R  squared  was  signiﬁcant  only  for
friend’s  maternal  education:  variance  explained  was  5.8%.  Again,  the  shared  vari-
ance was high between the other variables.

In the third set of analyses, both child and friend variables were ﬁrst entered as a
group: 32% of the variance in cooperative pretend play was explained (F (10, 91) 5
4.30, p , .001). Then in 2 two-step analyses, child variables were entered together as
a ﬁrst step, and friend variables in a group as a second step, and vice versa. Results
(Table 5) showed that both child and friend characteristics made signiﬁcant unique

contributions  to  the  variance  in  children’s  cooperative  pretend  play  moves,  each
independently explaining 10% of the variance, while 12% of variance was shared.

Child’s Unsuccessful Bids for Response

Child  variables  selected  were  child  theory  of  mind,  child’s  emotionality,  child’s
mother’s education and occupational class; they accounted for 13% of the variance
in bids (F (4, 90) 5 3.29, p , .01). None of the variables made a signiﬁcant contribu-
tion to the variance independently of the others. Friend theory of mind entered in a
separate  analysis  (the  only  friend  variable  signiﬁcantly  correlated  with  bids)
accounted for 4% of the variance (F (1, 125) 5 5.13, p , .05).

In the third set of analyses, both child variables and friend theory of mind were
entered together as a group: 19% of the variance was explained (F (5, 89) 5 4.29, p ,
.001).  Then  the  unique  contributions  of  child  variables  and  friend  theory  of  mind
were  examined  with  two-step  analyses  (in  which  child  variables  were  entered  ﬁrst,
then friend variables, then the order of entry was reversed). Results (Table 5) showed
that friend theory of mind scores made a unique contribution, explaining 7% of the
variance in bids, while child characteristics together also contributed around 7%, but
this did not reach signiﬁcance. Around 5% of the variance was shared.

Child’s Conﬂict Moves

Child variables entered were child age, child’s theory of mind, affective perspective-
taking, narrative skills, and hyperactivity, together accounting for 16% of the vari-
ance,  (F (5,  111)  5 4.38,  p , .01).  The  stepwise  regression  showed  child’s
hyperactivity made an independent contribution 8.1% (p , .01). For the analysis of
friend’s  characteristics,  the  variables  were  friend  age,  friend  affective  perspective-
taking, and friend’s mother’s occupational class. Together these variables accounted
for 8% of the variance, (F (3, 111) 5 3.54, p , .05). None of these variables made a
signiﬁcant unique contribution to the variance.

In  the  third  set  of  analyses,  when  both  child  and  friend  variables  were  entered
together as a group, 21% of the variance was explained (F (8, 98) 5 3.19, p , .01).
The results (Table 5) showed that child characteristics contributed 11% of the vari-
ance,  independently  of  the  friend  characteristics,  whilst  friend  variables  only  con-
tributed 3% independent variance, and around 7% of the variance was shared.

Discussion

Three general issues were examined in this study: the nature of individual differences
in  young  children’s  friendships,  the  links  between  these  individual  differences  and
children’s sociocognitive and other characteristics, and the signiﬁcance of partner’s
characteristics in relation to children’s interactive moves.

Individual Differences in Friendship Interaction

This was a study of children who all had a reciprocal friend. Nevertheless, the friend-
ships of these 3- and 4-year-olds differed notably. Many of them shared an imagi-
nary world together with great skill and enjoyment. Within the conﬁnes of a small
room at school—where we ﬁlmed them playing—they created worlds of emotional

drama,  medical  emergencies,  high  romances,  parties,  crimes,  births  and  deaths,  as
well  as  quieter  domestic  narratives.  Those  who  frequently  created  make-believe
worlds  together  were  less  likely  to  quarrel,  or  to  fail  in  communicating  with  each
other than the other children in the study.

Other friends enjoyed cooperating in boisterous games, in shared deviance, or in
working out together how toys functioned, but relatively rarely created shared pre-
tence. As with the successful ‘pretenders’ they were less likely than the other children
to have frequent failures of communication with their friends. They were also likely
to join in shared amusement—the quality of ‘amity’ to which Gottman (1983, 1986)
drew attention. This amity was not related to the sharing of pretend worlds, or to
the frequency of ‘failed’ communication between child and friend.

Conﬂict  varied  greatly  between  friend  pairs.  Some  argued  and  quarrelled  with
their  friends  repeatedly,  whilst  for  others,  disputes  were  rare  and  quickly  resolved.
Although  conﬂict  was  less  common  among  the  children  who  participated  in  much
pretence, there were no links between amount of conﬂict and the other coordinated
play in which the children engaged, or unsuccessful bids for attention.

Our  overall  goal  here  was  to  investigate  how  children’s  abilities  to  read  others’
minds and understand emotions, their linguistic skills, temperament, adjustment and
family  background  were  linked  to  these  differences  in  the  interactions  with  their
friends.

Links with Children’s Social Understanding

First, the prediction that children’s sociocognitive and linguistic skills, assessed here
with a broad range of tests, would be related to shared pretend play was supported.
The children’s family background and the level of their mothers’ education were also
important. This pattern of correlations raises two questions. First, did the maternal
variables and the children’s characteristics make independent contributions to differ-
ences  in  children’s  interactive  behavior  with  their  friends?  Second,  what  might  the
processes  be  that  link  maternal  education  to  children’s  propensity  to  join  their
friends in pretence?

Maternal education contributed variance in the cooperative pretend play measure
that  was  independent  of  children’s  sociocognitive  and  language  measures,  but  the
latter measures shared variance in contributing to cooperative pretence. There are a
variety of possible processes that might mediate these links with maternal education.
For example, the more highly educated mothers may have interacted and talked to
children through the preschool years in ways that affected the children’s propensity
to engage in shared make-believe. Alternatively these mothers may have fostered the
children’s  relationships  with  their  friends  in  other  ways  that  indirectly  affected  the
children’s  propensity  to  share  pretend  worlds;  we  know  for  instance  that  parental
education  and  social  class  contributed  to  differences  in  social  understanding  inde-
pendently of children’s language and age (Cutting & Dunn, 1998).

Differences  in  social  understanding  were  also  implicated  in  a  low  frequency  of
conﬂict  between  friends,  while  children  high  on  the  hyperactivity  scale  were  more
often in disputes with their friends—an effect independent of the other variables that
associated with conﬂict differences—age, theory of mind and affective perspective-
taking skills, and expressive language.

The  smoothness  of  children’s  communication  with  their  friends  was  related  to
theory of mind skills, and also to emotionality, mothers’ education, and children’s

narrative skills, but not vocabulary. Failures in communication, that is, were more
closely related to the theory of mind scores than to vocabulary; interestingly, emo-
tion understanding was not correlated with communication failures: here some dif-
ferentiation  between  the  implications  of  mindreading  and  understanding  feelings
was indicated.

The prediction that amity shown to a friend would not be related to sociocognitive
and linguistic skills was supported. A surprise was that temperament was not associ-
ated  with  differences  in  amity,  and  that  there  was  a  negative  correlation  between
amity  and  friends’  prosocial  scores.  Indeed,  some  of  the  children  with  high  amity
scores were among the ‘naughtiest’—enjoying shared deviance (such as killing ﬂies
together). Another surprise was that connected conversation between the children—
talk not in the course of play or conﬂict—was not correlated with social understand-
ing.  These  conversations  were  frequently  focused  on  competitive  discussions,  or
claims  concerning  who  possessed  better  toys  at  home,  rather  than  the  sharing  of
thoughts,  feelings  or  gossip.  That  is,  this  talk  frequently  reﬂected  the  dynamics  of
social status and power between the children, rather than a ‘meeting of minds’.

Links with Friend Characteristics

The  third  issue  addressed  concerned  children’s  friends’  characteristics.  Two  sets  of
ﬁndings in the present study are of general developmental interest: ﬁrst, the similar-
ity of children and their friends in their characteristics, and second, the links between
friends’ skills and behavioral adjustment and children’s interactive behavior.

Similarity of Friends

The  children  we  studied  came  from  nursery  centres  and  schools  that  served  local
neighbourhoods and children were likely to come from quite similar backgrounds. It
is  not  perhaps  surprising  that  there  were  correlations  between  children  and  their
friends  in  terms  of  maternal  education  and  occupational  class.  More  interesting  is
the similarity in linguistic skill, adjustment and temperament (cf. ﬁndings on similar-
ities in friends’ shyness in third-grade children by Poulin, Cillesen, Hubbard, Coie,
Dodge,  &  Schwartz,  1997),  on  proactively  aggressive  children  (Poulin  &  Boivin,
1997), and on cognitive play style and social participation by Rubin, Lynch, Coplan,
Rose-Krasnor, & Booth,1994).

The  similarity  between  the  children  and  friends  on  their  vocabulary  scores  was
notable, while their understanding of emotion and mindreading abilities also tended
to  be  similar.  How  can  this  similarity  be  interpreted?  It  could  be  that  friendships
ﬂourish  when  children  share  capacities  for  and  interest  in  certain  kinds  of  play—
such as joint make believe, or shared deviance and antisocial acts; that is, children
may seek out similar children as friends. It could also be that friends inﬂuence each
other, and become more alike. Similarity for aggression is both an antecedent and a
consequence for friendship (Bukowski & Newcomb, 1993); similarity in the sociolin-
guistic  skills  implicated  in  joint  pretend  play  is  likely  to  be  important  both  as
antecedent  and  consequence  of  friendship  in  4-year-olds.  Clear  evidence  on  these
possibilities  for  older  children  has  been  difﬁcult  to  establish  (Hartup,  1996),  how-
ever,  increases  in  deviant  behavior  through  interactions  with  antisocial  friends  is
fairly well documented for children who are themselves at risk for antisocial behav-
ior (e.g., Berndt & Keefe, 1992; Dishion, Andrews, & Crosby, 1995).

Links Between Friends’ Characteristics and Children’s Interactive Behavior

The social understanding of the friends contributed notably to the variance in chil-
dren’s cooperative pretend moves—as much as 10% of the variance in children’s pre-
tend moves, independent of children’s own characteristics. Similarly, friends’ theory
of mind skills contributed an additional 7% of variance in failed bids. In contrast,
friends’  characteristics  did  not  contribute  independently  to  the  variance  in  conﬂict
moves.  This  does  not  mean  that  a  friend’s  personality  and  social  skills  were  unre-
lated to a child’s tendency to argue or prohibit. But the variance in conﬂict explained
by  friend  hyperactivity,  age  and  emotion  understanding  was  shared  with  that
explained by child characteristics.

Clearly,  aspects  of  children’s  lives  and  relationships  other  than  those  considered
here  are  also  likely  to  be  important  in  relation  to  differences  in  their  early  friend-
ships.  Their  relationships  with  parents  and  siblings  are  obvious  candidates.  The
focus  here  on  individual  sociocognitive,  temperamental  and  behavioral  adjustment
characteristics  was  a  ﬁrst  step  in  clarifying  why  and  how  children’s  early  intimate
relationships can be so different. Given the important role we now know that friend-
ships can play in supporting children through transitions and stresses even in early
childhood, and their potential for fostering children’s social development, these dif-
ferences surely deserve further research scrutiny.
