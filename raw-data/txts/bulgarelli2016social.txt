Social cognition is the way in which people process, remember, and use information in
social contexts to explain and predict their own behavior and that of others. Children’s
social cognition may be inﬂuenced by multiple factors, both external and internal to the
child. In the current study, two aspects of social cognition were examined: Theory of
Mind and Emotion Understanding. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects
of type of early care (0–3 years of age), maternal education, parents’ country of
birth, and child’s language on the social cognition of 118 Italian preschoolers. To our
knowledge, the joint effect of these variables on social cognition has not previously
been investigated in the literature. The measures used to collect social cognition and
linguistic data were not parent- or teacher-reports, but based on direct assessment of
the children through two standardized tests, the Test of Emotion Comprehension and
the ToM Storybooks. Relationships among the variables showed a complex pattern.
Overall, maternal education and linguistic competence showed a systematic effect on
social cognition; the linguistic competence mediated the effect of maternal education.
In children who had experienced centre-base care in the ﬁrst 3 years of life, the effect of
maternal education disappeared, supporting the protective role of centre-base care for
children with less educated mothers. The children with native and foreign parents did not
signiﬁcantly differ on the social cognition tasks. Limits of the study, possible educational
outcomes and future research lines were discussed.

Social cognition is the way in which individuals process, remember, and use information in
social contexts to explain and predict how people behave (Fiske and Taylor, 2013). In the current
study, two aspects of social cognition were examined: Theory of Mind (ToM) and Emotion
Understanding (EU). ToM concerns the attribution of mental states (beliefs, desires, intentions,
etc.) to oneself and others, and the ability to use these attributions to understand, predict and
explain one’s own behavior and that of other people (Mitchell, 1997). EU, on the other hand,
is a component of social cognition and emotional competence, which concerns how individuals
understand, predict, and explain their own and others’ emotions (Harris, 1989; Denham, 1998;
Saarni, 1999).

Social Cognition in Preschoolers

From a theoretical point of view, ToM and EU are partly
correlated. In Pons and Harris’ (2000) view, EU is made of
nine components hierarchically organized. The simplest ones
are recognition of emotional expressions and external causes
of emotion, followed by the role of desire, beliefs and external
reminder on emotions, emotion regulation, displayed emotions,
role of moral dimension and mixed emotions. In Wellman’s
(1990) approach, basic ToM in childhood consists of ﬁve
components: recognition of emotion expressions and external
causes of emotion, understanding of desire and beliefs, ability to
distinguish between physical and mental entities, and awareness
of the link between perception and knowledge. Thus, the external
features of emotions are necessary to read and predict people’s
internal states, while beliefs and desires can shape emotions. The
correlation between ToM and EU is also supported by research
outcomes (Hughes and Dunn, 1998; Cutting and Dunn, 1999;
Pears and Fisher, 2005).

The current study focused on some factors, both external and
internal to the child that can inﬂuence social cognition abilities
in a group of Italian pre-schoolers: the role of early type of care
on ToM and EU has been examined together with the eﬀects
of other intervening variables as maternal education, parents’
country of birth, and linguistic competence. In what follows, the
literature showed that the eﬀect of type of care on social cognition
has not been studied yet; that a complex interplay among these
factors could be expected and that a study to take into concern
simultaneously these several variables is necessary. This study
focused ﬁrstly on early type of care and other variables that
are strictly related to it; some other factors that could inﬂuence
children’s social cognition development as socio-economic status
(Shatz et al., 2003; Cutting and Dunn, 1999; Meins et al., 2013),
cognitive functioning and executive functioning (De Stasio et al.,
2014; Schneider et al., 2014) were not deepened.

In early childhood, toddlers receive two main types of care:
centre-based and home-based. In centre-based care, children
experience daily life in a group setting with adults and peers, and
routines, spaces and toys are organized for a group of children
and adults; in addition, the adults providing the care are trained
professionals. In home-based arrangements, children are more
likely to be alone with adults or to share routines and toys
with a very small number of other children, usually younger or
older siblings. In these informal settings, caretakers are usually
mothers, grandparents or non-professional baby-sitters (for a
broader discussion, see Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016).

physical aggression and emotional problems at 4 years of age
were lower in children from low-risk families who had been
in maternal care (Côté et al., 2008). In the US on the other
hand, high quality centre-based care has been found to protect
against internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in
preschoolers from low-income families (Votruba-Drzal et al.,
2004). Thus, besides diﬀerent types of care have shown to aﬀect
cognitive and social dimension of children’s development, as far
as we are aware, to date no studies have examined the relationship
between social cognition at preschool age and the type of care
received during early childhood. Maternal education predicted
centre-based care usage in several countries: Norway (Zachrisson
et al., 2013), Finland and West Germany (Krapf, 2014), Belgium
(Vandenbroeck et al., 2008), UK (Sylva et al., 2007), Italy (Del
Boca et al., 2005) and US (NICHD Early Child Care Research
Network, 1997a, 2006). Moreover, maternal education is the
most robust sociodemographic predictor of mother and infant
behavior (Bornstein et al., 2003; Mistry et al., 2008).

Previous research has shown that children’s social-cognitive
development is positively associated with parental education
level (Perner et al., 1994; Cutting and Dunn, 1999; Pons et al.,
2003). In the UK and US, maternal education is positively
associated with cognitive and linguistic outcomes (NICHD
Early Child Care Research Network, 1997b; NICHD Human
Learning Branch, 1998; Peisner-Feinberg et al., 2001; Sammons
et al., 2004). Similarly, Italian children’s cognitive and linguistic
competence have been found to be systematically related to
maternal education (Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016). Moreover, type
of care has been shown to moderate the maternal education eﬀect
in preschool and school-aged children: speciﬁcally,
linguistic
and cognitive outcomes improve in line with level of maternal
education in children who receive home-based care only,
indicating that centre-based care can play a protective role in the
ﬁrst 3 years of life (Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016). For this reasons,
while deepening the role of early type of care on children’s social
cognition, it is crucial to take into consideration the eﬀect of
maternal education as well.

Some studies reported that migrant status is related to type
of care, speciﬁcally by predicting lower utilization of centre-
based care (Sammons et al., 2004; Turney and Kao, 2009; Miller
et al., 2013, 2014; Zachrisson et al., 2013); though, it is worth
noticing that other studies did not ﬁnd this relationship (Kahn
and Greenberg, 2010; Krapf, 2014). A migrant is deﬁned in the
United Nations Educational Scientiﬁc and Culture Organization
Glossary (2016) as “any person who lives temporarily or
permanently in a country where he or she was not born, and has
acquired some signiﬁcant social ties to this country”; the parents
of ﬁrst-generation children are both migrants. Social cognition is
partly aﬀected by culture (for a review, see Molina et al., 2014),
but migrant status is more than a question of cultural belonging:
it is a condition with speciﬁc features related to entering a
new social context–for example, separation from one’s family
of origin, changes in economic status, negative stereotypes and
discrimination, language barriers and higher levels of stress. Very
often, the migrant condition combines with other variables that
aﬀect children’s development, such as poverty status and dual
language learning, whereby children acquire both their parents’

The literature emphasizes that type of care is associated
with children’s later development, reporting positive eﬀects of
centre-based care on cognitive and linguistic outcomes (Broberg
et al., 1997; NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2002,
2004, 2006; Sylva et al., 2004; Belsky et al., 2007; Loeb et al.,
2007; Magnuson et al., 2007; Hansen and Hawkes, 2009). With
regard to more general social behavior, centre-based care appears
to be related to teacher-reported externalizing problems in
preschool and school age children (NICHD Early Child Care
Research Network, 2002, 2005). A study on Canadian families
showed that maternal care acts as a protective factor in the
ﬁrst year of life as compared to non-maternal care (provided by
relatives, non-relatives, day care centres, etc.): parent-reported

mother tongue and the language of the host country (De Feyter
and Winsler, 2009; Winsler et al., 2014). A Canadian study by
Wade et al. (2014) showed that ToM performance at 5 years
was predicted by children’s language competence, but not by
family income, migrant status or the presence of siblings in the
household. Another study by the same research group (Prime
et al., 2015) showed that mother’s communicative clarity and
mind-reading skills (termed cognitive sensitivity) were positively
related to children’s ToM at 5 years, and receptive language
and academic achievement at preschool age. This pattern of
associations between mothers’ cognitive sensitivity and children’s
outcomes was similar in both native and migrant dyads of
mothers and children, suggesting that the underlying process was
similar. Nevertheless, migrant status appeared to be a risk factor,
because it was negatively associated with maternal cognitive
sensitivity. In keeping with the ﬁndings of Prime et al. (2015),
U.S. immigrant mothers have been shown to report higher levels
of parenting stress than native mothers, with stress predicting
aggressive behavior in pre-school age children (Mistry et al.,
2008).

The theoretical frame outlined so far highlighted that the
relationship between social cognition development and early
type of care requires to focus on other intervening variables,
as maternal education and migrant condition, which in turn
are related to linguistic issues. Moreover, social cognition and
linguistic competence are also “directly” associated with one
another. A meta-analysis by Milligan et al. (2007) reported
that the predictive correlations between language and ToM
were signiﬁcant, even after controlling for age. When linguistic
tasks were administered at an earlier time-point than ToM
tasks, the correlations were higher than under the opposite
condition, suggesting that the inﬂuence of language on ToM
is stronger than the inﬂuence of ToM on language (Milligan
et al., 2007). It may be that an overarching developmental
factor such as working memory (Astington and Jenkins, 1999)
or executive functioning (Carlson and Moses, 2001) inﬂuences
both competences. Multiple aspects of linguistic competence
may be interrelated with ToM: lexicon (for instance, Lohmann
and Tomasello, 2003), syntax (de Villiers and Pyers, 2002) and
conversational experience (Harris, 2005; Deleau, 2012). In the
literature, debate is ongoing concerning the speciﬁc contribution
to ToM of the diﬀerent components of language competence. In
the context of this discussion, Miller (2004) has proposed the
performance hypothesis, which postulates that the inﬂuence of
linguistic competence on performance on ToM tasks is aﬀected
by the linguistic complexity of the ToM task itself; evidence
in support of this hypothesis has also come from a study by
Bulgarelli and Molina (2013). For a wider discussion of these
topics, see Bulgarelli and Molina (2013).

The current study deepens the role of early type of care,
maternal education, parents’ country of birth, and children’s
linguistic competence on social cognition of a group of Italian
pre-schoolers: the reviewed literature showed that a complex
interplay among these factors can be expected thus it is worth
investigating them together in one study. Moreover, as reported
in the Introduction session, previous studies focused on the
eﬀect on social behavior: to our knowledge, our study is the

ﬁrst to analyze the role of type of care on ToM and EU.
Finally, social behavior was usually measured through parent-
or teacher-reported questionnaire (NICHD Early Child Care
Research Network, 2002, 2005; Votruba-Drzal et al., 2004; Côté
et al., 2008). Parents could be considered reliable observers
when they are requested to evaluate children’s behaviors: they
have a privileged perspective on their child’s development and
can observe the child over time and in a familiar environment
(Matheny et al., 1984). Nevertheless, parents are not trained
observers: their judgment may be biased by social desirability,
they may be incapable of perceiving their children’s real
competence (Fenson et al., 1994), and social representation of
childhood may play a role in distorting adults’ observations and
managing the reliability of the measures (for a wider discussion
of this topic, see: Molina and Bulgarelli, 2012b). It is also worth
noticing that children’s social cognition involves internal states
that are not always directly observable: thus, parents may not be
accurate in evaluating this competence (Kårstad et al., 2014). For
these reasons, in the current study social cognition was measured
directly with the children, through standardized tools that are
internationally used to assess ToM and EU.

The current study focused on four research questions, mainly
deduced from the literature. The ﬁrst question related to the
eﬀects of type of early childcare on social cognition: given
that this was the ﬁrst study to investigate such question, we
relied on earlier ﬁndings reported by Bulgarelli and Molina
(2016) concerning cognitive outcomes to formulate the second
hypothesis, predicting that type of care would only yield an
eﬀect in interaction with maternal education: speciﬁcally, higher
maternal education would positively aﬀect children’s social
cognition only in those who had been in home-based care in
the ﬁrst 3 years of life. The second question concerned the
role of maternal education on social cognition and we expected
that maternal education would directly aﬀect children’s social
cognition, in line with the literature reviewed above (Perner et al.,
1994; Cutting and Dunn, 1999; Pons et al., 2003). In keeping
with the existing literature, the third question concerned the
role of parents’ country of birth: no direct eﬀect of this variable
on social cognition is expected (Wade et al., 2014; Prime et al.,
2015). Finally, the fourth question related to the role of child’s
language: in line with earlier studies reported in the literature,
as to the fourth hypothesis linguistic competence was expected
to be directly associated with social cognition and also to be
associated with maternal education (NICHD Early Child Care
Research Network, 1997b; NICHD Human Learning Branch,
1998; Peisner-Feinberg et al., 2001; Sammons et al., 2004; Milligan
et al., 2007; Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016); we therefore set out
to analyze the possible joint eﬀect of maternal education and
linguistic competence on social cognition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Sample
The sample comprised 118 typically developing children (average
age = 59.6 months, SD = 10.4, range: 38.5–76.7 months; average
IQ = 99.6, SD = 13.5), all of them attending kindergartens in

Turin (Italy): see Table 1. Data were collected between 2009 and
2012; most of the children in the current study also took part in
earlier reported research by Bulgarelli and Molina (2016).

Sixty-four children were girls (54.2%). A t-test analysis
conﬁrmed that the two subsamples of boys and girls were similar
with respect to age (p = 0.449), IQ (p = 0.174), type of early
childcare received (p = 0.530), maternal education (p = 0.187),
parents’ country of birth (p = 0.650) and verbal quotient (VQ;
p = 0.450).

With regard to education, 53 mothers had completed lower
secondary school (44.9%), 52 held an upper secondary school
diploma (44.1%) and 13 were university graduates (11.0%).
Overall,
the sample displayed a lower level of educational
achievement than the Italian population between 25 and 64 years
of age in 2011, in which 44% had completed lower secondary
education, 41% upper secondary education, and 15% third level
education (OECD, 2014). For the purposes of the statistical
analysis, the groups of mothers with upper secondary and
university-level education were collapsed into one group termed
the “highly educated group,” after it had been veriﬁed that they
did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer in relation to the independent variables
in the research design. A t-test analysis conﬁrmed that the
two ﬁnal subsamples of children, with less educated and more
highly educated mothers, respectively, were similar in terms of
age (p = 0.644), gender (p = 0.784), type of care (p = 0.116)
and parents’ country of origin (p = 0.163). The IQ and VQ
scores of the children with more highly educated mothers were
signiﬁcantly higher than those of the children whose mothers
had completed a lower level of education (IQ: mLOW = 96.98,
mHIGH = 101.78, tIQ = −1.94, p = 0.055; VQ: mLOW = 76.70,
mHIGH = 84.05, tVQ = −3.18, p = 0.002).
With regard to parent’s country of birth, 92 of the children
had two native-born parents (77.9%); 14 had one foreign-born
parent (11.9%) and 12 two foreign-born parents (10.2%). In
our sample, the percentage of children with two foreign-born
parents was slightly lower than in the Italian population (14.5%)

and the percentage of children from mixed couples was higher
(4.9% in the Italian population; Istat, 2012b). For the purposes
of the statistical analysis, the groups of children with two native-
born parents and one native-born parent were collapsed into
a single subsample labeled native children, after it had been
veriﬁed that these two groups did not diﬀer in relation to the
independent variables in the current research design. A t-test
analysis conﬁrmed that the two ﬁnal subsamples, composed of
children with at least one native-born parent and ﬁrst-generation
children with two foreign-born parents, respectively, were similar
with respect to age (p = 0.433), IQ (p = 0.104), VQ (p = 0.319),
gender (p = 0.627), type of early childcare (p = 0.402) and
maternal education (p = 0.166).

In relation to type of care, in the ﬁrst 3 years of life 54
children had received centre-based care (45.8%) and 64 children
had been in exclusively home-based care. Home-based care had
consisted of either exclusive maternal care or being looked after
by other family members or babysitters. In 2010/11, 14.0% of
Italian children between 0 and 2 years of age were enrolled in
centre-based care, with marked diﬀerences among the diﬀerent
geographical regions: for instance, in the North, 29.4% of children
attended day care in Emilia Romagna and 15.4% in Piemonte,
while in the South, percentages varied from 9.6% in Abruzzo
to 2.4% in Calabria (Istat, 2012a). A t-test analysis conﬁrmed
that the two subsamples of children who had received home-
based care and centre-based care were similar with respect to
age (p = 0.852), IQ (p = 0.276), VQ (p = 0.136), gender
(p = 0.530) and parents’ country of birth (p = 0.215), but diﬀered
signiﬁcantly in relation to maternal education: highly educated
mothers were more likely to choose centre-based care (p= 0.021).
Measures and Procedures
At three separate sessions conducted within a month of each
other, the children were individually assessed at kindergarten
using four standardized tests: the ToM Storybooks (Molina and
Bulgarelli, 2012a; Bulgarelli et al., 2015) were used to assess ToM
and the Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC, Pons and Harris,
2000; Albanese and Molina, 2013) to assess EU; the Leiter-R
(Roid and Miller, 2002; US version: 1997) was used to assess
non-verbal IQ; the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn and
Dunn, 1981), in its Italian version (Stella et al., 2000) was used to
assess receptive language, reported as Verbal Quotient (VQ).

The ToM Storybooks is a comprehensive 93-item instrument
tapping the ﬁve components in Wellman’s (1990) model of
ToM: emotion recognition, understanding of desire and beliefs,
ability to distinguish between physical and mental entities, and
awareness of the link between perception and knowledge; a
classical False Belief task is also included. The total score varied
from 0 to 111; in this study the total score was used because the
standardization of the test is still ongoing. The ToM Storybooks
is made up of six full-picture books telling stories about a boy
called Sam. Each book recounts an adventure of Sam’s (Sam
going to the swimming pool, visiting his grandparents, etc.) and
contains 5 or 6 tasks assessing one or more ToM components.
The experimenter reads the story while the child looks at the
images. In one of the tasks that tap the role of desire in generating
behaviors, Sam is searching for his dog: “Where is Puckie? Puckie

has hidden [point the picture] behind the tree or [point the
picture] behind the trash can. Sam wants to play with Puckie.
First, he goes to look behind the trash can. But Puckie is not there.
What will Sam do now?”

The TEC evaluates nine hierarchically organized components
of EU that emerge between 3 and 11 years. The simplest
ones are recognition of emotional expressions and external
causes of emotion, followed by the role of desire, beliefs and
external reminder on emotions, emotion regulation, displayed
emotions, role of moral dimension and mixed emotions. The
TEC raw score varied from 0 to 9 and in this study the
Italian standardized z-score was used. Each TEC components
are proposed in the frame of a short pictured story;
the
child answers to the task questions by indicating the facial
expression of the correct emotion, accordingly to what happened.
For example,
in which the
diﬀerence between apparent and real emotion is tapped, the
experimenter reads this story: “This is Sarah and this is
Dorothy. Dorothy is teasing Sarah because Dorothy has lots of
marbles and Sarah doesn’t have any. Sarah is smiling because
she doesn’t want to show Dorothy how she is feeling inside.
How is Sarah feeling inside? Is she happy, alright, angry or
scared?”

in the displayed emotion task,

Parents were asked to complete a questionnaire on their socio-
demographic background, which assessed both parent-related
characteristics (country of birth, level of education) and child-
related characteristics (country of birth, gender, siblings, type
of childcare during the ﬁrst 3 years of life). Thus, the data
concerning the type of early care received in the ﬁrst 3 years of
life was collected retrospectively.

Mothers’ level of education was coded in terms of the Italian
school system: (0) lower level of education (i.e., mothers had
obtained a low school degree, corresponding to a maximum of
8 years’ school); (1) more highly educated (i.e., mothers had
attended at least 13 years of school/university, with high school,
bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees all collapsed together
into a single category).

For each child, parents’ country of birth was coded as follows:
(0) native children (i.e., two native-born parents or one native-
born and one foreign-born parent); (1) ﬁrst-generation children
(i.e., two foreign-born parents).

Analysis
T-tests for small sample sizes were performed to check for
signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the children’s ToM and EU scores
as an eﬀect of type of early childcare, parents’ country of
birth and maternal education. The direct eﬀect of language
on social cognition was assessed by analyzing the correlations
between linguistic competence scores and ToM and EU scores,
respectively.

To test for interactions between maternal education and type
of early childcare or parents’ country of birth, separate t-tests for
the eﬀect of maternal education on ToM and EU were performed
on the type of care and parental country of origin subsamples. An
ANOVA analysis has not been run: the sample size was too small
to test the interaction eﬀects through an ANOVA; for this reason,
a regression analysis was not run as well.

The mediating eﬀect of linguistic competence was investigated
by conducting two regression analyses, with ToM and EU scores
as dependent variables and maternal education and parents’
country of birth as independent variables.

RESULTS

Direct Effect of Individual Variables
Type of early childcare did not lead to signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
ToM and EU and the eﬀect size was not relevant as well (Table 2).
Maternal education was found to have a signiﬁcant direct eﬀect
on ToM and EU scores. First-generation children obtained the
lowest mean scores on the social cognition measures: although
these scores did not signiﬁcantly diﬀer from those of the other
children, the eﬀect size was relevant (Table 2). Finally, linguistic
competence was found to be correlated with both ToM and EU
scores (r = 0.503, p < 0.01 and r = 0.406, p < 0.01, respectively).
Interaction among Variables: The Role of
Type of Care
Type of care and maternal education were found to interact, in
that maternal education had an eﬀect on the social cognition
abilities of children who had received home-based care only, but
not on those of children who had been in centre-based care.
More speciﬁcally, children whose mothers had completed a lower
level of education only obtained signiﬁcantly lower ToM scores
than children with more highly educated mothers when they had
received exclusively home-based care in the ﬁrst 3 years of life
(Table 3).

Interaction among Variables: The Role of
Parent’s Country of Birth
Parental country of birth and maternal education were found to
interact: namely, maternal education had an eﬀect on the social
cognition abilities of children with native-born parents, but not
on those of ﬁrst-generation children. More speciﬁcally, children
whose mothers had completed a lower level of education only
obtained signiﬁcantly lower ToM and EU scores than children
with more highly educated mothers when both parents were
native-born (Table 4). Nevertheless, considering the eﬀect size,
the diﬀerences due to parents’ country of birth were lower than
the diﬀerences observed in respect to the maternal education.

Interaction among Variables: The Role of
Linguistic Competence
With regard to the role of linguistic competence, both a direct
eﬀect of language on ToM and EU scores and a mediation eﬀect
of language on the relationship between maternal education and
ToM and EU were found.

(p < 0.01), and this correlation was reduced if the language eﬀect
was considered (Beta = 0.137, NS).

Turning to EU,

the same pattern of results was found
(Figure 1): the partial correlation between linguistic competence
and EU scores (while controlling for the eﬀect of maternal
education) was 0.380 (p < 0.01), the direct correlation between
maternal education and EU scores was 0.235 (p < 0.05), and this
correlation was reduced if the linguistic competence eﬀect was
considered (Beta = 0.127, NS).

When these correlations were analyzed separately in the two
groups of children who had received home-based only versus
centre-based care, the pattern of results diﬀered (Figure 1).
With respect to children in home-based care, two signiﬁcant
direct correlations were found: between maternal education
and linguistic competence (r = 0.422, p < 0.01) and between
maternal education and ToM scores (r = 0.347, p < 0.01);
furthermore,
linguistic competence and ToM scores were
correlated, partializing for maternal education (Beta = 0.529,
p < 0.01). Moreover,
linguistic competence mediated the

relationship between maternal education and ToM:
in fact,
the direct correlation between maternal education and ToM
was reduced if the linguistic competence eﬀect was considered
(Beta = 0.124, NS). With respect to children in centre-based care,
the correlation between linguistic competence and ToM was the
only signiﬁcant relationship identiﬁed (Beta = 0.379, p < 0.01),
with no correlations found between maternal education and ToM
or between maternal education and language.

A similar pattern of results was found for EU (Figure 1): in
the subsample of children who had received home-based care
only, there were direct correlation between maternal education
and linguistic competence (r = 0.422, p < 0.01), and between
maternal education and EU scores (r = 0.271, p < 0.05); linguistic
competence correlated with EU (Beta = 0.500, p < 0.01),
and mediated the relationship between maternal education and
EU: more speciﬁcally, the direct correlation between maternal
education and ToM was reduced if the linguistic competence
eﬀect was taken into account (Beta = 0.061, NS). On the contrary,
in children in centre-based care the only signiﬁcant relationship

identiﬁed was the correlation between linguistic competence and
EU (Beta = 0.245, p < 0.01).

When parents’ country of birth was included in the analysis,
only linguistic competence was strongly correlated with ToM and
EU, in both migrant parent and native-born parent subgroups
(Table 5). However, no mediation eﬀect was found: parents’
country of birth was not correlated with language (r = 0.113, NS
for the total sample; r = 0.055, NS for children in home-based
care; and r = 0.154, NS for children in centre-based care), nor
with ToM (r = 0.101, NS for the total sample; r = 0.061, NS
for children in home-based care; and r = 0.154, NS for children
in centre-based care), nor with EU (r = 0.125, NS, for the total
sample; r = 0.071, NS for children in home-based care; and
r = 0.106, NS for children in centre-based care).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The aim of this study was to contribute to the debate about the
eﬀects of type of early childcare, maternal education, parents’

country of birth, and child’s linguistic competence on children’s
social cognition as observed at preschool age by analyzing Italian
data. We analyzed two speciﬁc social cognition abilities, ToM and
EU, ﬁnding them to display a systematically similar pattern of
relationships with the independent variables under study.

Interestingly, in our study type of early childcare did not have
a direct eﬀect on social cognition and, as predicted according
to the ﬁrst hypothesis, interacted with maternal education: the
ToM and EU scores of children who received their early childcare
in the home were aﬀected by maternal education, whereas this
was not the case for children in centre-based care. It seemed
that centre-based care could play a protective role for children
with lower-educated mothers: on one hand, professionals provide
stimulating contexts and aware educational practice (for a wider
discussion, see: Molina, 2016; Molina et al., 2016); on the
other hand,
in day care services children experience stable
and numerous relationship with peers that could foster ToM
development: debate is still open about a positive eﬀect of the
presence of siblings in the family and peers in kindergarten,
observed in some studies (McAlister and Peterson, 2007; Wang

and Su, 2009) but not in others (Das and Babu, 2004; Molina and
Bulgarelli, 2012a).

According to the second hypothesis, maternal education was
found to have a direct eﬀect on ToM and EU: evidence of
the eﬀect of maternal education on social cognition has been
found in other studies (Perner et al., 1994; Cutting and Dunn,
1999; Pons et al., 2003) as well as in our own earlier study on
cognitive outcomes (Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016). A possible
explanation for the positive eﬀect of maternal education on
children’s development could lay on mothers’ higher awareness
of the importance of the quantity and quality of time spent
with the oﬀspring: higher-educated parents spend more time
with their children than lower-educated parents; they are more
aware of the link between spending time with their children
and their future development; and are more likely to interiorise
and implement the social norms and behaviors associated with
“involved parenting” (Sayer et al., 2004; Craig, 2006; Monna and
Gauthier, 2008). Moreover, the development of social cognition
is speciﬁcally supported by parents’ ability to mentalise: mind-
mindedness is deﬁned as the adults’ tendency to comment
appropriately on their children’s internal states and it plays a
protective role for the children’s social development, speciﬁcally
in low socioecomomic families (Meins et al., 2002, 2013).

In line with the Canadian study by Wade et al. (2014) and
the previous Italian study on cognitive outcomes (Bulgarelli and
Molina, 2016), an eﬀect of parents’ country of birth on children’s
social cognition was not expected. Nevertheless, the results were
partly diﬀerent: no signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found between
children with native and foreign parents, but the eﬀect size of
the diﬀerence between the two groups was not negligible (0.45
and 0.42 for ToM and EU scores, respectively). Then, the lack
of signiﬁcance of the diﬀerence could be due to the insuﬃcient
power of the statistical test, taking into consideration that the
sample was highly unbalanced in favor of children with native
parents. Similarly, the very small number of ﬁrst-generation
children could explain the lack of diﬀerences due to maternal
education observed in this subsample.

As expected based on the literature (for instance, Milligan
et al., 2007), the fourth hypothesis was conﬁrmed: linguistic
competence directly aﬀected social cognition. On analyzing the

role of children’s linguistic competence, which is related to both
children’s social cognition and maternal education, linguistic
competence was shown to mediate the maternal education eﬀect
on social cognition, but only in children in home-based care.
As stated before, professional care appeared to play a protective
role for children with less educated mothers. The protective
role of early type of care was less clear when considering the
two groups of children with native and foreign parents:
in
this case, the linguistic competence seemed the relevant aspect
to diﬀerentiate children’s performances in the social cognition
tasks. In sum, when not correlated with maternal education,
language was the variable that mainly correlated with the ToM
and EU scores. More highly educated mothers had children
with greater linguistic competence, but centre-based care in
the early years compensated for this diﬀerence. As previously
discussed elsewhere (Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016), designing
educational intervention and training professionals to better
support children’s linguistic development from the early years of
life seem crucial: day care services are the context where such
support could be better provided (Scopesi and Viterbori, 2008;
Molina et al., 2016) and such intervention could be crucial for
children with two foreign-born parents.

The role if linguistic competence in shaping the diﬀerences
among children’s social cognition performances should be
interpreted with caution, because children’s performance on the
ToM and EU tasks were also aﬀected by the linguistic format
of the task itself (Miller, 2004). Moreover, this study focused on
receptive language: this measure was chosen because it is a good
index of children’s general linguistic competence yet easy and
fast to assess; nevertheless, language is a complex construct and
future research could deepen the role of other linguistic aspects,
as syntax and conversational ability.

With regard to the limits of the current study, the quasi-
experimental design required to interpret
the results with
caution. The sample was recruited in a speciﬁc Italian region:
this guaranteed a higher homogeneity of social inﬂuence on
our sample, but limited the generalizability of the results to
the Italian population. Italian children’s ToM and EU showed
speciﬁc pattern of development compared to British and German
children (Lecce and Hughes, 2010; Molina et al., 2014): thus
the generalizability of the pattern of the current results to other
western countries should be speciﬁcally tested. Furthermore, the
sample included a relatively low number of children with two
foreign-born parents, that did not allow to perform a multiple
regression analysis to test the interaction of the independent
variables; nevertheless, the percentage of this group of subjects
was in line with the percentage of children with two foreign
parents living in Italy in the period when the data were collected.
It is worth noticing that the sample was balanced between
medium-low and medium-high socio-economic status, avoiding
the biases due to the diﬃculty in enrolling low socio-economic
families. The pattern of the eﬀect of type of early childcare,
maternal education, and parents’ country of birth on social
cognition was similar to that observed in a previous study in
which verbal and cognitive competence were the dependent
variables (Bulgarelli and Molina, 2016) and this could be read
as a partial support to the validity of the current research.

Nevertheless, this pattern of eﬀects might be limited to preschool
age, and further investigation with older children is needed. In
future research, it would be of interest to explore the role of
cognitive functioning and gender in greater depth, together with
an index of quality of the type of care in early infancy.

To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst study to have investigated
together the role of early childcare, maternal education, parent’s
country of origin and children’s receptive language in the
development of social cognition. Type of care, in interaction with
maternal education and children’s linguistic competence, aﬀected
social cognition and early centre-based care seemed to play a
protective role for those children with lower-educated mothers.
The protective role of centre-based care was less clear when
considering the eﬀect of parental country of birth and further
research is needed.
