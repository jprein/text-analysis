 PETTIT, GREGORY S.; DODGE, KENNETH A.; and BROWN, MELISSA M. Early Family Experience,
 Social Problem Solving Patterns, and Children's Social Competence. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1988,
 59, 107-120. The relations among early social and familial experience, social problem solving skill,
 and social competence in the classroom were examined in a sample of 46 preschool (4- and 5-year-
 old) children from economically distressed backgrounds. The hypothesis was tested that (a) early
 family experiences would be related to classroom social competence, and (b) that this relation would
 be mediated by the child's social problem solving patterns. Early experience was assessed during a
 semistructured home-visit interview with each child's mother. Measures derived from this interview
 included the child's level of exposure to deviant aggressive models, maternal values and expecta-
 tions for the child, harshness of discipline toward the child, use of preventive teaching with the
 child, and the child's degree of early experience with peers. The child's classroom competence was
 assessed by sociometric nominations and teacher ratings of aggressiveness and social skill. Re-
 sponses to hypothetical social problems were used to generate measures of the child's social prob-
 lem solving patterns. Several dimensions of family experience were found to be predictive of both
 classroom social competence and social problem solving. Stepwise regression analyses revealed that
 some kinds of early experience (e.g., early experience with peers) appeared to have a direct impact
 on peer outcomes, whereas for other experiences (e.g., exposure to deviant maternal values and
 expectations), the relation to social competence with peers was mediated by the child's social
 problem solving skills and patterns. The need to consider family relationship factors when design-
 ing preventive intervention programs for socially incompetent children was stressed.

 Over the past several years, researchers

 increasingly have sought to describe the pro-
 cesses by which children become socially
 competent. Interest in social competence,
 particularly during the early elementary
 school years, has been fueled by accumulat-
 ing data indicating that children who are so-
 cially rejected at this age are at heightened
 risk for maladaptive outcomes in adolescence
 and early adulthood (Kupersmidt, Coie,
 Dodge, & Rabiner, in press). Study of the ori-
 gins of social competence has progressed
 along two parallel paths. One path has been
 followed by researchers who have focused on

 the quality of family relationships and early
 experiences, and the other by those who have
 focused on the social problem solving skills
 and information-processing patterns; until re-
 cently, these two paths have not crossed. The
 goal of the present research was to test the
 hypothesis that early family experiences in-
 fluence the quality of peer relations by in-
 fluencing a child's pattern of processing social
 information.

 Current research and theory indicate that
 children learn many of their social behavioral
 patterns in their family of origin (see Maccoby

 & Martin, 1983), suggesting that early family
 experience may play a key role in the devel-
 opment of social skills and status among peers
 in the school setting. Although few investiga-
 tors have directly examined the link between
 family experience and children's social status,
 the relation between the quality of parenting
 and more general forms of childhood social
 competence has been considered in several
 studies. For example, it has been shown that
 children who establish secure attachment re-
 lationships during infancy are more likely to
 be competent with peers (typically defined in
 terms of teacher ratings of social skill) than
 insecurely attached infants at ages 2-5 years
 (Arend, Gove, & Sroufe, 1979; Easterbrooks
 & Lamb, 1979; Lieberman, 1977; Main &
 Weston, 1981; Pastor, 1981; Waters, Wipp-
 man, & Sroufe, 1979). These studies have
 been important in demonstrating the continu-
 ity of human adaptation in the early yeats, but
 the molar construct of attachment does not in-
 form us about the processes by which chil-
 dren acquire socially skilled behaviors.

 Other research has focused on the rela-

 tion between specific parenting practices and
 children's social competence. In general, this
 work has shown that hostile, inconsistent par-
 enting predicts the development of socially
 incompetent (e.g., aggressive) behavior in
 children (Baldwin, 1955; Baumrind, 1967;
 Eron, 1982; George & Main, 1979; Winder &
 Rau, 1962). Conversely, socially competent
 behavior with peers (e.g., affiliative, co-
 operative behavior) is predicted by warm, re-
 sponsive parenting (Baumrind, 1967, 1971;
 Bryant & Crockenberg, 1980). Proactive
 methods, especially parental teaching and
 "dialoguing," have also been linked to chil-
 dren's development of competence (Pettit &
 Bates, 1987; Spivack, Platt, & Shure, 1976).

 Two recent studies have focused explic-
 itly on attributes of the parent-child relation-
 ship that may be related to children's social
 behavior and acceptance in the peer group.
 MacDonald and Parke (1984) observed moth-
 ers and fathers interacting with their pre-
 school-aged child and then correlated ob-
 served attributes of this interaction with the
 child's adaptation among peers, as noted by
 teachers. Competent boys had fathers who
 were physically playful, eliciting positive af-
 fect during play, and mothers who were ver-
 bally stimulating. Competent girls had fathers
 (but not mothers) who were verbally stimulat-
 ing. MacDonald and Parke speculated that af-
 fect-arousing encounters such as physical
 play may assist children in the acquisition of
 friendship-making skills by providing the

 children with practice in encoding and re-
 sponding to others' affective signals.

 Putallaz (1987) also examined the rela-
 tion between parenting variables and chil-
 dren's social behavior. A number of maternal
 behaviors assessed in a standard laboratory
 parent-child interaction were found to be sig-
 nificantly correlated with first-grade chil-
 dren's sociometric status and social behavior
 with peers. Mothers who used positive verbal
 statements (e.g., polite requests and sugges-
 tions) and were less disagreeable and de-
 manding had children who were more so-
 cially accepted as well as more positive and
 less abrasive in observed interactions with
 peers. Putallaz also examined the relation be-
 tween maternal behavior and children's social
 knowledge (i.e., problem solving skills) and
 the relation between children's social knowl-
 edge and their social status. The quality of a
 child's solutions to hypothetical social prob-
 lems was found to be predictable from mater-
 nal behavior, and a child's social problem sol-
 ving skills in turn predicted that child's social
 status. These findings are consistent with the
 hypothesis that parent-child interaction af-
 fects peer competence by leading to incre-
 ments in social cognitive skills that are the
 basis of competent peer-directed behavior.

 There are many other ways that early
 family experiences may have an impact on a
 child's social competence. For instance, par-
 ents may or may not provide their children
 with early opportunities for peer experience
 (see Parke, MacDonald, Beitel, & Bhavnagri,
 in press), and this has been shown to have
 consequences for the child's social compe-
 tence in later peer settings (Harper & Huie,
 1985; Ladd & Price, 1986; Lieberman, 1977;
 Roopnarine, 1985). At still another level, par-
 ents may influence their child's level of social
 competence by minimizing the child's expo-
 sure to violence and social trauma (see re-
 views by Hetherington & Martin, 1979; and
 Rutter, 1981). Parents who have negative or
 developmentally inappropriate expectations
 for the child's behavior may also contribute to
 their child's development of social compe-
 tence (Dix & Grusec, 1985). It is reasonable to
 hypothesize, then, that restrictive discipline,
 the absence of proactive teaching, lack of
 early peer experience, the experience of so-
 cial trauma, and exposure to deviant social ex-
 pectations could predict later social rejection
 from peers.

 The research described above suggests

 that early social experiences may play an im-
 portant role in children's development of so-

 tions between early family experience mea-
 sures and measures of classroom peer rela-
 tions would become nonsignificant when
 measures of social information processing pat-
 terns are controlled through partial correla-
 tional (or hierarchical regression) procedures.
 The alternate hypothesis, that early family ex-
 periences influence peer outcomes in ways
 that are not mediated by processing patterns,
 was also tested.

 cial interactive competence. However, the ac-
 tual mechanism by which family experience
 and peer competence become linked-that is,
 how early social experience is transformed
 into social behavior that the child may display
 in extrafamilial contexts-remains unclear.
 The writings of Putallaz (1987) and MacDon-
 ald and Parke (1984) suggest that social prob-
 lem-solving patterns may mediate the impact
 of early social experience on future social be-
 havior, and recent research in attachment
 (e.g., Main, Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985) has like-
 wise suggested that social cognitive represen-
 tations of early experience may serve impor-
 tant functions in the acquisition of social
 competence. This possibility, however, has
 not yet received direct empirical study.

 Several recent studies by researchers fol-
 lowing the second path described earlier
 (e.g., Dodge, 1986; Rubin & Krasnor, 1986)
 have clearly shown that social cognitive pat-
 terns, especially attributional biases, aggres-
 sive response tendencies, and problem solv-
 ing skill deficits, correlate with and antecede
 behavior patterns that lead to peer rejection.
 Relatively few investigators have examined
 directly the social origins of these social cog-
 nitive patterns, but the results of those studies
 suggest that the same early experiences that
 act on social behavioral development also act
 on the development of social cognitive skills
 (Bryant & Crockenberg, 1980; Costanzo &
 Dix, 1983; Elias, Ubriaco, & Gray, 1985;
 Jones, Rickel, & Smith, 1980; Smetana, Kelly,
 & Twentyman, 1984; Spivack et al., 1976).
 These early experiences include social
 trauma, exposure to incompetent parenting,
 being raised in an environment that endorses
 socially inappropriate values, and limited op-
 portunities to interact with peers.

 In the present study, we examined the
 origins of children's social problem solving
 patterns and social competence, as well as the
 mechanisms by which children achieve that
 competence. On the basis of the literature re-
 viewed earlier, specific features of the early
 social and family environment were hypothe-
 sized to have an impact on the development
 of social problem solving patterns and social
 behavior of children at age 5. It was hypothe-
 sized that children's social acceptance and so-
 ciometric status would be predictable from
 early family experience and social informa-
 tion processing patterns. It was further hy-
 pothesized that the relation between early
 family experiences and classroom peer rela-
 tions would be mediated by the child's pat-
 tern of processing social information. That is,
 it was predicted that any significant correla-

 Method

 SAMPLE

 Subjects were drawn from the four class-
 rooms of a federally sponsored preschool for
 economically disadvantaged children that
 serves a total of 63 4- and 5-year-olds and is
 located in a medium-sized Midwestern com-
 munity. Every child was given an announce-
 ment describing the general purposes of the
 study and containing an informed consent
 form to take home; consent to participate was
 obtained in 87% of cases (55 of 63, comprising
 28 boys and 27 girls). All but two children
 were Caucasian; all families were from lower
 socioeconomic backgrounds, and in 80% the
 mother was the single parent. Full data were
 subsequently obtained for 46 children (25
 boys and 21 girls).

 PROCEDURES AND MEASURES

 Classroom Competence Measures

 Four summary measures-social prefer-
 ence, social status, classroom social skill, and
 classroom aggression-were derived from rat-
 ings provided by peers and teachers.

 Peer ratings.-In individual interviews
 conducted by undergraduate research assis-
 tants, the children were shown photographs
 of each classmate and asked in sequence (a)
 to indicate on a five-point rating scale, "How
 much do you like to play with - ?" (picto-
 rial aids were used to assist in the rating pro-
 cedure; see Asher, Singleton, Tinsley, & Hy-
 mel, 1979); (b) to select from the full set of
 photographs the three classmates the child
 liked least, and liked most; (c) to name three
 classmates who "cooperate, take turns, and
 are nice to play with"; and (d) to name three
 who "start fights, say mean things, and don't
 share." After being asked what games they
 like to play (to divert attention from the evalu-
 ative aspect of the interview), the children
 were returned to their classroom.

 Teacher ratings.-Each classroom

 teacher and teacher aide completed the 24-
 item teacher checklist for each study child. As

 reported in Dodge (1986), this checklist
 yields a composite score for the child's ag-
 gressiveness (five items, alpha = .95) and so-
 cial skill (seven items, alpha = .98) with
 peers. Teacher and teacher aide scores
 (which correlated r = .67 and .55, respec-
 tively, on the two composites) were subse-
 quently combined.

 The social preference measure was de-
 rived from classmates' ratings of how much
 they liked to play with the child. First, peer-
 nomination scores for liked most and liked
 least were standardized within classrooms;
 social preference was then indexed by sub-
 tracting the liked-least score from the liked-
 most score and restandardizing the differ-
 ence. Social status groups were formed from
 the peer ratings using the criteria described
 by Coie, Dodge, and Coppotelli (1982). Using
 standardized scores, children with social pref-
 erence scores > 1.0, liked-most scores > 0,
 and liked-least scores < 0 were assigned to
 the "popular" group (N = 8). Children in the
 "rejected" group (N = 9) had social prefer-
 ence scores < -1.0, liked-most scores < 0,
 and liked-least scores > 0. The social status of
 the third group (N = 34) was either average
 (i.e., social preference scores between -.5
 and .5) or unclassifiable.1 Classroom social
 skill was derived by combining teachers'
 scores on the composite social skills variable
 with frequency of selection by classmates as
 being "cooperative"; the correlation between
 these two indexes was .37 (p < .05).2 The
 classroom aggression measure was derived
 by combining aggression composite scores as-
 signed by teachers with the index derived
 from peer nominations (r = .47 between the
 two indexes).
 Social Problem Solving

 Individual interviews aimed at assessing
 social problem solving skills and deficits were
 conducted with 49 of the study children by
 undergraduate research assistants blind to
 scores obtained by the children in other
 phases of the study. Nine variables (propen-
 sity to respond aggressively to hypothetical
 provocations and eight indexes of qualities of
 social problem solving skills) were derived
 from this material and subsequently reduced
 to a total of five summary measures.

 1. The child was shown eight videotaped

 vignettes of two 8-10-year-old boys in which
 one of the actors clearly provoked the other
 while engaged in play (from Dodge, Murphy,
 & Buchsbaum, 1984). The children were
 asked what they would do if they were the
 one being provoked; their responses were
 coded as "forget it" (1), "ask why" (2), "tell
 the teacher" (3), or "get mad" (4) by two inde-
 pendent coders with an average agreement of
 98%.

 2. Four stories describing ambiguous
 provocations of a character of the same sex as
 the child were read to the subject (from
 Dodge, 1980). The child was then asked how
 she or he would react to the provocation. The
 aggressiveness of the child's response (i.e.,
 the willingness of the child to express anger
 or hostility) was scored on the same four-point
 scale as described above by two independent
 coders with an average of 95% agreement. A
 summary measure of aggressiveness in hypo-
 thetical provocation was defined by the mean
 aggressiveness rating obtained across this and
 the previous procedure (alpha for the 12
 items-i.e., eight vignettes and four stories-
 was .73).

 3. Each child was given Rubin's Social
 Problem Solving Test (1983) in which four
 stories describing object-acquisition issues
 (e.g., getting a balloon from another child) and
 three centered on friendship initiation (e.g.,
 making friends with a new child in class) are
 read to the child, who is also shown pictures
 depicting the given situation (with sex of story
 character matched to that of the subject). The
 child was asked how she or he would resolve
 the social problem; after noting the response,
 the interviewer probed for additional possible
 solutions ("If that didn't work, what else
 could you say or do in order to ...") until no
 further response could be obtained. Four
 measures were derived from each of the two
 types of stories: (1) total number of solutions
 (mean interrater proportional agreement =
 .99; alpha = .88 and .85 for object acquisition
 and friendship initiation, respectively); (2) to-
 tal number of different solutions judged to be
 relevant for solving the problem (interrater
 agreement = .80; alphas = .85 and .85, re-
 spectively); (3) proportion of solutions that

 1 The average (N = 18) and unclassifiable (N = 16) groups were combined because previous
 research (Coie & Dodge, 1983) had shown them to be quite similar and because no differences were
 found between these groups in the present research. Three "neglected" children and one "contro-
 versial" child were also identified using the Coie et al. (1982) criteria; these children were excluded
 from status-group comparisons.

 2 All composited measures described here and elsewhere in the article were standardized prior

 to being summed.

 ment = .89; alphas = .86 and .83); and (4)
 proportion of solutions that were prosocial
 (interrater agreement = .89; alphas = .82 and
 .69). The correlations across the two types-of-
 problem stories in the total number of solu-
 tions offered by the child, their relevancy,
 and the proportion that were aggressive were
 r = .84, .65, and .59, respectively (p < .001 in
 all instances); scores on these three variables
 were consequently combined across story
 type into summary measures. Proportion of
 prosocial solutions was not consistent across
 stories (r = .19, N.S.); because prosocial solu-
 tions to friendship initiation problems were
 considered to be the more indicative of com-
 petent reasoning, this measure was retained
 and the object-acquisition prosocial response
 variable was dropped from further analyses.
 Family and Social Experiences

 A trained clinical interviewer (with a
 doctorate in clinical psychology or child de-
 velopment, or advanced clinical graduate
 training) who was unaware of the child's sta-
 tus on any of the previously described mea-
 sures visited 46 of the study mothers in their
 homes for approximately 90 min. The child
 was present during at least part of the inter-
 view, which proceeded in four stages and was
 recorded on audio-records. The 11 indexes
 derived from the full interview were subse-
 quently conceptually reduced to six summary
 measures (defined at the end of this section).

 1. Mothers were asked a standard set of

 questions about the child's experiences in in-
 fancy (0-12 months), toddlerhood (1-4 years),
 and the past 12 months; probes for details
 were used as necessary. For each develop-
 mental period, codings were made for (a)
 presence (1) versus absence (0) of any evi-
 dence or suspicion of physical abuse (defined
 as inflicting some physical harm); (b) expo-
 sure to some form of family violence, typically
 spouse abuse (coded as yes = 1, no = 0), and
 (c) use of physical punishment, coded as
 "never" (0), "occasionally" (1), or "fre-
 quently" (3). Codes assigned over the three
 periods were summed for a score on each var-
 iable.

 The quality and quantity of early peer en-
 counters described by the mother as experi-
 enced by her child in toddlerhood and the
 past 12 months were rated on four-point
 scales and summed over the two periods; the
 correlation between the resultant scores was
 substantial (r = .62), and they were conse-
 quently combined into a single measure of
 quantity and quality of prior peer experience.

 Pettit, Dodge, and Brown 111

 Interrater agreement on these four in-
 dexes (established by independent coding of
 audio-records of all interviews) averaged .94
 for abuse, .78 for exposure to violence, .78 for
 discipline, and .66 for prior peer experience.
 2. The mother was read five vignettes in

 which a child misbehaves in situations cen-
 tering on responding to failure, ambiguous
 provocation, failure at peer-group entry, social
 normative expectations, and superiority
 (these social situations have been found to be
 important to peer relations in the early school
 years by Dodge, McClaskey, & Feldman,
 1985). Following Costanzo and Fraenkel's
 (personal communication) hypotheses con-
 cerning the socialization importance of moth-
 ers' degree of concern about misbehavior and
 degree of constraint in response to the misbe-
 havior, mothers were asked to indicate on
 nine-point scales their responses to the fol-
 lowing four sets of questions: (a) "How would
 you feel if your child acted this way?" and
 "How much would it worry you?"; responses
 were both consistent across the five stories
 (alphas = .60 and .82) and significantly cor-
 related (r = .37), and were summed into a
 single "degree-of-concern" composite. (b) Re-
 sponses to "How much discipline would you
 use?" and "How much would you punish
 your child?" were similarly consistent across
 stories (alphas = .62 and .65) and intercor-
 related (r = .67), and were summed into a
 single "degree-of-constraint" composite. (c)
 Responses to "How much would you reason
 with your child?" (alpha = .56) were used to
 index mothers' "use of reasoning." Finally,
 (d) responses to "How would you prevent
 this situation from occurring in the first
 place?" were rated on a four-point scale in-
 dexing the extent of proactive (or preventive,
 nonreactive) teaching. Ratings were reliable
 (interrater agreement = .77) and internally
 consistent (alpha = .76) and were summed
 across stories into a single "proactive teach-
 ing" score.

 3. Four stories describing an ambiguous

 provocation directed toward the mother by
 her child were read to the mother; her inter-
 pretation of the event was scored as hostile (1)
 or benign (0). Responses were internally con-
 sistent across three of the four stories (alpha
 = .66); responses from these three stories
 were summed to yield a measure of"mother's
 biases regarding the child's behavior."

 4. A 16-item questionnaire was adminis-
 tered to the mother orally; she responded on
 seven-point Likert-type scales with the assis-
 tance of pictorial aids. The scale was devel-

 dorsement of aggression as a solution to inter-
 personal problems (obtained alpha = .58) and
 a three-item index of extent to which the child
 had been exposed to aggressive models (al-
 pha = .51; the remaining five items were
 omitted).

 Relying on conceptual guidelines, the in-
 terview indexes were grouped into the fol-
 lowing six measures: exposure to deviant, ag-
 gressive models (four items, alpha = .68)--
 incidence of physical abuse, exposure to vio-
 lence, and physical punishment (see [1]
 above) and the questionnaire index of expo-
 sure to aggressive models (see [4]); restrictive
 discipline style (three items, alpha = .84)--
 degree of concern, degree of constraint, and
 use of reasoning (see [2]); preventive teach-
 ing (one item, see [2] above); mother's biased
 expectations (one item, see [3] above); moth-
 er's endorsement of aggression (one item, see
 [4] above); and direct peer experience (one
 item, see [1] above).

 because the sheer number of generated re-
 sponses increased their chances of hitting a
 useful strategy. Children generating relevant
 responses were also somewhat likely to gen-
 erate prosocial responses (r = .43, p < .001).
 Early Family Experience Measures

 As can be seen in Table 1, several inter-
 correlations among the measures derived
 from the home-visit interview were signifi-
 cant. The exposure-to-aggression measure
 was modestly related to the endorsement-of-
 aggression measure (r = .34, p < .01) and
 direct peer experience (r = -.26, p < .05).
 The endorsement of aggression was also re-
 lated to mother-reported restrictive discipline
 (r = .35, p < .01) and direct peer experience
 (r = -.25, p < .05). The strongest correlation
 in this set was between mothers' endorse-
 ment of aggression and mothers' use of pre-
 ventive teaching in response to the hypothet-
 ical stories (r = -.50, p < .001). These
 correlations suggest that, compared to other
 mothers, mothers who endorse aggression as
 an acceptable means of resolving conflict are
 more likely to report that they model aggres-
 sion, overly restrict the child's behavior, and
 infrequently employ proactive teaching.
 Mothers who model aggression and are re-
 strictive with their child are also somewhat
 less likely to report that their child has had
 much direct experience with peers.

 Together, these correlations suggest that
 the facets of the child's early social experi-
 ence, as we have measured them, are orga-
 nized in predictable and meaningful ways.

 SEX AND SOCIOMETRIC STATUS
 DIFFERENCES

 Since prior literature suggested that sex
 and social status differences may be present
 in children's social problem solving and so-
 cial experience, our next step in data analysis
 was to compare boys and girls and status
 groups on these measures. Multivariate anal-
 yses of variance (MANOVAs) were calculated
 for each set of measures. No significant sex
 differences or sex x status interactions were
 found.4 A significant multivariate effect for
 status did emerge for the social problem solv-
 ing measures, F(10,72) = 2.06, p < .05. Uni-
 variate tests indicated significant group differ-

 Classroom Competence Measures

 The first step in data analysis was the
 computation of bivariate correlations between
 measures within each of the three data do-
 mains.3 The intercorrelations of the classroom
 social competence measures were examined
 first and are presented in Table 1. Children
 who were socially accepted in the classroom
 were rated as more socially skilled (r = .67, p
 < .001) and less aggressive (r = -.49, p <
 .001) by their teachers and peers. Socially
 skilled children were seen as less aggressive
 (r = -.59, p < .001) by teachers and peers.
 Social Problem Solving Measures

 Correlation coefficients were next com-

 puted among the five social problem solving
 measures (see Table 1). The measure of chil-
 dren's willingness to aggress was unrelated to
 any of the measures derived from the Social
 Problem Solving (SPS) Test. Children gener-
 ating the greatest number of solutions on the
 SPS test were more likely to generate rele-
 vant solutions (r = .42, p < .001), perhaps

 3 Due to the possibility of nonnormal distributions of scores among these measures, scatterplots
 were obtained for all correlations. The number of outlying cases was small in comparison to the
 number of correlations calculated, and no one case was outlying across different sets of correlations.
 Deletion of these outliers did not significantly alter the correlational patterns.

 4 Although the multivariate effects for the sex x status interactions were nonsignificant, inspec-

 tion of cell N's revealed that boys and girls were distributed unevenly across status groups, that is,
 88% (eight of nine) of the children in the rejected group were boys.

 ences for number of responses generated on
 the SPS test, F(2,39) = 4.56, p < .02, and the
 proportion of prosocial responses, F(2,39) =
 3.41, p < .05. Post hoc comparisons (LSD
 method) indicated that popular children (M =
 5.11) generated significantly more solutions to
 the SPS stories than did either average/un-
 classified (M = 3.88) or rejected children (M
 = 3.04). A greater proportion of the solutions
 of popular children were classified as proso-
 cial (M = .72) compared to children in the
 average/unclassified group (M = .43).

 A marginally significant multivariate ef-
 fect for status was also found for the early-
 experience measures, F(12,66) = 1.76, p <
 .08. The univariate tests were examined be-
 cause of conceptual interest in the relation be-
 tween family experience and social status
 with peers. However, caution should be exer-
 cised in interpreting these differences. Sig-
 nificant univariate effects emerged for the en-
 dorsement-of-aggression measure, F(2,37) =
 4.67, p < .02, and for direct peer experience,
 F(2,37) = 3.37, p < .05. Post hoc comparisons
 revealed that popular children (M = 11.00)
 were rated as having had more prior peer ex-
 perience than either the average/unclassified
 (M = 8.48) or rejected children (M = 6.87),
 and mothers of popular children were less
 likely to endorse aggression (M = 10.25) than
 were mothers of average/unclassified (M =
 18.22) or rejected children (M = 20.57).

 sures. Peer- and teacher-rated social skill was
 significantly predicted by the family-ex-
 perience measures (R = .58, p < .01). Social
 preference and aggressiveness were not sig-
 nificantly related to the early experience mea-
 sures (R's = .42 and .37, respectively, both
 N.S.). Examination of bivariate correlations
 (shown in Table 1) revealed that social skill
 was significantly related to mothers' reports of
 direct peer experience (r = .33, p < .05),
 mothers' biased expectations for the child's
 behavior (r = -.40, p < .01), mothers' en-
 dorsement of aggression (r = -.39, p < .01),
 and restrictive discipline style (r = -.25, p <
 .05). Similarly, social preference was related
 to direct peer experience (r = .25, p < .05),
 mothers' biased expectations (r = -.25, p <
 .05), and mothers' endorsement of aggression
 (r = -.30, p < .05). Classroom aggression
 was predicted only by restrictive discipline (r
 = .28, p < .05). Children who are more so-
 cially competent in the classroom are thus
 more likely to have had opportunities to in-
 teract with other children (according to their
 mothers) and are less likely to have restrictive
 mothers or mothers who have deviant values
 (endorsing aggression) and expectations (mak-
 ing hostile attributions about their child in
 hypothetical contexts). Overall, these results
 indicate that there is a modest level of predic-
 tion from the early social experience mea-
 sures to children's classroom competence.
 Social Problem Solving and Early Family
 Experience

 In the next set of analyses, the predict-
 ability of the social problem solving measures
 from the early experience measures was as-
 sessed. The number-of-solutions measure was
 significantly related to the early-experience
 measures (R = .58, p < .01). The proportion
 of relevant solutions and the proportion of
 prosocial solutions were also marginally re-
 lated to the early-experience measures (R =
 .50, p < .06, and R = .49, p < .08, respec-
 tively). The proportion of aggressive solutions
 and overall aggressive responding were not
 predictable from early family experience (R's
 = .31 and .39, respectively). Bivariate correla-
 tions are presented in Table 1. The early-ex-
 perience measures exhibiting the strongest
 pattern of prediction are mothers' biases
 about the child and mothers' endorsement of
 aggression. These variables are clearly associ-
 ated with lowered levels of social problem
 solving skill. The remaining correlations are
 also predictable and interpretable, with the
 exception of the positive correlation between
 exposure to aggressive models and the num-
 ber of solutions generated.

 INTERDOMAIN RELATIONS

 Social Competence and Social Problem
 Solving

 Multiple correlational analyses evaluated
 the predictability of each of the classroom-
 competence measures from the five social
 problem solving measures. The multiple cor-
 relations for social preference and social skill
 were .65 and .60, respectively (both p < .01).
 Peer- and teacher-rated aggressiveness was
 less strongly predicted by the social cognitive
 measures (R = .42, N.S.). The bivariate corre-
 lations between the social cognitive measures
 and social preference and social skill are
 shown in Table 1. Comparable patterns of re-
 lations are apparent for each classroom-com-
 petence measure. Competence in the class-
 room is associated with the ability to generate
 numerous, highly relevant, and prosocial so-
 lutions to the SPS test.

 ing effect of social problem solving skill was
 greatest for mothers' biases (a change from
 -.39 to -.12) and endorsement of aggression
 (-.27 to -.05), and least for direct peer expe-
 rience (.33 to .29). In order to examine the
 possible mediating effect of the social prob-
 lem solving measures on each early experi-
 ence measure, another series of stepwise re-
 gression analyses were computed, in which
 the social problem solving measures were
 again entered first, followed by a single fam-
 ily-experience measure. The only family-ex-
 perience measure making a significant incre-
 mental prediction was direct peer experience
 (R2 change = .08, p < .05).

 TESTING MODELS OF DEVELOPMENTAL
 PATHS

 The Path from Family Experiences to Social
 Problem Solving to Social Competence

 The preceding results provide evidence
 of the links among early social experience, so-
 cial problem solving patterns, and children's
 competence with peers. In the next set of
 analyses, we tested the hypothesis that the
 relation between early experience and class-
 room competence is mediated by the child's
 social problem solving patterns. Thus, the re-
 lation between competence and experience
 was assessed while controlling statistically for
 variations in the five social problem solving
 measures. This was done by conducting a
 stepwise regression analysis for each class-
 room-competence measure in which the so-
 cial problem solving measures were entered
 first, followed by the early family experience
 measures. Early family experience did not
 provide significant incremental prediction of
 either social preference or classroom aggres-
 siveness, which is not surprising given that
 the relation between these measures had pre-
 viously been found to be nonsignificant.
 However, the relation between social skill
 and early family experience, which previ-
 ously had been significant, was no longer so
 when the social problem solving measures
 were entered first. The results from this re-
 gression analysis are presented in Table 2.
 Examination of the changes in magnitudes of
 the beta coefficients of individual family ex-
 perience measures suggests that the mediat-

 It would appear, then, that children's so-
 cial problem solving patterns serve a mediat-
 ing role in the relation between early experi-
 ence and at least one facet of classroom
 competence-children's social skill as rated
 by teachers and peers. Of course, the possibil-
 ity exists that no mediation is actually taking
 place, but rather for some measures social ex-
 perience and social problem solving are re-
 dundant, or interchangeable. This possibility
 was examined next.

 The Path from Family Experiences to Social
 Competence to Problem Solving Patterns

 In the next set of analyses we examined
 the degree to which the relation between
 early social experience and social problem
 solving was mediated by children's compe-
 tence with peers in the classroom. To do this
 we again performed a series of stepwise re-

 gression analyses (one for each social problem
 solving measure) in which the three class-
 room-competence measures were entered
 first, followed by the early family experience
 measures. As before, the proportion of aggres-
 sive solutions generated and overall aggres-
 sive responding were not predicted by the
 early-experience measures. The measures of
 relevancy and prosocial responding, which
 had been marginally predicted by early expe-
 rience, were not incrementally predicted
 (even marginally so) by the early-experience
 measures. However, the number-of-solutions
 measure was incrementally predicted by
 early experience (R2 change = .23, p < .05).
 These results suggest that, at least for the
 number of solutions generated, classroom
 competence does not serve a mediating role
 in the relation between social problem solv-
 ing and early family experience.

 The Path from Social Problem Solving to
 Family Experiences to Social Competence

 A final possible path of influence is that
 leading from social problem solving to early
 family experience to social competence. This
 path was tested in the same manner as those
 described before. Stepwise regression analy-
 ses were performed for each classroom com-
 petence measure, with the early family expe-
 rience measures entered first, followed by the
 social problem solving measures.

 Not surprisingly, given the earlier de-
 scribed results, social problem solving did
 not provide a significant incremental predic-
 tion for classroom aggression. However, so-
 cial skill in the classroom, which had been
 strongly predicted by social problem solving,
 also was not incrementally predicted by these
 measures. Social preference, on the other
 hand, was not predicted by early experience
 but was incrementally predicted by social
 problem solving. The results from these re-
 gressions are presented in Table 3.

 For the two classroom-competence mea-
 sures that were predicted by social problem
 solving, one (social skill) loses that prediction
 once the variance attributable to early family
 experience has been partialed out. Examina-
 tion of changes in the magnitudes of the beta
 coefficients indicates that the mediating role
 of early family experience was greatest for the
 SPS-relevancy measure (a change from .44 to
 .08). Changes in the sizes of the beta coeffi-
 cients for all other social problem solving
 measures were minimal. It would appear,
 then, that skill in generating relevant re-
 sponses to hypothetical social problems pre-

 dicts actual classroom social skill only in con-
 junction with early family experience.

 Discussion

 The present study provides a demonstra-
 tion of the linkages among early social and
 familial experiences (as described by moth-
 ers), children's social problem solving, and
 social competence with peers. Most prior in-
 vestigations focusing on the familial origins of
 children's competence have been based on
 the hypothesis that parenting behavior affects
 and is affected by child behavior, with both
 kinds of effects operating directly on the de-
 velopment of children's social adjustment
 (e.g., see review by Maccoby & Martin, 1983).

 In the present study, an alternative path
 of influence was conceptualized and tested
 empirically. Specifically, it was hypothesized
 that early family and social experiences
 would predict variations in children's social
 problem solving skills, which would then in
 turn predict children's competence with
 peers. We obtained partial support for this hy-
 pothesis. The relation between the peer- and
 teacher-based measure of social skill and
 early family experience, which was quite
 strong, was found to be mediated by social
 problem solving. The early-experience mea-
 sures demonstrating the most dramatic
 change in prediction as a result of this media-
 tion were mothers' biased expectations and
 endorsement of aggression. The early-experi-
 ence measure showing the smallest absolute
 level of change in prediction was the amount
 of direct experience with peers. This suggests
 the possibility of a developmental path of in-
 fluence running from maternal values and ex-
 pectations to child social cognition to child
 social competence with peers. This indirect
 path of influence could be due to the covert
 but pervasive nature of mothers' attitudes,
 values, and expectations (see Costanzo & Dix,
 1983). These maternal qualities may be trans-
 mitted through verbal means and may influ-
 ence the child's behavior in a more subtle
 fashion than do other forms of early experi-
 ence, such as harsh discipline or experience
 playing with peers. Perhaps through a gradual
 process of exposure to deviant maternal val-
 ues, the child learns to process social informa-
 tion in a deviant way in peer settings. Be-
 cause the child is unable to generate and
 enact competent responses in these social sit-
 uations, the child comes to be perceived by
 teachers and peers as socially incompetent.
 Likewise, the child who has learned how to
 think about social situations from the mother's
 influence may be able to behave in ways that

 lead to positive perceptions by peers and
 teachers.

 The relation between parents' values and
 expectations and children's competence has
 been the object of increasingly sophisticated
 study in recent years (e.g., see Sigel, 1985),
 but the possible mechanisms governing this
 relation have yet to be clearly specified. The
 previously mentioned study by Putallaz
 (1987) has come closest to providing such in-
 formation. Putallaz found mothers' social val-
 ues (expressed in terms of advised solutions
 to a hypothetical situation involving her child
 being teased) were predictive of children's
 social status in the classroom; however, so-
 lutions to hypothetical situations involving
 other social problems (e.g., entry into a new

 group) were not predictive. The children's re-
 sponses to the hypothetical social problems
 also predicted their peer competence. Putal-
 laz did examine the potentially important re-
 lation between mothers' social cognitive re-
 sponses and the children's social cognitive
 responses but found no significant correla-
 tions. The results of the present study suggest
 that this relation may serve as the mechanism
 by which mothers' social cognitions influence
 children's competence.

 The relation between prior peer experi-
 ence and classroom competence remained es-
 sentially unchanged following the removal of
 variance attributable to social problem solv-
 ing. Prior peer experience, as described by
 mothers, thus appears to be tied somewhat

 more directly to a lack of peer competence, as
 indexed by socially unskilled behavior in the
 classroom, than the other kinds of early expe-
 rience we assessed. This may be because
 prior peer experience provides the child with
 opportunities for learning and practicing so-
 cial behaviors (Roopnarine, 1985). The enact-
 ment of behaviors learned through this pro-
 cess does not appear to be contingent on the
 child's conscious cognitive recognition of ap-
 propriate social responses.

 The present study also examined two
 other kinds of possible linkages among early
 experience, social problem solving, and chil-
 dren's competence. One set of analyses
 focused on the degree to which social compe-
 tence mediated the relation between early ex-
 perience and social problem solving. Little
 support was found for this kind of mediation.
 That is, the one social problem solving mea-
 sure significantly related to early experience,
 number of solutions generated, retained this
 prediction even after the influence of class-
 room competence had been removed. An-
 other set of analyses examined the degree to
 which family experience mediated the rela-
 tion between problem solving and compe-
 tence. These findings were inconclusive. So-
 cial preference was significantly related to
 both kinds of measure. Classroom social skill,
 on the other hand, was no longer predicted by
 social problem solving following the removal
 of variance attributable to early experience.
 The relevancy of responses generated ap-
 peared to be mediated to the greatest degree
 by the early-experience measures. Given the
 equivocal nature of these findings, it cannot
 be concluded that only one kind of mediation
 takes place in the relation among early experi-
 ence, social problem solving, and classroom
 competence. However, the overall pattern
 seems to be more suggestive with respect to
 the mediating role of social problem solving
 in the relation between early experience and
 social competence.

 An important contribution of the present
 study is its replication and extension of prior
 research on sociometric status differences in
 children's development. The finding that so-
 cially rejected children exhibit deviant pat-
 terns of processing social information is con-
 sistent with prior work (e.g., Dodge, Pettit,
 McClaskey, & Brown, 1986). We are among
 the first, however, to document the existence
 of differences in family and social relation-
 ship histories among children of differing lev-
 els of social status. Socially rejected children,
 compared to popular children, were found to
 be growing up in less advantageous circum-

 stances, with fewer opportunities for positive
 interactions with parents and peers, and with
 physical aggression both endorsed and prac-
 ticed by parents.

 The sociometric status differences that

 did emerge in this study, and indeed all rela-
 tions among competence and early experi-
 ence that were found, were probably affected
 somewhat by the extremity of the current
 study's sample. A restricted range of child-
 rearing environments was observed in the
 sample, and overall competence levels shown
 by the children were quite restricted in com-
 parison to what would be found in more het-
 erogeneous samples. These factors may have
 inflated the magnitude of the findings and
 may also have contributed to the lack of vari-
 ability in some of the social problem solving
 measures. We initially attempted to obtain a
 measure of children's hostile attributional
 bias. Based on past research (e.g., Dodge,
 1980; Dodge et al., 1984), we had reason to
 believe that reliable and meaningful mea-
 sures of bias could be constructed for 5-year-
 old children. However, almost all the chil-
 dren in the current sample were highly
 biased in their attributions (in the direction of
 presuming hostility), appearing to focus al-
 most exclusively on outcome of hypothetical
 provocations rather than intention, apparently
 making the assumption that the intention was
 hostile since the outcome was always nega-
 tive. We are not entirely sure why this oc-
 curred, but we can speculate that because of
 the relatively high degree of social trauma
 and stress experienced by these children
 (e.g., 54% of the mothers and 30% of the chil-
 dren were suspected to have been victims of
 abuse), and the fact that the mothers of most
 of the children were receiving welfare assis-
 tance and were distrustful of "outsiders,"
 these children may, as a group, have already
 learned to overattribute hostility, regardless
 of circumstance. Research comparing the
 social information processing of disadvan-
 taged and nondisadvantaged preschoolers is
 needed to address this issue. It is possible
 that there exists a correlation between disad-
 vantaged background and attributional biases
 that could not be detected in the present
 study because of a restricted range in family
 background.

 A limitation of the present research is its
 reliance on mothers' retrospective reports of
 early family and social experience. Although
 it is true that for some kinds of information
 there is no substitute for self-report (e.g., val-
 ues regarding aggression), for many kinds of
 measures direct observation would have been

 desirable. This is especially true for disciplin-
 ary practices and parental teaching. Another
 limitation is that measures representing the
 three domains of interest (competence with
 peers, social problem solving skill, and social
 experience) were obtained concurrently.
 Thus, it cannot be said that early experiences
 antecede social problem solving which ante-
 cede peer competence. Rather, it can only be
 said that these three kinds of measures co-
 vary. A longitudinal study in which early ex-
 periences are assessed prior to school entry
 would be the optimal research strategy for ad-
 dressing these important issues. Finally, it
 must be recognized that the present research
 provides only one of many possible tests of
 the mediation hypothesis. Early family expe-
 rience was perhaps conceptualized more nar-
 rowly in the present research than was social
 problem solving skill. However, our goal was
 not to provide an exhaustive account of early
 experience but rather to identify one poten-
 tially important set of descriptors and evalu-
 ate the degree to which their relation to social
 competence was mediated by social problem
 solving. Additional research is needed to clar-
 ify which forms of early experience are most
 crucial for children's acquisition of social
 competence.

 In summary, the findings from this study
 suggest that social competence, social prob-
 lem solving, and social experience are linked
 in complex but understandable ways. These
 findings highlight the importance of consider-
 ing both social problem solving patterns and
 family experience history when constructing
 models of the development of children's com-
 petence. If the social skills necessary to effect
 successful entry into the peer group are
 learned in part through early family experi-
 ence, as was suggested in the present study,
 then it may be possible to develop family-
 based preventive interventions that can be
 implemented before children experience the
 negative consequences of peer rejection. The
 present study has suggested a number of
 leads for future research to pursue. Eventu-
 ally such research may be able to identify the
 key elements of early experience that give
 rise to individual differences in children's
 competence.
