Cross-sectional and longitudinal relations
between mother-child talk about conﬂict and
children’s social understanding

We examined the relations between the ways 48 mothers and their 3- to 5-year-olds
talked about a conﬂict depicted in a picture book and their children’s current and
subsequent level of social understanding. We distinguished explanatory talk, which
directed attention to the actions that generated the conﬂict, from non-explanatory talk,
which discussed the conﬂict in terms of, for example, making up or saying sorry.
Controlling for child age and overall talk by mother, explanatory talk was positively
associated with contemporaneous social understanding. Social understanding at time
one was also positively associated with social understanding 30 months later. These
data suggest that dialogue about conﬂict may be helpful for 3- to 5-year old children’s
understanding of the mental world, to the extent that it facilitates their understanding
of particular social situations.

It is now well established that children’s social cognitive development is closely related
to aspects of their social experience (for reviews see, for example, Carpendale & Lewis,
2004, 2006). Although the focus of much of this research has been on children’s
understanding that beliefs can be false, which is considered an essential aspect of an
understanding of mind (e.g. Perner, 1991), some researchers have investigated later
developing social cognitive transitions such as coming to an interpretive understanding
of beliefs (e.g. Carpendale & Chandler, 1996; Lalonde & Chandler, 2002). Other bodies
of research have investigated children’s understanding of emotions (e.g. Denham,
1998), and some have considered social understanding as constituted by an
understanding of both emotion and belief (e.g. Dunn, Brown, Slomkowki, Tesla, &
Youngblade, 1991).

There is growing consensus that aspects of

the relationships that children
experience such as parenting (Hughes, Deater-Deckard, & Cutting, 1999; Pears &

Moses, 2003; Ruffman, Perner, & Parkin, 1999; Vinden, 2001), as well as family discourse
about the psychological world are associated with advanced understanding of belief and
emotion (Dunn et al., 1991; Moore, Furrow, Chiasson, & Patriquin, 1994) and may play a
causal role in the development of children’s social understanding (Ruffman, Slade, &
Crowe, 2002). This sort of evidence has led to a great deal of debate concerning what it
is about social interaction and family talk about mind and emotions that facilitates the
development of social understanding (Astington & Baird, 2005; Carpendale & Lewis,
2004, 2006; Harris, 2005; Lohmann & Tomasello, 2003; Nelson, 1996; Nelson et al.,
2003; Racine, 2004; Racine & Carpendale, in press; Turnbull & Carpendale, 1999).

Disciplinary situations involving conﬂict between children are one context in which
family talk may play an important role in social cognitive development. Ruffman and
colleagues (1999) used a questionnaire to ask parents what they had done or would do
in ﬁve different disciplinary situations. They found that parents who reported that they
would ask their child to reﬂect on the feelings of others in disciplinary situations had
children who were more advanced in false belief understanding than their age-mates.
Dunn and colleagues (1991) have also suggested that disciplinary situations often
expose children to conﬂicting perspectives that might facilitate their understanding of
false beliefs and emotions. However, in order to beneﬁt from witnessing conﬂict,
children would presumably need to understand such situations. We suggest that one
way in which children learn about conﬂict is within conversation. Further, we propose
that social interaction is beneﬁcial for social development to the extent that such
interaction facilitates children’s understanding of particular social situations
(Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Carpendale, Lewis, Mu¨ller, & Racine, 2005; Racine, 2004;
Turnbull, 2003; Turnbull & Carpendale, 1999, 2001).

To assess this proposal, following Ruffman and colleagues (1999), we focus on the
different ways that parents and their young children talk about disciplinary situations.
One limitation of Ruffman et al.’s study, acknowledged by the authors, is a reliance on
parental self-reports. In another study on the role of parenting in social cognitive
development Hughes et al. (1999) utilized both observational and self-report measures
of parenting, but these yielded conﬂicting results. In further research on this topic,
rather than assessing general attitudes, Pears and Moses (2003) utilized a self-report
measure on speciﬁc parenting practices during only the preceding 24 hours (the Parent
Daily Report, Chamberlain & Reid, 1987). Still, social desirability in the above cases is a
concern, and even if parents were being totally honest they still might not know how
they would respond to their children in particular situations or remember exactly how
they did respond and thus not be able to complete their report accurately.

In order to build upon and extend Ruffman et al.’s study, we designed the present
study to overcome this limitation by examining actual discussions between parents and
their 3- to 5-year-old children. Unlike Hughes et al. (1999), our study is not concerned
with observation of a general parental disciplinary style, but rather with the details of
parent–child talk about a disciplinary situation and its relation to children’s social
development. Like Dunn and colleagues (1991), we conceive of social understanding in
a broader sense than Ruffman and colleagues (1999) in that in addition to assessing
children’s understanding of beliefs and we also assess their understanding of emotions
in relation to conﬂict. In particular, we investigate whether dyads differ in the extent to
which their talk seems helpful for learning about a speciﬁc conﬂict situation. In the
same way that Hughes and colleagues assume that a measure of parenting style reﬂects
something about the way in which parent and child interact, we assume that a sample of
parent–child talk reﬂects something about the dyad’s typical interaction.

Conﬂict and social understanding

523

In conceptualizing forms of talk and relationships in terms of whether or not they
facilitate development by helping children understand situations, we draw on Piaget’s,
(1932/1965, 1977/1995) distinction between constraint and cooperation. According to
Piaget, relationships of constraint are based on an imbalance of power and one-sided
respect. This means that parents may not feel obliged to fully explain the reasons for
their position and can simply imposes their own point of view. In contrast, cooperative
relationships are characterized by mutual respect and therefore parents will be
motivated to achieve mutual understanding by fully explaining their position and
attempting to understand the child’s views. Piaget argued that this form of relationship is
best suited for the achievement of mutual understanding and the developmental of
knowledge. We suggest that this is a fruitful framework within which to understand the
work of Ruffman and colleagues (1999) and Dunn and colleagues (1991). Such a
framework could also be applied to other aspects of the parent–child relationship. To
give one example, reported relations between high and low elaborative parental talk
and children’s autobiographical memory could be seen in this light (see, for example,
Nelson & Fivush, 2004). That is, cooperative relationships may be typiﬁed by elaborative
talk, whereas constraining relations may be typiﬁed by non-elaborative talk.

There are, of course, different ways to assess parent–child talk and the nature of
relationships. One approach is in-home observation. This has the advantage of
naturalistic observation but the disadvantage that families would talk about different
events. We argue that it is important that all the parent–child dyads talk about the same
conﬂict because this reduces variability in parental response due to the varying nature
of disciplinary situations. We therefore asked dyads to discuss the same series of
drawings presented as a wordless picture book depicting a conﬂict between two
siblings and their mother’s intervention. Thus, all dyads talked about the same event but
because they were not constrained by text in the book it was possible to examine their
different ways of construing the event and its resolution. We could accordingly compare
families’ different ways of dealing with a disciplinary situation with the child’s
independent performance on tests of social understanding.

We examined aspects of the talk that might facilitate understanding of the conﬂict.
Speciﬁcally, we distinguished forms of talk that directed attention to the actions that
generated the conﬂict from talk that seemed to simply involve telling the child what
should be done without necessarily leading the child to a more complete appreciation of
the conﬂict. The ﬁrst form of talk we refer to as explanatory talk, which is talk that directs
attention to the intentions and motivation and consequences of the actions that
generated the conﬂict. We argue that this form of talk reﬂects a cooperative relationship in
that it shows an attempt to help the child understand the psychological context of the
conﬂict. For example, saying that it is not nice that one child took a sibling’s possession
and that it is not nice that the sibling reacted by pushing, should direct the child’s
attention to the reasons for the actions as well as the consequences for the other sibling’s
feelings and this should help the child more completely understand the two perspectives
in conﬂict. This ﬁts with Ruffman et al.’s (1999) ﬁnding that parents who reported talking
to their child about the feelings of the other child when their child was involved in a
disciplinary situation had children who were advanced in false belief understanding.

We refer to the second form as non-explanatory talk because it merely imposes a
solution, such as the story characters being told that they should say sorry or be friends
again, without explicitly drawing the child’s attention to why the two siblings depicted in
the picture book are in conﬂict. We argue that this form of talk reﬂects a relationship of
constraint because adult solutions, such as ‘stop it, don’t ﬁght’, ‘say sorry’, and ‘make

friends’ are simply imposed without an attempt to ensure that the child fully understands
the causes of the conﬂict and the thoughts and feelings of the children involved (Ruffman
et al., 1999). There is nothing inherently negative about non-explanatory talk but it does
seem to presuppose that an understanding of the conﬂict is already in place and may do
little to facilitate such an understanding if it is lacking. As such we expected that
explanatory talk would be positively associated with children’s social understanding,
whereas non-explanatory talk would not be associated with social understanding.

In this study, we investigated the cross-sectional relations between these forms of
talk and 3- to 5-year-old children’s social understanding by assessing these children’s
understanding of beliefs and emotions. False belief understanding was measured using
the unexpected transfer and unexpected contents paradigms (e.g. Gopnik & Astington,
1988; Wimmer & Perner, 1983) because these are well-established tests of children’s
understanding of belief. For similar reasons, we used Denham’s (1986) measures of
affective labelling and perspective-taking as our measures of emotion understanding. We
then investigated the longitudinal relations between explanatory and non-explanatory
talk and these children’s social understanding some 30 months later by assessing
children’s understanding of beliefs and emotions with tasks more appropriate for that
age group. We used Carpendale and Chandler’s (1996)
interpretative
understanding and Dunn’s (1995) mixed emotions test. Both of these assess later
arriving social cognitive transitions that are appropriate for the age of this sample.

Method
Participants
Forty-eight mothers and their children (24 girls, 24 boys) participated in this study when
the children were 37 to 69 months of age (M ¼ 53:52, SD ¼ 8:82).1 A follow-up visit
occurred on average 30 months later (range ¼ 27 – 34, SD ¼ 1:4). This was a broad
urban community sample selected from a western Canadian city. Eighty-six per cent of
the children were Caucasian, 10% were Asian and 4% were of African descent. Given the
educational and employment status of parents in this study, this was a primarily middle
class sample.2

Design and procedure
Sixty per cent of the Time 1 observational sessions were conducted in a university
laboratory and the remainder was conducted in participants’ homes.3 Dyads were
videotaped while they were engaged in two tasks designed to elicit talk about the
mental world. The interaction task employed in the present article explicitly depicted a
conﬂict that was held constant across all participants; the other interaction task did not

1 Two grandmother–child dyads and six father–child dyads were excluded from analyses.
2 Thirty-nine per cent of mothers had completed a university degree, 55% had attended a university or college, and the
remainder had all completed high school. Eighty-one per cent of these dyads were from two-parent families. In the two-parent
families, 35% of spouses had completed a university degree, 35% had attended a university or college, 8% had completed high
school, and the remainder had completed elementary school. Thirty-seven per cent of the parents were employed full-time,
46% were employed part-time, and the remainder was unemployed. In two-parent families, 91% of spouses worked full-time,
4% worked part-time, and the remainder was unemployed.
3 Dyads were assessed in the laboratory or at home at the mothers’ convenience because the present study involved a simple
storybook task and the administration of straightforward protocols. There were no differences in the measures as a function of
where the data were collected.

and was therefore not selected for analysis in the present article. We then assessed
children’s false belief and emotion understanding. The order of presentation of the two
interaction tasks and the measures of social understanding was counterbalanced for
approximately half of the period of data collection; for the second half of the data
collection the interaction tasks were presented before the social understanding
measures.4 Sixty-eight per cent of the Time 2 follow-up observational sessions were
conducted in a university laboratory and the remainder were conducted in participants’
homes. Children were administered two Time 2 social understanding measures that
were appropriate in complexity for the age of the children at the time of follow up,
namely the understanding of interpretation and mixed emotion.

Dyads were asked to make up a story based on a picture book without text depicting
two children, Sarah and Billy, getting chocolate bars from their mother. Sarah immediately
eats her chocolate bar, making a mess in the process. Billy saves his chocolate bar for later
by hiding it under a sleeping dog. Unbeknownst to Billy, Sarah sees him hide the
chocolate, and while he is outside playing she takes Billy’s chocolate and puts it in her
pocket. When Billy returns to look for his chocolate, he does not ﬁnd it under the dog.
When Sarah laughs at this, Billy gets angry, pushes Sarah off a chair, and the chocolate bar
falls out of her pocket. At this point their mother intervenes and is shown talking to each
child individually. The resolution of the conﬂict between the children is shown in a
picture in which the mother is standing with the two children beside her and they are
both smiling. It is important to note that the storybook task provides some structure so
that all the parent–child dyads needed to talk about the same event depicted in a series of
17 coloured drawings, yet there was no constraint on how the participants talked about
the event. Thus, this procedure gave us an indication of the manner in which and extent
to which these family dyads might talk about conﬂict situations while controlling to some
degree for the content of accounts that parents and children might give. We also took into
account overall talk by mother and overall talk by child (in words) in order to control for
the amount of talk used in conversations about the story.

Scoring

Time 1 mother–child talk about conﬂict
We transcribed the videotaped mother–child interaction, and coded transcriptions for
the ways in which the dyads talked about Billy and Sarah’s actions and their mother’s
intervention. Parents overwhelmingly initiated the majority of talk about the picture
book (90% on average). There were no differences as a function of whether parent or
child initiated the talk related to the variables under study.

A research assistant coded transcripts for the presence of 50 storybook elements that
might be helpful for understanding the entire story depicted in the picture book.
A second research assistant coded 14 of these transcripts to establish reliability. Initially,
a total of 309 elements were identiﬁed across the 14 transcripts, and coders agreed on
269, for an 87% rate of agreement. After discussion, the coders agreed that 305 elements
were present. When the 305 elements were then independently coded for who

4 We were not always able to test children’s Time 1 understanding of false belief and emotion without the presence of the
parent. Given that parents may have picked up on what the tests were assessing and may have then focussed on the mental or
emotional states of the characters depicted in the storybook more than they normally might, we elected to discontinue
counterbalancing midway through the study. There were no differences as a function of
the presence/absence of
counterbalance in the variables examined in this study.

(i.e. parent or child) initiated and who produced the element, interrater reliability was
k ¼ :77 and¼.92, respectively.

The present study reports on a subset of 10 of the elements of the story related
speciﬁcally to discussing the conﬂict between Billy and Sarah and the manner in which
their mother dealt with it (see Table 1). The relevant sections of the storybook for
present purposes include dialogue pertaining to: (a) Sarah taking Billy’s sweets; (b) Billy
pushing Sarah off the chair for taking his sweets; (c) the point at which Billy and Sarah’s
mother intervenes; and (d) the children are happy again standing by their mother.

Non-explanatory talk

Mother says ‘stop it, don’t ﬁght’
Sarah and Billy tell their sides

Mother tells Sarah and Billy what they should have done

Talk about Billy’s, Sarah’s and the mother’s actions was coded for the degree to which
such conversation should help a child reach an understanding of the conﬂict situation.
Talk that seemed to draw attention to the speciﬁc details and feelings of the characters
involved and encouraged children to think about the consequences of actions for the
other characters was coded as explanatory talk. Talk that seemed to orient to the conﬂict
situation in terms that were not clearly linked to Billy and Sarah’s actions, thoughts and
feelings was coded as non-explanatory talk.

In order to demonstrate the way which these two mutually-exclusive categories are
meant to be conceived, the non-explanatory talk element ‘M tells S and B what they
should have done’ was coded as non-explanatory because it does not specify what Sarah
and Billy should have done and as such it may be of little value to a child who does not
understand the conﬂict being depicted. Further, simply imposing a solution like this
does little to direct the child’s attention to Billy and Sarah’s thoughts and feelings that
might underlie the conﬂict and result from the conﬂict. In this sense it is similar to
‘Mother says “stop it, don’t ﬁght”’ or ‘Sarah and Billy tell their sides’. The utterances
‘Billy and Sarah make friends/should make friends’ or ‘say sorry/should say sorry’ may
show that these children are in conﬂict and therefore facilitate a child’s understanding of
conﬂict. However, consistent with Ruffman et al. (1999), we would not expect such
utterances to be helpful because they simply impose a solution without requiring that
children think about the consequences of actions for others. Simply put, telling children
in conﬂict to say sorry/be friends does not necessarily help them understand their
interlocutors’ perspective. This may be the reason that Ruffman et al. found that parents
who report imposing these sorts of conventional solutions on their children in conﬂict
situations have children who are less socially mature. Compare these statements with
the explanatory items ‘Mother says that Sarah shouldn’t take Billy’s chocolate bar’,

‘Mother says that Billy shouldn’t push Sarah’ and ‘It is not nice that Billy pushed Sarah’,
wherein both Sarah’s and Billy’s actions are concretely shown to be inappropriate. In
contrast to simply imposing a solution, directing children’s attention to the moral
implications of Billy and Sarah’s actions should encourage them to think about the
consequences of the actions for the others’ feelings. Indeed Ruffman et al. (1999) found
that parents who report adopting such a strategy in their interactions with their children
around conﬂict had children with more advanced social cognition.

Total Time 1 mother–child talk about conﬂict
Total mother talk was measured by counting the number of words uttered by the
mother overthe course of the section of the interaction task that speciﬁcally addressed
the conﬂict between Billy and Sarah; total child talk was measured by counting the
number of words uttered by the child in this section of the story.

Time 1 social understanding measures
False belief understanding was measured using the unexpected transfer and unexpected
contents tests (e.g. Gopnik & Astington, 1988; Wimmer & Perner, 1983). In the
unexpected transfer task, children were shown a puppet (Maxi) leaving a toy in one
location and exiting a room. While Maxi is outside, the toy is moved to a different
location by a second puppet. Maxi returns and is about to look for the toy. Children were
asked, ‘Where do you think Maxi will look for the toy?’ and ‘Why do you think Maxi will
look there?’ In the unexpected contents task, children were shown a Smarties box (a
sweet well known to Canadian children), and asked ‘What do you think is inside this
box?’ After they had answered ‘Smarties’ or ‘candies’ they were shown that the box
actually contained crayons. Children were then told that a puppet character named
Mary hadn’t seen inside the box and they were asked, ‘What would Mary think is inside
the box?’

On the unexpected transfer task, children were given a point for correctly predicting
where they thought Maxi would look for the toy and another point for correctly
explaining why Maxi would look there. Answers that were based solely on desire were
considered incorrect. If children were incorrect on the prediction question they were
told where Maxi would actually look and then they were asked the explanation
question. Thus, it was possible for children to fail the prediction question but when
corrected to go on to explain that Maxi would look in that location because that is where
he left it. On the unexpected contents task, after children had conﬁrmed that they
thought the box contained Smarties (or sweets) they were given a point for correctly
predicting what the puppet would think the box contained Smarties or sweets. This
results in a possible maximum score of 3.

To assess understanding of emotions, children were administered an expressive
labelling task where they were asked to label the emotions depicted by drawings of a
female face expressing one of ﬁve emotions (happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised), and a
receptive labelling task where children were shown these same drawings and asked to
point to the face that expressed the given emotion. An understanding of more complex
emotions was assessed using measures of affective perspective taking (adapted from
Denham, 1986). In the affective perspective taking task, children were presented with
ﬁve story cards that depicted an event requiring the child to infer a character’s emotion

528 Timothy P. Racine et al.

from the situation described. The character’s face was blank, and the child had to select
from ﬁve detachable faces expressing the same emotions as above.

On the receptive and expressive labelling tasks, children received one point for
reporting the correct emotion for a total possible score of 10. On the affective
perspective taking task, children received one point for selecting the correct face and
one point for reporting the correct emotion for a possible total score of 10.
total possible score of 23 (a ¼ :78).

All Time 1 social understanding measures were combined into a single scale with a

Time 2 social understanding measures
Children’s understanding of interpretation was assessed by presenting them with a
series of three situations in which two puppet characters, Maxi and Mary, were each
made to offer different, but equally legitimate,
interpretations of the very same
ambiguous stimuli. The three types of ambiguous stimuli used were referential, lexical
and ﬁgural. Children were asked to explain the source of the diversity in interpretation
and to state whether or not they could predict how another puppet would interpret the
same ambiguous stimuli (Carpendale & Chandler, 1996).

In the case of referential ambiguity, the child watched the experimenter tell two
puppets that a sticker was hidden under a card with a picture of a big block. This
statement was referentially ambiguous because there were three cards; two with big
blocks, one red and one blue, and one with a small red block. Each of the two puppets
was made to interpret the statement in one of the two possible ways; in particular, one
puppet said that the sticker was under the big blue block, whereas the other puppet
said that it was under the big red block. In the case of lexical ambiguity, the two puppets
were both told to ‘wait for a ring’. Again, the two puppets endorsed two different but
equally legitimate meanings of the word ring; namely, one puppet said he was waiting
for a ring for his ﬁnger, whereas the other puppet said she was waiting for the telephone
to ring. Finally, in the case of ﬁgural ambiguity, puppets were shown Jastrow’s (1900)
classic ‘duck-rabbit’ ambiguous ﬁgure, which can be seen as either a duck or a rabbit.
One puppet was made to claim that it was a duck, whereas the other claimed that it was
really a rabbit. Presentation of
the three types of ambiguous situations was
counterbalanced.

The experimenter ﬁrst ensured that the child understood both interpretations of the
ambiguous statement about the boxes, both meanings of the ambiguous word, and
could see both the duck and the rabbit in the ambiguous ﬁgure. When the child was
clearly faced with the two conﬂicting interpretations of the very same stimulus, the
experimenter asked two types of questions, an explanation question and a prediction
question. The explanation question involved asking children why Mary and Maxi say
two different things. This was followed up with a probe question: ‘Does it make sense
for Mary to say one thing and Maxi to say something else?’ The prediction question
involved asking children if they could predict how a third puppet would interpret the
same ambiguous stimuli.

Children were considered to have passed the explanation question by explaining
that both interpretations were legitimate because of the ambiguous nature of the
stimulus. Children failed this question if they insisted that one puppet had the correct
interpretation and the other puppet was wrong. Passing the prediction question
involved refusing to make a ﬁrm prediction about how another puppet might interpret
the ambiguous stimulus and explaining that it was not possible to predict because there

529

were two equally likely interpretations, or by making a prediction but acknowledging
that there was no way to be completely certain. Failing involved making a ﬁrm
prediction regarding the third puppet’s response to the ambiguous stimuli. Children
were given one point for each correct response to the explanation question and for each
correct response to the prediction question in the three ambiguity tasks, for a possible
score of 6.

In order to assess their understanding of mixed emotions, children were presented
with two situations in which a child might feel two emotions of opposite valence
(adapted from Dunn, 1995). In the ﬁrst situation, children were shown a drawing
depicting a child about to ride a bicycle with his/her father standing nearby (the stories
were matched for child gender). Children were told that the father was going to help the
child ride a two-wheeled bicycle for the ﬁrst time. They were asked a prediction
question, ‘How might Jason/Jennifer feel about riding a two-wheeled bicycle for the ﬁrst
time?’ Children were then asked to explain why Jason/Jennifer might feel that way. If
only one emotion was spontaneously reported, the child was then asked, ‘Is there
anything else that Jason/Jennifer might feel at the same time?’ followed again by the
explanation question. If the child still only reported one emotion, they were told
‘Actually, Jason/Jennifer feels both excited and scared’ and then asked ‘Why might
he/she feel both excited and scared about riding a two-wheeler for the ﬁrst time?’
(Dunn, 1995).

In the second story, Jason/Jennifer’s mother was to take Jason/Jennifer and his/her
best friend to the movies but children are told that the best friend phones to say s/he
cannot go because s/he is sick. The children are told that Jason/Jennifer will have to go
to the movie without his/her best friend. They are then asked a predictor question,
‘How might Jason/Jennifer feel about going to the movie without his/her best friend?’ As
before, if only one emotion is spontaneously predicted, the children were prompted for
an additional appropriate oppositely valenced emotion, and failing that were informed
that Jason/Jennifer would feel both happy and sad and asked why.

Children were given one point for one emotion predicted and another point for
explaining that emotion in each story. They were given two points for two appropriate
opposite valenced pairs of emotions predicted and two points for explaining these
emotions in each story. Children were given a ﬁnal point for each story if they generated
the two opposite valenced emotions spontaneously (i.e. without the prompting ‘Is
there anything else that Jason/Jennifer might feel?’). This resulted in a possible total
score of 10.

as hypothesized, rð47Þ ¼ :30, p , :05, the zero-order correlation between explanatory
talk and Time 1 social understanding was not, rð47Þ ¼ :25. However, child age was
associated with Time 1 social understanding, rð47Þ ¼ :52, p , :001. In addition, when
age was controlled, the correlation between explanatory talk and Time 1 social
understanding became signiﬁcant, prð45Þ ¼ :36, p , :05, whereas the correlation
between non-explanatory talk and Time 1 social understanding did not, prð45Þ ¼ :21.
In order to control for the covariances between all control (child age, total mother
talk, total child talk) and predictor variables (explanatory talk, non-explanatory talk), we
performed hierarchical linear regressions on Time 1 and Time 2 social understanding.

explanatory talk were signiﬁcant predictors of Time 1 social understanding, accounting
for 27 and 9% of the variance, respectively (see Table 4).5

Conﬂict and social understanding

Predicting Time 2 longitudinal social understanding from Time 1 child age, total mother talk, total
child talk, explanatory talk, non-explanatory talk and social understanding
Hierarchical regression analyses were performed to predict Time 2 social understanding
as a function of Time 1 social understanding, child age, total mother talk, total child talk,
explanatory talk and non-explanatory talk. The model was signiﬁcant, Fð6; 41Þ ¼ 3:387,
p , :01, accounting for 33% of the variance in children’s social understanding at Time 2.
Time 1 social understanding talk was the only signiﬁcant predictor of Time 2 social
understanding, accounting for 8% of the variance (see Table 4).

Discussion
Previous researchers (Dunn et al., 1991; Ruffman et al., 1999) have suggested that
exposure to conﬂict may be helpful for social understanding. We found that explanatory
talk about a conﬂict predicted 3- to 5-year-old children’s contemporaneous social
understanding over and above the variance it shared with age, non-explanatory talk,
total mother talk and total child talk. We also found that social understanding at Time 1
predicted children’s social understanding 21
2 years later. Thus, we have presented
evidence supportive of the view that ways of talking about conﬂict that facilitate
understanding is cross-sectionally associated with advanced social understanding for
3- to 5-year-old children. The former ﬁnding is consistent with the work of Ruffman and
colleagues (1999). The fact that social understanding is associated at both time points
gives us conﬁdence that our measures were assessing similar competencies. Although
the total variance explained in our models is considerable (40% at Time 1 and 33% at
Time 2), the amount of unique variance accounted for cross-sectionally by Time 1
explanatory talk and longitudinally by Time 1 social understanding was modest (9% and
8%), suggesting that other factors are also involved in this development. Still, these
variables have not been linked in many studies.

This is a correlational design but it is tempting to speculate about what might cause
what. We found an association between explanatory talk when children were 3–5 years
old and their social understanding, but although such talk was correlated with social
understanding 30 months later, this did not account for additional variance beyond Time
1 social understanding. It is possible that children who are more mature in terms of
social understanding are easier to talk to in a cooperative way and so they tend to elicit
this form of talk from their parents when they are 3–5 years old. Their level of social
understanding is also linked to their maturity in this area some years later. However, if
this interpretation were correct, then we should not expect explanatory talk to be a
signiﬁcant predictor of social understanding when age is taken into account because
low levels of such talk would be used when children are young and high levels when

5 When these scales are analysed individually, the Time 1 belief and Time 1 emotion measures and the Time 2 belief measures
are signiﬁcantly associated with Time 1 explanatory talk, but the Time 2 emotion measure was marginal. We have combined
the scales for ease of presentation and because the reliability was adequate.

Conﬂict and social understanding

children are older. However, we found that age and explanatory make independent
contributions at Time 1. We would argue instead that the ways in which parents talk to
their children facilitate social development, and these children’s social development at
Time 2 would be inﬂuenced by this relative maturity as well, presumably, by the
continued helpful parenting style we found at Time 1. A third possibility is that both
factors play a role in a bidirectional, transactional process of interaction. That is, parent–
child interaction may facilitate social development, which makes more complex forms
of interaction possible, and this interaction in turn results in further social development.
The storybook task used in this study provides some structure so that all the parent–
child dyads talked about the same event depicted in a series of coloured drawings, yet
there was no constraint on how the participants talked about the event. Thus, this
procedure generates an example of how these family dyads might talk about the sorts of
disciplinary situations that inevitably arise in young children’s lives. However, it is likely
that such conversations are only one aspect of the ways in which conﬂict is actually
treated in families. Real-life conﬂict might be more dominated by emotional reactions.
Constructing a story about another party’s conﬂict might evoke quite different reactions
than responding to a family member who has just provoked you. Thus, we need to be
careful about fully generalizing from a discussion of a conﬂict depicted in a story to how
conﬂict might actually be managed within a given family. That caveat notwithstanding,
when compared to Ruffman et al. (1999), an advantage of our method is that all families
talked about the same event.

From our theoretical perspective, we assume that one aspect of conﬂict likely to be
helpful for children’s social development might be that some parents talk about
particular social situations like the one depicted in our study in ways that direct their
children’s attention to important features of the psychological world, whereas others do
not to the same extent (Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Carpendale et al., 2005; Racine,
2004; Racine & Carpendale, in press; Turnbull, 2003; Turnbull & Carpendale, 1999,
2001). Given this, a training study could be designed that is based on the present
correlation data. A way to do so would be to explain conﬂict situations to randomly
assigned children in either explanatory or non-explanatory terms over a series of time
points and then assess social understanding in comparison with controls.

As well as the role of relationships in social development, a second assumption of our
perspective concerns the relations between language and social development. To
introduce our theory we need to place it in the context of the recent debate about the
role or roles of language in social cognitive development (see also Carpendale & Lewis,
2004). Many approaches share the assumption of a causal psychological view of the
mind according to which mental states casually produce behaviour (Carpendale &
Lewis, 2004; Racine, 2004; Racine & Carpendale,
in press). Following from this
assumption, children are assumed to learn about the mind either through an inferential
process of theory building (e.g. Gopnik & Wellman, 1994), a process of simulation (e.g.
Harris, 1991), or the unfolding of a chieﬂy biological process (e.g. Baron-Cohen, 1995).
We have clearly not designed the present study to pit these theories against one
another in contrast to our own. Indeed, similarly we have not explicitly controlled for a
variety of sources of variance in social understanding. For example, although our sample
is primarily middle class, we did not quantify this and enter it as a variable in our
regressions. Further, although we included the amount of children’s talk in our
regressions, we did not per se have a measure of linguistic ability (e.g. Astington &
Baird, 2005). We also did not take genotypic differences into account (e.g. Hughes et al.,
2005). Nor have we controlled for executive function (e.g. Carlson, Moses, & Claxton,

2004) and thus cannot be sure whether explanatory talk has some broad effect on
cognitive development that is not exclusive to social cognition. These limitations
notwithstanding, it is still not clear that the theoretical differences between the various
accounts of children’s social development can be resolved on strictly empirical grounds
(Racine, 2004; Racine & Carpendale, in press). Although the more familiar social
developmental accounts might be able to account for the ﬁndings of the present study
to a greater or lesser degree, we conducted the present study as a demonstration of a
way of thinking about social development that is not as well represented in the existing
literature.

The present research is based on an alternative view of how children learn about the
mind, wherein children learn about their own minds and the minds of others through
learning the appropriate circumstances that justify the use of words that refer to the
psychological world – i.e. the criteria for the use of such terms (see Carpendale & Lewis,
2004; Racine, 2004; Racine & Carpendale,
in press; Turnbull, 2003; Turnbull &
Carpendale, 1999, 2001). From this point of view, psychological talk is built on to the
prior practices or patterns of human interaction in which the child participates. Talking
with others is important because it is the major way that children are exposed to and
learn the criteria for the use of psychological terms (Carpendale & Lewis, 2004, 2006;
Turnbull, 2003; Turnbull & Carpendale, 1999, 2001).

Harris (1996, 2005) has also argued for the importance of talk and has claimed that
conversation facilitates the development of social understanding because in
conversation a child is constantly reminded that other people may have different
perspectives. On these terms, engaging in conversation would confront children with
the fact that others differ in their perspective and the information they have. We clearly
agree with Harris about the importance of conversation in social development.
However, it seems that Harris conceives of conversation as primarily a means for the
transmission of information. Although aspects of our results are consistent with Harris,
we should clarify the differences and similarities between our position and those of
Harris.

First, we point out that conversation has many functions, only one of which is
exchanging information (see, for example, Turnbull, 2003). More centrally, a way in
which our approach differs from that of Harris is that we emphasize that conversations
differ in the extent to which they facilitate mutual understanding, and, thus, the extent
to which they facilitate social development
(Piaget, 1932/1965, 1945/1962,
1977/1995). In the present study, all the dyads were engaged in conversation, yet our
ﬁndings suggest a role for different
types of conversation in facilitating social
development. Finally, we argued earlier that mental states are learned about in
linguistically referenced patterns of activity, whereas Harris (1991) has argued that
children learn about minds through a process of introspection and simulation (but see
Racine, 2004; Racine & Carpendale, in press).

In this article, we have suggested a theoretical basis for an important set of ﬁndings
regarding the relation between the nature of parent–child interaction and children’s
social development (Hughes et al., 1999; Pears & Moses, 2003; Ruffman et al., 1999;
Vinden, 2001). We have reported evidence consistent with this position that replicates
and extends the work of Ruffman and colleagues (1999) in particular. Our position is
that understanding particular social situations is critical for developing a mature
understanding of mind. If this is true, it follows that children’s social understanding
should be facilitated by interaction that directs their attention to important aspects of
the psychological world.
