Two different models have been proposed that describe the bully alternatively as a child lacking in social skills [Crick and Dodge,
1994], or as a cold manipulative individual, who leads gangs to achieve personal goals [Sutton et al., 1999a]. The present study
examined the performance of 204 8–11-year-olds in a set of stories that assessed understanding of cognitions and emotions, in
relation to their Participant Role in bullying. Moreover, children’s understanding of moral emotions and proneness to moral
disengagement was assessed. Victims showed some difﬁculties in the social cognition task, whereas bullies did not. Aggressive
children, instead, were found to be more ready to show moral disengagement mechanisms, whereas defenders showed higher levels
of moral sensibility. Results are discussed in relation to the two models, and the need for further research into empathy and moral
cognition of children involved in bullying episodes is highlighted. Aggr. Behav. 32:528–539, 2006. r 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION

Over the last 20 years, the literature about the
development of aggressive behavior showed an
increasing interest in the study of the relations
between cognition, social
information processing
and social interaction in children and adolescents
[e.g., Crick and Dodge, 1994; Harvey et al., 2001]. In
particular, several authors studied how the social
information processing strategies used by children
and the way in which they interpret situational cues
and use their previous experiences can inﬂuence
their aggressive conduct [Dodge and Price, 1994;
Huesmann and Guerra, 1997; Randall, 1997]. One
of the most important results of this ﬁeld of research
has been the possibility to identify the presence of
speciﬁc deﬁcits and systematic biases
in some
components of the social cognition of aggressive
children. These results led Dodge and colleagues to
formulate the ‘‘Social Skills Deﬁcit’’ model [Crick
and Dodge, 1994; Dodge, 1980]. According to the
ﬁrst formulation of this model, in which reactive and
proactive categories of aggression were not clearly
distinguished, aggressive children show some difﬁ-
culties in one or more phases of
their social
information processing. For example, these authors
found that aggressive children tend to interpret
ambiguous situations in an aggressive way more

r 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

than their non-aggressive peers (hostile attributional
bias) [Dodge and Frame, 1982; Dodge and Som-
berg, 1987]. Another difference between aggressive
and non-aggressive children refers to the selection of
the behavioral response in a social situation: the
former, in fact, seem to have a more limited range of
non-aggressive answers than the latter and, for this
reason,
they are more inclined to choose and
perform aggressive behaviors, especially in the case
of interpersonal conﬂicts [Dodge, 1980; Dodge and
Newman, 1981; Dodge et al., 1990]. According to
the same approach, victims, who are shy and
withdrawn and lack social skills of assertiveness,
show high levels of anxiety and loneliness, and have
less experience in social interaction and play ﬁghting
(which may enhance social skills), as well as control
and interpretation of emotional expression [Hodges
et al., 1997; Smith et al., 1993].

Some authors tried to apply this model to a
particular kind of aggressive phenomenon: school

bullying [Boulton and Smith, 1994; Slee, 1993; Smith
et al., 1993]. However, despite the popular view of
the bully as an ‘‘oaf’’ boy, that is, an intellectually
simple or backward boy [Besag, 1989], very few
studies conﬁrmed that Dodge’s model can be
applied to bullies in exactly the same way as to
aggressive children [e.g., Hazler, 1996; Randall,
1997]. On the contrary, some other authors stressed
the role of adaptive motivation to explain bullying
behavior, arguing that bullying may be seen as an
inappropriate way to reach a socially effective goal,
such as leadership within a group. As a consequence,
these authors stated that
the bully should not
necessarily be seen as an individual with speciﬁc
difﬁculties. On the contrary, he or she may some-
times be a skilled individual who takes advantage
of his/her high social cognitive competence to reach
personal beneﬁts,
interpersonal domi-
nance, through a ‘‘Machiavellian’’ conduct [Sutton
et al., 1999a].

such as

Some data presented by Sutton et al.

[1999b]
empirically support this view; in fact, they found
that 7–10-year-old bullies performed better than
other classmates in a social cognition task that
required the understanding of mental states and
emotions of the main character of a story (theory of
mind task). The relevance of these results, above all,
lies in the fact that, in a bullying situation, ‘‘having a
grasp of the mental states of those involved, along
with an ability to manipulate these thoughts and
beliefs, may be crucial for the bully in developing
and maintaining such inter-role relations’’ [Sutton
et al., 1999b, p. 437]. In previous studies, therefore,
bullies’ social cognitive skills, such as social per-
spective taking and decoding of emotional informa-
tion, may have been underestimated [Sutton et al.,
1999a,b,c]. However, some bullies may possess a
different conception of the costs and beneﬁts of
aggression, and they may lack in empathic under-
standing of
it
appears more adequate to regard social skills as a
neutral
tool, which may be used for both
prosocial and antisocial purposes [Bjo¨ rkqvist et al.,
2000; Hawley, 2003]. From this perspective, the
crucial point to understand bullying behavior refers
to the kind of values that guide bullies’ conduct,
rather than their higher or lower ability in social
information processing [Arsenio and Lemerise, 2001].
Following this line of research, the present paper
focuses on cognitive and emotional understanding
of social situations in bullying, using a theory of
mind task with children who assume different
participant roles during a bullying episode. In the

[1999b] did not explicitly consider a particular kind
of emotion found to be important to account for
aggressive and antisocial behaviors: moral emotions
(in particular, guilt and shame). If bullies are cold,
manipulative experts in social contexts, their beha-
vior may be related to emotions surrounding moral
transgression. These emotions are important be-
cause, as Hoffman [1976, 2000] pointed out, they are
closely connected with empathy and they can be
considered mediators of conscience. Other authors
suggested that moral development plays a major role
in behavioral regulation [Arsenio, 1988; Nucci,
2001; Smetana, 1995; Turiel, 1998] and that guilt is
an interpersonal phenomenon aimed at avoiding the
disruption of relationships and bonds [Baumeister
et al., 1994; Tagney, 1992]. Moreover, individuals
who are more prone to guilt are less aggressive and
less likely to act out behaviors [Harpur et al., 1988;
Quiles and Bybee, 1997]. In contrast, if children had
lower feelings of guilt, this could ‘‘enable’’ them to
act aggressively without feeling guilty. However, the
reverse causal link could be true, in that children
who repeatedly commit acts of aggression may
become inured to this type of behavior, exhibiting
dulled emotional responses.

Moral Disengagement
and Aggressive Behavior

A useful contribution to the analysis of some
social cognitive components of aggressive behavior
is made by the Social Cognitive Theory of the Moral
Self [Bandura, 1986, 1990, 1991]. According to this
theory, moral reasoning is linked to moral action
through affective self-regulatory mechanisms by
which moral agency is exercised. In their develop-
ment, children need to develop standards of right
and wrong and to adopt these standards as guides
and deterrents for their conduct. This self-regulatory
process implies that individuals usually act in ways
that give them satisfaction and a sense of self-worth,
whereas, on the other side, they tend to avoid
behaviors that violate their moral standards in order
to avoid self-condemnation.

Moreover, Bandura [2002] claimed that the con-
struct of moral disengagement could be considered
as a mediator between the individual’s moral
principles and his/her real conduct, which may not
necessarily be coherent with those principles. Inter-
nal controls,
in fact, are not ﬁxed, and several
psychological and social processes can contribute
to their selective deactivation. In particular, Ban-
dura described eight different mechanisms through
which moral control can be disengaged. One set of

Aggr. Behav. DOI 10.1002/ab

530 Gini

disengagement practices operates on the reconstruc-
tion of the behavior itself. For example, an immoral
conduct is made personally and socially acceptable
by portraying it in the service of moral purposes
(moral
justiﬁcation) or self-deplored acts can be
made to appear righteous by contrasting them with
worse conducts (advantageous comparison). More-
over, in some circumstances, activities can take on
different appearances depending on what they are
called (euphemistic labeling). The second set of
disengagement practices operates by obscuring or
minimizing the agentive role in the harm one causes
(displacement of
responsibility and diffusion of
responsibility). Other ways of weakening moral
control operate by minimizing, disregarding or
distorting the effects of one’s action; if minimization
does not work,
the evidence of harm can be
discredited (minimizing or misconstruing conse-
quences). Finally, disengagement practices may
operate on the recipients of detrimental acts by
stripping them of human qualities (dehumanization)
or considering aggression as provoked by the victim
(attribution of blame). These mechanisms can lead
to aggressive behaviors through a process of moral
disengagement, that is, a partial gap between the
‘‘abstract’’ personal
idea of moral behavior and
the individual’s behavior in real life. In this way, the
individual protects him/herself from negative feel-
ings, such as guilt or shame, that usually follow an
immoral conduct [Bandura, 1991].

showed a positive relation
between aggressive behavior and the activation of
one or more of these mechanisms in both adults and
children [Bandura et al., 1996; Caprara et al., 1995,
1996; Yadava et al., 2001]. In particular, Caprara
et al. [1995] conﬁrmed the strong link between moral
disengagement and physical and verbal aggression,
both self- and peer-evaluated, especially in male
children. More recently, Bandura et al. [2001] have
replicated these results. They found a positive
relation between moral disengagement and trans-
gressive behavior, and a negative relation between
moral disengagement and self-regulatory efﬁcacy
and prosocial behavior.

The above-mentioned studies actually referred to
aggressive individuals, but a similar pattern of data
has been found in school bullying research, as well.
Bacchini et al. [1998] and Menesini et al. [1997],
for example, found that male bullies utilized the
moral disengagement mechanisms more
than
did other peers and, most of all, they seemed to
use the mechanisms of Dehumanization and Moral
Justiﬁcation. A conﬁrmation of
results
emerged in a cross-national study, involving Italy

and Spain, conduced by Menesini et al. [2003b], who
assessed moral reasoning of bullies, victims and
children who assumed the role of the defender, using
the Scan Bullying test [Almeida et al., 2001]. These
authors conﬁrmed the tendency of bullies to show
higher levels of moral disengagement, and the
presence of a proﬁle of egocentric reasoning in
these pupils.

conﬁrmation of the importance of peer ecology

from
several observational studies carried out during
periods of

unstructured contexts, such as during recess and
outdoor play. These studies,
in fact, consistently
found that peers are involved in 85% of bullying
episodes [Atlas and Pepler, 1998; Craig and Pepler,

by Salmivalli et al. [1997] has also revealed a strong
inﬂuence of how the members of a group behave in
bullying situations on an individual child’s behavior
in such situations.

roles

In line with this approach that considers bullying
as a group phenomenon, all distinct roles within the
class were considered in the present study. Not only
bullies and victims participated, but also those
pupils who, in different ways, act important roles
in reinforcing bullying behavior
(the so-called
‘‘Followers’’: the Assistants of the bully and the
Reinforcers) or, in contrast, intervene to defend the
victim (the Defenders). Finally, Outsiders, that is,
children not directly involved in the phenomenon,
were considered.

Aims of the Study and Hypotheses

The ﬁrst aim of the present study was to assess the
performance of these pupils in a social cognition
task similar to the one used by Sutton et al. [1999b].
In this task, the same two typologies of stories used
by Sutton and colleagues were used: cognitive and
emotion stories. The cognitive stories, in particular,
assessed the child’s ability to understand mental
states, beliefs and intentions of the character of the
story. The emotion stories,
instead, assessed the

states of

ability to understand emotional
the
character and the possibility that an emotion could
be dissimulated to inﬂuence and modify others’
knowledge. Contrary to the idea of the bully as a
social ‘‘oaf’’, it is hypothesized that the Bully group
will perform better than, or at least at the same level
as, other pupils in a theory of mind task that
requires understanding the thoughts, beliefs, inten-
tions that guide others’ behavior.

social

Moreover,

in addition to these two kinds of
stories, a third category (moral stories), not used
by Sutton et al. [1999b], was designed in order to
explore the role of moral emotions in the context of
aggressive conduct. The second aim of the present
study,
therefore, was to analyze the ability to
understand moral emotions (guilt and shame) within
hypothetical
scenarios by children who
assume different roles. Considering the literature
about moral cognition in aggressive behavior [e.g.,
Hoffman, 2000; Quiles and Bybee, 1997; Tagney,
1992], it was expected that Bullies would perform
worse than non-aggressive mates in moral stories,
that is, be less likely to make the correct attribution
of moral emotions to the character of the story
owing to his/her negative behavior. In contrast,
Defenders should be particularly sensitive to this
kind of emotion as an expression of what is right
and what is wrong and, therefore, we expected this
group of children to perform better than any other
in this type of stories.

Finally, the third aim of the study was to consider
the relation between moral disengagement and
bullying behavior
[e.g., Caprara et al., 1995;
Menesini et al., 1999]. The comparison among
pupils who assume different roles may lead to a
deeper understanding of the importance of these
mechanisms in bullying episodes. Speciﬁcally, we
expected that
the tendency to activate moral
disengagement mechanisms would be higher in
aggressive children (the Bullies and their Followers).
In contrast, we hypothesized that Victims and those
children who frequently intervene to defend their
victimized classmates (Defenders) would show a
higher moral sensibility and, consequently, a lower
level of moral disengagement.

METHOD

Participants

The initial sample comprised 581 Italian primary-
school children (295 boys and 286 girls) aged
between 8 and 11 years (mean age 5 9.7 years,
s.d. 5 11 months). Although socio-economic status
was not directly measured, our sample included
students from a wide range of social backgrounds
(low and working classes through upper middle
class). In terms of racial/ethnic background, the
sample was predominantly Caucasian (96%), with a
small proportion of Asian (2%) and North African
(2%) origin. All children received school and
parental permission to participate prior to the
collection of the data.

On the basis of peer nominations, children were
ﬁrst assigned to one of the following Role groups:
Bully, Assistant, Reinforcer, Defender, Outsider and
Victim, based on the procedure described below.
Seventy-three children did not receive a speciﬁc role
because they did not satisfy the classiﬁcation criteria
proposed by Salmivalli et al. [1996] and were not
included in the ﬁnal sample. The distribution of
Participant Roles for the whole sample is reported
in Table I.

As can be seen in Table I, cell sizes are rather
unequal for both Participant Roles and gender. In
order to handle problems connected with strongly
unbalanced factorial designs [Cramer, 1998], espe-
cially with small cell numbers, we decided to balance
our Role groups for number and gender. Therefore,
a total of 204 children, divided into six Role groups
(n 5 34; 17 males and 17 females for each one), were
randomly selected and participated in the second
phase of the study. The analyses presented in the
result section have been conducted on this sample
with equalized groups.

collect peer nominations. Children were asked to
nominate up to ﬁve boys and/or girls in their class
who ﬁtted each of the 21 behavioral descriptions of
bullying situations that compose the questionnaire.
In the present study, self-nominations were not
considered. The items are divided into six scales,
which refer to six different Participant Roles: Bully
(4 items, e.g.: ‘‘Starts bullying’’), Assistant (2 items,
e.g.: ‘‘Helps the bully, maybe by catching or holding
the victim’’), Reinforcer (5 items, e.g.:
‘‘Laughs
at people getting bullied’’), Defender (5 items, e.g.:
‘‘Stick up for the victim’’), Outsider (4 items, e.g.:
‘‘Isn’t usually there,
stays away’’) and Victim
(1 item, ‘‘Gets bullied’’). Menesini and Gini [2000]
reported a good internal reliability of these scales
for the Italian population (a 5 .78–.94). In Table II,
correlations between different
scores are
reported.

role

Roles1 were assigned according to the original

procedure, proposed by Salmivalli et al. [1996]:

* for each child a Role Score is calculated in each of
the six scales of the questionnaire. A nomination
for ‘‘sometimes’’ showing a behavior is scored as
1, and ‘‘often’’
the
nominations are summed, divided by the number
of nominators and multiplied by 100;

scored as 2. Then,

* a Participant Role is assigned on the basis of the
child’s highest standardized role score. No role is
assigned if the child’s score is below the mean
(Zo0) in all the six scales, or if the difference
between the two highest scores is less than .1.

Social cognition task: the stories. A set of 15
short stories was designed to test children’s under-
standing of mental states and emotions. Some of
these stories were translated from Happe´ [1994] and
Sutton et al. [1999b], and additional stories were
created reﬂecting the same structure of the pre-
existent stories. Even though some stories (e.g., the
‘‘army/war’’ story) are less relevant for children than
others, they all seemed to be understandable and
valid for primary school pupils.

The 15 stories were divided into three categories,

ﬁve stories for each category:

(a) Cognitive stories: these stories require the under-
standing of mental states,
thoughts, beliefs,
intentions of characters, which determine their
behavior. Example of cognitive story [Happe´ ,
1994]:

During the war,
the Red army captures a
member of the Blue army. They want him to
tell them where his army’s tanks are; they know
they are either by the sea or in the mountains.
They know that the prisoner will not want to
tell them, he will want to save his army, and so
he will certainly lie to them. The prisoner is very
brave and very clever, he will not let them ﬁnd
his tanks. The tanks are really in the mountains.
Now when the other side ask him where his
tanks are, he says, ‘‘They are in the mountains’’;

(b) Emotion stories: in these stories the understand-
ing of what kind of emotion is appropriate
within a speciﬁc situation is crucial. Moreover,
the child needs to understand that emotions can
be clearly shown or, on the contrary, dissimu-
lated, to inﬂuence and modify others’ knowl-
edge. In order to facilitate participants’ answers,
children were presented with drawings of faces
representing different emotions (happiness, sad-
ness, anger, guilt and a neutral
face). An
example of an emotion story taken from Sutton
et al. [1999b] is:

Mike wants to go out with his friends, but he has
a really bad tummy ache. He knows that if his
Mum notices he is ill, she won’t let him go out to
play. Mike goes downstairs and asks his Mum,
‘‘Can I go out to play please?’’;

1An important point raised by a reviewer refers to the possibility to
consider the bully–victim group. However, in our sample, only eight
children scored above the cutting point for both bullies and victims
(equally distributed in the bully and the victim group), which was not
enough for separate analyses. Therefore, we decided not to include
these subjects in our analyses.

(c) Moral stories: in these stories the appropriate
emotion is a moral emotion because some
wrongdoing has happened.
In these stories
children were also helped with the drawings.
An example of moral story (new) is as follows:

Aggr. Behav. DOI 10.1002/ab

Claudia has just moved to her new school. She has
brown hair, green eyes and she is a little bit shorter
than her classmates. During the maths class,
without being noticed by her teacher, Susan,
who sits behind Claudia, sends her a written note
like ‘‘Pigmy, dwarf’’. Claudia reads this note and
starts crying in front of all her mates.

Each story was followed by a control question
based on the content of the story to verify that the
child understood it; then, an experimental question
assessing the understanding of mental states or
emotions was asked. For the cognitive stories, an
answer was considered correct if the child referred to
the mental state, thoughts or beliefs of the char-
acters (e.g., critical question: ‘‘Where will the Red
army look for the Blue army and why?’’; answer:
‘‘They will look by the sea because they think that
the prisoner is lying to them’’). For the emotion
stories, a correct answer included both the identiﬁ-
cation of
the appropriate emotion (positive or
negative) and the reference to the intention/wish of
the main character to hide his/her own real emotion
to the other characters,
for example, when a
character is ‘‘sad’’ but he or she appears ‘‘happy’’
(e.g., ‘‘Mike has a bad tummy ache, but he appears
happy, otherwise his Mum notices that he is feeling
bad and won’t let him go out’’). Finally, for the
moral stories, an answer was considered correct if
the child recognized the fact that, in the situation
described, the character of the story should have
felt a moral emotion (guilt or shame) for his/her
own behavior (e.g., ‘‘She (Susan) feels guilty because
she
to her
mate Claudia’’).

Moral Disengagement Scale. This scale mea-
sures the individual’s tendency to use cognitive
mechanisms that can disengage self-sanctions and
justify the use of violent and aggressive behaviors.
This version of the scale [Caprara et al., 1995],
designed for primary-school children, consists of 14
items describing individual’s readiness to construe
injurious conduct as serving righteous purposes,
masquerading censurable activities by palliative
language or rendering them benign by advantageous
comparison, minimizing the harmful effects of one’s
detrimental conduct and devaluing those who are
maltreated (example items: ‘‘Some kids deserve to be
treated like animals’’; ‘‘Kids cannot be blamed for
misbehaving if their friends pressured them to do
it’’). Children were asked to rate the strength of their
endorsement or rejection of moral exoneration of
detrimental conduct on a 5-point Likert-type scale
(from 1 5 strongly disagree to 5 5 strongly agree).

Social Cognition in Bullying

Therefore, higher scores in this scale indicate a
higher tendency to engage in one or more of these
mechanisms. Even though the items of the scale
describe different mechanisms, previous
studies
using this scale with Italian samples [Caprara
et al., 1995, 1996; Menesini et al., 1997] have
demonstrated a unidimensional structure of
the
scale, especially for younger children. This was also
conﬁrmed in our sample. Therefore, following the
suggestions of the authors of the scale, analyses were
conducted on the total score and not on separate
subscales in the present study. The reliability of the
scale was a 5 .69.

Procedure

Stage 1: The PRQ and the Moral Disengagement
Scale were completed during a single classroom
session and the order of presentation of the two
measures was counterbalanced. This session began
by introducing the general purpose of the study.
Then, the following deﬁnition of bullying [Whitney
and Smith, 1993] was presented and discussed with
the class:

We say a child or young person is being bullied, or
picked on when another child or young person, or
a group of children or young people, say nasty and
unpleasant things to him or her. It is also bullying
when a child or young person is hit, kicked,
threatened, locked inside a room, sent nasty notes,
when no one ever talks to them and things like that.
These things can happen frequently and it is difﬁcult
for the child or young person being bullied to defend
himself or herself. It is also bullying when a child or
young person is teased repeatedly in a nasty way.
But it is not bullying when two children or young
people of about the same strength have the odd ﬁght
or quarrel.

Stage 2: When the data from Stage 1 had been
analyzed, children selected through the PRQ were
tested individually in an area of the school that
afforded privacy. During this session, the stories
were presented in a randomized order and the
children’s answers were audio-recorded to facilitate
the successive transcription and coding procedure.
In order to avoid any possible inﬂuence upon their
responses, the experimenter who interviewed chil-
dren did not know their Participant role.

means in social cognition and moral disengagement
with independent 6 (Roles)  2 (Gender) ANOVAs.
The continuous measure ‘‘Role Scores’’ is used to
test for correlations between the extent of different
types of behavior in the whole sample and the social
cognition and moral disengagement measures.

Preliminary Analysis

A preliminary one-way ANOVA was performed
to investigate the possible effect of Participant Roles
on the answers
to the control questions. No
statistically signiﬁcant differences emerged among
the different roles [F(5, 192) 5 .962, P 5 n.s.], thus
conﬁrming that
the level of comprehension of
the stories presented was similar for all Participant
Roles.

Moreover,

in order to control

for inter-rater
reliability, two independent judges coded the 30%
of all children’s answers. Their level of agreement
reached 96%. Cohen’s kappa was also calculated,
resulting in K 5 .91. Disagreements were due to
those answers in which the reference to mental states

resolved by consultation between the coders.

Participant Roles and Social Cognition

As the three categories into which our stories were
divided (cognitive, emotion and moral stories) are
different from each other, three separate ANOVAs
were conducted on the mean performance in the
three sets of stories, with Role and Gender as
between factors. From the analysis, a statistically
signiﬁcant main effect of Role emerged only for the

Role Scores and Social Cognition

A partial correlation analysis between social
cognition and the actual extent of different types
of behavior
(the role scores) was performed.
Considering the fact that the scales are correlated
with each other, to examine the relation of each role
with the cognitive, emotion and moral information
processing skills,
in the correlation analysis the
remaining PRQ scales and age were partialled out.
Moreover, considering the high number of compar-
isons, in order to avoid the increase of type 1 error,
Bonferroni’s correction was used (adjusted level of
a: .05/24 5 .002). Correlation coefﬁcients are shown
in Table IV. In line with Hypothesis 1, Bully role is
positively correlated with the total social cognition
score and with the cognitive score (the ability
to understand thoughts,
intentions, beliefs, etc.)
and the emotion score. Moreover,
in accordance
with Hypothesis 2, the Defender score is positively
correlated with all social cognition scores.

Participant Roles and Moral Disengagement

As concerns the third aim, a two-way ANOVA on
the mean score in the Moral Disengagement Scale
was performed with Role and Gender as between
factors. A statistically signiﬁcant main effect of Role

DISCUSSION

Social Cognition in Bullying

The present study is located in research about the
role of social cognition in the development of
bullying behavior among schoolmates. In particular,
two different models have been proposed in the
literature to explain the Bully’s behavior in terms
of social information processing. The ﬁrst model
hypothesizes the presence of deﬁcits in the social
information processing of bullies, similar to those
found for aggressive children [Crick and Dodge,
1994; Dodge, 1980]. This model, therefore, proposes
the idea of bullies as ‘‘oaf’’ children. They are
considered deﬁcient in their social intelligence, that
is their ability to interpret and manage information
deriving from social interactions with peers and to
produce adequate social responses. The second
in contrast, states that bullies are quite
model,
skilful
in understanding social cues (e.g., others’
mental states) and that they exploit this ability
to their own advantage, acting as ‘‘skilled social
manipulators’’
[Sutton et al., 1999a,b]. However,
according to these authors, bullies may lack the
empathic reactivity towards their mates’ emotions
and, in particular, towards victim’s suffering.

they may be deﬁcient

In the ﬁrst two hypotheses of the present study, it
was anticipated that bullies may have a good theory
of mind, but
in moral
cognition. The analysis of variance, indeed, indi-
cated that
the bully group did not show any
difﬁculty, compared to non-aggressive peers, in the
understanding of cognitive stories, which required
them to assume the cognitive point of view of
another person, that is to understand intentions,
beliefs and goals that guide a determinate behavior.
Moreover, correlations between the scores in each
scale of the PRQ and the performance in the social
cognition task indicated a positive relation between
bullying behavior and the ability to understand
others’ mental states. As regards the two models,
therefore, our results are closer to what would be
expected by the Skilled Manipulator model [Sutton
et al., 1999a]. The fact that our bullies did not show
particular deﬁcits in this speciﬁc area of social
cognition does not suggest a direct application of the
Social Skills Deﬁcit model [Crick and Dodge, 1994]
to bullying behavior. Further analyses are needed
into the social cognitive competence of children
involved in bullying episodes. This is particularly
important because theory of mind explanations per
se are not likely to be very helpful for understanding
the unique nature of bullying,
in that having a
sophisticated theory of mind can lead to highly

prosocial behavior or to bullying behavior. In other
words, having a ‘‘superior’’ theory of mind says
nothing about how that knowledge will be utilized in
social interactions [Arsenio and Lemerise, 2001].

signiﬁcantly lower,

As regards the two other types of stories used in
the present study, bullies’ performance in emotion
stories and also in moral stories, a category not used
by Sutton et al. [1999b], was found to be slightly, but
not
than the performance
obtained by other groups. Contrary to our second
hypothesis about the possible difﬁculties of bullies in
moral cognition, our results do not completely
conﬁrm the literature on moral development in
aggressive children and bullies [e.g., Bandura, 1991;
Hart et al., 2003]. In our sample, in fact, the bullies
and their followers did not show a signiﬁcant lack of
ability in the attribution of appropriate moral emo-
tions to the characters of the stories. These emotions,
such as guilt and shame, play an important role in the
recognition of the damage suffered by another person
and are closely connected to the sense of responsi-
bility of the person who shows the harmful behavior.
Moreover, these emotions imply the need of repara-
tion as a consequence of a negative outcome
produced by one’s behavior [Bybee, 1998; Hoffman,
2000].

comprehension of others’

However, for both emotion and moral stories, it is
important to note that they actually assess the
‘‘cognitive’’ ability to process emotional information
in social interactions rather than an ‘‘emotional’’ or
‘‘empathic’’
feelings.
Therefore,
the positive performance shown by
aggressive children in these kinds of stories may
misrepresent or underestimate the real deﬁcit of
these children in emotional understanding of others.
In other words, what bullies may lack and what may
differentiate them from prosocial children is the
ability to appreciate the emotional consequences
of their behaviors on others’ feelings, and to share
in, and empathize with,
the feelings of others
[Arsenio and Lemerise, 2001; Eisenberg and Fabes,
1998]. In line with this perspective, for example, Gini
et al.
[2004] recently found a negative relation
between bullying behavior and empathy, measured
through Davis’ empathic reactivity index [1983], in a
sample of Italian adolescents.

Sutton et al. [1999a] also argued along these lines,
referring to the ‘‘cold cognition’’ hypothesis pro-
posed by Mealey [1995] as regards sociopathy. They
also spoke of a theory of mind formulated purely in
instrumental terms, without access to the empathic
understanding that most people rely on. As a
consequence,
the individual may use aggressive
behavior in a Machiavellian way, without consider-

Aggr. Behav. DOI 10.1002/ab

ing its negative consequences on others. In contrast,
high levels of empathic responsiveness act as an im-
portant mediator in social conduct, reducing aggres-
sion and favoring prosocial behavior [Bjo¨ rkqvist
et al., 2000; Kaukiainen et al., 1994, 1996].

With respect to the other groups considered in the
present study, victimized children showed some
difﬁculties in the social cognition task. If compared
to the defender group in particular, they seem to
lack the ability to understand others’ mind, that is
their thoughts, beliefs and intentions that guide
social behavior. Our data are consistent with results
reported by Sutton et al. [1999b]. Moreover, several
authors share the idea that victims show deﬁcits in
areas like social skills, social problem solving,
assertiveness and emotional regulation [e.g., Cham-
pion et al., 2003; Kochenderfer and Ladd, 1997;
Mahady-Wilton et al., 2000; Olweus, 1993; Perry
et al., 1988]. Finally, the results obtained in the
social cognition task by the defender group should
be noted. These children, in fact, showed high levels
of performance in all the stories, and especially in
the cognitive stories. Moreover, the score in the
defender scale of the PRQ correlated positively with
all the scores in the social cognition task, thus
suggesting that
this kind of
prosocial and helpful behavior requires a high level
of social ability and a well-developed understanding
of both cognitive and emotional states of others.
However, the fact that the bullying score also cor-
related with the social cognition task, again, con-
ﬁrms that having a good theory of mind, by itself,
does not necessarily mean that this ability will be
used to act prosocially [Arsenio and Lemerise, 2001].

the aggressive roles and,

As regards the third aim of the present study, the
analysis of variance on moral disengagement
showed higher levels of the tendency to disengage
self-sanctions and justify the use of aggressive
behaviors
in
particular, in bullies. These results conﬁrmed the
role of speciﬁc cognitive mechanisms in the regula-
tion of social conduct, such as the moral disengage-
ment mechanisms that allow the assumption of
violent behaviors [Bacchini et al., 1998; Caprara
et al., 1995; Menesini et al., 1999, 2003a,b].
Regarding this aspect, as suggested by a reviewer,
it could be interesting to collect information about
the relations between bullying, familial socialization
and moral climate at home and at school.

In contrast, defenders’ high moral sensibility and
empathic reactivity, already found in other studies

[Gini and Carli, 2003; Menesini et al., 2003a,b], may
be one of
the basic motivations for prosocial
behavior, frequently shown by these children to-
wards their victimized mates. These motivations are
very important and must be taken into account
in the implementation of intervention programs in
schools [Cowie, 2000; Cowie et al., 2002]. However,
the fact that the ability to help other peers requires
several
that young
children do not necessarily possess needs to be
considered.

In conclusion, the results presented in this paper
have several potential
implications for future re-
search. On the one hand, our results draw attention
to the importance of studying the role of social
cognitive competencies in the complex circle of
behaviors, attitudes and expectations upon which
school bullying phenomenon is based. On the other
hand, the relevance of adopting a more ﬁne-grained
classiﬁcation of roles in the study of bullying
behavior was conﬁrmed.

is,

that

A possible limitation in the interpretation of our
results was the fact that we did not consider the
bully-victim group,
those children who
frequently assume both kinds of role, acting as a
bully and being victimized as well [e.g., Boulton and
Smith, 1994; Olweus, 1993]. Several authors stressed
the relevance of this group of pupils, also called
aggressive victims [Perry et al., 1988; Schwartz,
2000], in the study of aggressive problems. More-
over, these children have been consistently described
as lacking social-emotional abilities, having psycho-
social
impairments and a wide range of other
problems [e.g., Besag, 1989]. A methodological
difﬁculty in the study of these pupils is that it is
not always simple to clearly identify bully-victims as
a distinct group. Despite this complication, future
research in this ﬁeld will necessarily need to study
the social cognitive and moral characteristics of this
particular group of children, and to compare their
level of cognitive and emotional understanding with
that of ‘‘pure’’ bullies and victims.
