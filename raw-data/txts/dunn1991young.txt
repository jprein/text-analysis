 Children's Understanding of Other People's Feelings and Beliefs: Individual Differences and
 Their Antecedents. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1991, 62, 1352-1366. Individual differences in young
 children's understanding of others' feelings and in their ability to explain human action in terms
 of beliefs, and the earlier correlates of these differences, were studied with 50 children observed
 at home with mother and sibling at 33 months, then tested at 40 months on affective-labeling,
 perspective-taking, and false-belief tasks. Individual differences in social understanding were
 marked; a third of the children offered explanations of actions in terms of false belief, though
 few predicted actions on the basis of beliefs. These differences were associated with participation
 in family discourse about feelings and causality 7 months earlier, verbal fluency of mother and
 child, and cooperative interaction with the sibling. Differences in understanding feelings were
 also associated with the discourse measures, the quality of mother-sibling interaction, SES, and
 gender, with girls more successful than boys. The results support the view that discourse about
 the social world may in part mediate the key conceptual advances reflected in the social cognition
 tasks; interaction between child and sibling and the relationships between other family members
 are also implicated in the growth of social understanding.

 The very early stages of children's un-
 derstanding of other minds and others' feel-
 ings have in the last few years received rap-
 idly growing attention (Astington, Harris, &
 Olson, 1988; Frye & Moore, 1990; Whiten,
 1990); particular interest has been shown in
 the question of when young children are
 aware of mental states and of the psychologi-
 cal causes of behavior (Miller & Aloise,
 1989). Research strategies have included the
 documentation of the recognition and differ-
 entiation of emotions by infants (Harris,
 1989); the development of children's use
 of, first, feeling state terms and, later, men-
 tal terms (Bretherton, McNew, & Beeghly-
 Smith, 1981; Ridgeway, Waters, & Kuczaj,
 1985; Shatz, Wellman, & Silber, 1983); the
 distinctions very young children make be-
 tween the mental and physical worlds in-
 volving knowledge states (Wellman, 1985);
 and their ability to reason about and explain
 human action in terms of beliefs and desires.
 A focus of special interest has been the de-
 velopment of children's ability to predict
 and explain actions that are premised on

 mistaken or false beliefs, in terms of what
 another person thinks or believes (Olson,
 Astington, & Harris, 1988). As Bartsch and
 Wellman (1989) put it, "Understanding ac-
 tions in terms of beliefs and desires is fun-
 damental to understanding people and to
 social action. A central question for devel-
 opmental research, therefore, concerns
 when we are able to participate in this sys-
 tem of reasoning." The issue of interest here
 is not so much children's understanding of
 false belief per se-their grasp of the idea
 that people can believe something that is not
 true-but rather their growing understand-
 ing of how belief or desire influences be-
 havior.

 In this burst of productive research on
 children's "theories of mind," the focus has
 been on describing with cross-sectional
 studies the ages at which particular abilities
 are manifest and on delineating the nature
 of the limitations and problems children
 have in conceiving of others' mental states
 and in understanding false beliefs as a basis

 for action. Although there is considerable
 disagreement about the earliest stages of this
 understanding, it is generally agreed that be-
 tween 3 and 5 years children's ability to re-
 flect on other minds and their understanding
 of the psychological bases of human action
 change markedly in nature.

 ing states (Dunn, Brown, & Beardsall, 1991),
 and to cognitive ability (Rothenberg, 1970).

 The relative importance of these various
 potential influences on the development of
 children's emotional understanding remains
 to be established with young children. One
 study reports, for instance, associations be-
 tween frequency of family discourse about
 feeling states in the preschool period and
 children's ability in middle childhood to
 make judgments about emotions in an af-
 fective perspective-taking task (Dunn et al.,
 1991). However, it remains possible that dif-
 ferences between families in such discourse
 are correlated with other differences in fam-
 ily interaction, and no inferences about the
 unique contribution of discourse in the de-
 velopment of understanding are possible un-
 til both discourse and family interaction
 variables are considered together. The pos-
 sible role of such variables in contributing
 to individual differences in children's un-
 derstanding of mental states has not yet been
 examined. It is not known whether such dif-
 ferences are attributable to differences in
 cognitive or verbal ability, or whether inter-
 actional experiences within the family also
 play a role in their development. The issue
 of how far language experiences are related
 to the conceptual development reflected in
 children's growing understanding of "other
 minds" remains to be explored. It is a rea-
 sonable hypothesis that family conversations
 about why people behave the way they do
 may foster the development of children's un-
 derstanding of the connection between oth-
 ers' thoughts and beliefs and their behavior.
 It is also compatible with Wellman's (1988)
 proposal that 3-year-olds' understanding of
 human action is based on an everyday folk
 psychology in which actions are explained
 in terms of the wishes, hopes, beliefs, and
 intentions of the actor. However, such a pos-
 sibility has not yet been tested.

 In this article, such an examination is

 carried out, with data from a longitudinal
 study in which children were first observed
 within their families at 33 months, and then
 tested at 40 months on their understanding
 of others, with two types of assessment. An
 assessment of their understanding of how
 another person's beliefs will affect his or her
 behavior, developed by Bartsch and Well-
 man (1989), was conducted. In this series of
 tasks the focus is specifically on the chil-
 dren's ability to explain the actions taken by
 another when those actions are the conse-
 quence of a belief the child knows to be in-
 correct, and their ability to predict the be-

 Within this research on children's un-

 derstanding of "other minds" there has been
 no consideration, as yet, of individual differ-
 ences in the abilities of children to conceive
 of mental states or in their grasp of the basis
 of people's actions in terms of beliefs. Yet if
 the growth of this ability is such a central
 aspect of human development, the question
 of what influences differences in its devel-
 opmental course is surely important, as is
 the matter of the prognostic significance of
 individual differences in the timing of its
 early appearance. To date, we have no infor-
 mation on either issue. We do not know
 whether differences are related primarily to
 individual differences in, for example, chil-
 dren's verbal intelligence, or to children's
 experience of participation in discussions of
 why people behave as they do, or the quality
 of their family relationships more broadly
 considered.

 In contrast, studies of the recognition
 and understanding of emotions in preschool
 children have included a number of investi-
 gations of individual differences, such as
 studies of individual differences in response
 to distress (Cummings, Hollenbeck, lanotti,
 Radke-Yarrow, & Zahn-Waxler, 1986; Den-
 ham & Couchoud, 1990; Main & George,
 1985), in talk about emotions (Dunn, Breth-
 erton, & Munn, 1987), in comforting (Mur-
 phy, 1937) and hurting (Dunn & Kendrick,
 1982), and in understanding the situational
 causes of another's emotion (Denham, 1986).
 Among the variables thought to influence
 these individual differences, the following
 have been cited: parental socialization tech-
 niques (Denham & Couchoud, 1990), paren-
 tal verbal explanation, discourse about emo-
 tions and moral messages (Dunn et al., 1987;
 Zahn-Waxler, Radke-Yarrow, & King, 1979),
 children's perspective-taking ability (Stew-
 art & Marvin, 1984), and individual differ-
 ences in children's sociability or assertive-
 ness (Murphy, 1937). With children of 5 and
 above, individual differences in emotional
 understanding have been linked to their so-
 ciometric status and social competence with
 peers (Cassidy & Parke, 1990; Gnepp, 1989;
 Rothenberg, 1970), to the emotional expres-
 siveness of their parents (Cassidy & Parke,
 1990), to parent-child discourse about feel-

 havior of another who is in possession of a
 belief that the child knows to be false. An
 assessment of affective perspective-taking
 developed by Denham (1986) was also em-
 ployed: this involves a series of scenarios
 enacted with puppets in which the chil-
 dren's understanding of the situational de-
 terminants of another's feelings is assessed.
 The first goal of the article is to describe

 individual differences in children's under-
 standing of feelings and of how people's ac-
 tions are premised on their beliefs at a stage
 when, according to current work on chil-
 dren's theory of mind, some but not all chil-
 dren are able to reflect on mental states and
 to explain behavior in terms of beliefs.

 exchanges between others (Cummings,
 Zahn-Waxler, & Radke-Yarrow, 1981; Dunn
 & Munn, 1985); they may well, as family
 members, learn from observing the interac-
 tions between others. The relations between
 child and sibling were also included as a
 focus of interest: work on older children
 indicates that differences in emotional un-
 derstanding are related to children's experi-
 ences with peers (e.g., Cassidy & Parke,
 1990). Third, we examined the possibility
 that differences in children's social under-
 standing, as reflected in assessments that de-
 pend on verbal answers, are primarily re-
 lated to differences in verbal ability, in the
 educational and social background of the
 family, or the child's gender.

 The families were visited at home, at

 two time points: when the children were

 The second goal is to examine associa-

 tions between such individual differences in
 understanding others and a number of vari-
 ables from children's family experiences 7
 months earlier. First, we were interested in
 the possibility that differences in children's
 experiences of family discourse about feel-
 ing states, and about the causes of behavior
 and events, might be linked to later indi-
 vidual differences in understanding others'
 feelings and in comprehending the connec-
 tions between beliefs and behavior. As al-
 ready noted, family conversations about
 feelings have been found to relate to later
 affective perspective-taking assessments
 (Dunn et al., 1991). The potential signifi-
 cance of family discourse about causality lies
 in the opportunity that such discourse pro-
 vides for children to enquire, argue, and re-
 flect about why people behave the way that
 they do. Children's participation in conver-
 sation about cause is focused especially on
 psychological causality (Hood & Bloom,
 1979); the hypothesis is examined here that
 differences in such participation in causal
 talk and feeling state talk are associated with
 later differences in understanding of belief
 as the basis for action.

 Second, we considered the possibility
 that differences in the quality of relation-
 ships between different family members
 may be implicated in the development of
 differences in social understanding. Here,
 we wished to examine not only the quality of
 relations between mother and child, widely
 considered to be important in the develop-
 ment of social understanding, but also the
 possibility that the relations between other
 family members (mother to sibling, sibling
 to mother) may also be implicated in the de-
 velopment of social understanding. Chil-
 dren are sensitive observers of the emotional

 The third goal of the paper is to examine
 how much of the variance in these aspects
 of children's social understanding could be
 explained by combinations of these family
 and background variables, and what inde-
 pendent contribution to the variance was
 made by the discourse, relationship, and
 background variables, respectively.

 Method

 SUBJECTS

 The subjects were 50 second-born chil-
 dren, participating with their older siblings
 and their mothers in a longitudinal study
 in central Pennsylvania. There were 23
 boys (13 with older brothers, 10 with older
 sisters) and 27 girls (10 with older sisters
 and 17 with older brothers). The mean age
 gap between the siblings was 43 months
 (range 16-73). The families, recruited from
 sequential birth announcements in the local
 newspaper, included a wide range of back-
 grounds; the occupational status of the fa-
 thers was assessed with the National Opin-
 ion Research Corporation prestige ratings
 based on the 1970 census (Hauser & Feath-
 erman, 1977): the mean paternal prestige rat-
 ing was 51.5 (SD = 16.3), the range from 15
 to 88. For the U.S. white labor force, the
 mean NORC rating is 41.7 (SD = 13.9); thus
 although the Pennsylvania sample has a
 higher occupational prestige rating than the
 working U.S. population, the variance is
 similar. Mean values for parental education
 were 14.7 (SD = 2.4) years and 15.4 (SD =
 2.9) years for mothers and fathers, respec-
 tively.

 Time 1 Observations

 At time 1, two observations, each of 1

 hour 15 min, were carried out 1 week apart.
 The observations were unstructured and
 carried out by a single observer. To reduce
 the intrusive effect of the observer's pres-
 ence, the same observer visited the family
 on each occasion, and did not begin re-
 cording until at least 15 min after her ar-
 rival. We emphasized to the mothers that
 we wished to study "normal" interaction be-
 tween the siblings and to disrupt family pat-
 MEASURES
 terns of interaction as little as possible. The
 mothers continued to carry out their usual
 domestic routine while we were present.
 Family conversation during the observa-
 tion was recorded on a portable audiotape
 recorder, and paper-and-pencil recording
 methods were used (see Dunn & Munn,
 1987, for similar methods). The observer tar-
 geted her observations on the second-born
 child and noted in a lined notebook who was
 present with the child, recording the time
 that different family members entered or left
 the room in which the target child was; a
 narrative record was kept in which details of
 the context and affect of family members
 were noted. Context details included, for
 example, the actions that led to a dispute,
 the details of pretend or cooperative play,
 and nonverbal behavior such as provocative
 physical teasing. Shortly after the observa-
 tion the observer prepared a detailed tran-
 script of the observation, including all family
 talk and the nonverbal record. Following the
 observation, the observer rated each family
 member's behavior toward each other family
 member in a series of rating scales, focusing
 on the mother's responsiveness, attention,
 control, and affection to the child and to
 the sibling, and on the child's and the sib-
 ling's conflict, cooperation, control, compe-
 tition, and attention toward each other (see
 Stocker, Dunn, & Plomin, 1989). The data
 from the observations reported here concern
 children's conversations with their mothers
 and siblings (specifically, their conversa-
 tions concerning feeling states and concern-
 ing causality) and the ratings of family mem-
 bers' interaction. Details of the discourse
 measures used, and these rating scales, are
 given below.

 Time 2 Social Cognition Tasks

 At time 2, two visits were made in which
 the sociocognitive assessments considered
 in this article, the false belief tasks (Bartsch

 Dunn et al. 1355

 & Wellman, 1989), and the affective per-
 spective-taking tasks (Denham, 1986), were
 conducted. On the first visit, the false belief
 tasks were carried out with the children.
 A questionnaire was also administered to
 mothers to decide on appropriate content for
 the affective perspective-taking task for each
 child (see below). On the second visit, the
 affective perspective-taking task was carried
 out; information on the parents' occupations
 and education was obtained from an inter-
 view with the mother. Six observers were
 involved in the data collection.

 Conversational Measures

 The transcripts provided a data base of

 on average 316 child speaker turns, 356
 turns of mother and sibling to the child
 (Table 1). A speaker turn was defined as all
 of one speaker's utterances bounded by the
 utterances of another speaker. The corre-
 lations between the measures on the first
 and second visits at time 1 gave an estimate
 of test-retest reliability for the different
 speaker turns; these were as follows: child
 to mother r(50) = .69, mother to child r(50)
 = .74, child to sibling r(50) = .68, sibling to
 child r(50) = .68, all significant at p < .05.
 Mean Length of Utterance

 The mean length and the upperbound
 mean length of each child's utterances were
 coded following standard procedures (Shatz
 & Gelman, 1973) from the 100 consecutive
 child utterances that followed the child's
 first 10 conversational turns. The number of
 words in the 10 longest of these utterances
 was used to determine the upperbound
 MLU. The mothers' MLU and upperbound
 MLU were similarly calculated. The MLU
 and upperbound MLU were positively cor-
 related for both mothers and children, r(50)
 = .86 and .85, for mothers and for children,
 respectively, both p < .001, and the pattern
 of correlations with these measures and the
 other time 1 measures to be reported was
 very similar. In the analyses that follow we
 therefore report just the results for the up-
 perbound MLU.
 Feeling State Talk

 A coding system was designed for the
 analysis of conversations in which family
 members referred to feeling states (see
 Dunn et al., 1991). References included con-
 versational turns in which the speaker used
 a feeling state term (e.g., "sad" or "happy"),
 those in which the speaker used a phrase
 that connoted a feeling state (e.g., "made a

 fuss"), and those in which an expletive was
 used that connoted a particular feeling state
 (e.g., "Yuck!" [disgust]). Nonspecific exple-
 tives (e.g., "Aha!"), crying, or laughter were
 not included in this coding scheme. State-
 ments of a moral or evaluative nature were
 included only if their content specifically
 denoted or connoted a feeling state on the
 part of the speaker or person referred to (e.g.,
 "That's disgusting!"). The term "like" was
 included only when it referred to a state of
 enjoyment or dislike, not when it indicated
 desire or volition, as in the example "Would
 you like to have this toy?" Terms that pro-
 jected feeling states as attributes onto the
 persons or objects that elicited them (e.g.,
 "scary" or "poor") were included.

 ing state turns) as an index of the child's par-
 ticipation in family talk about feelings; total
 feeling state turns to child (i.e., mother to
 child + sibling to child feeling state turns)
 as an index of the talk directly addressed
 to the target child concerning feelings;
 mother-child total feeling state turns (i.e.,
 mother to child + child to mother feeling
 state turns) as an index of the conversations
 between mother and child about feelings;
 this was included because the previous
 study had found mother-child conversa-
 tional turns about feeling states to be the
 most powerful predictor of later affective
 perspective taking. Frequencies of these
 measures, and of the total turns in the obser-
 vations, are shown in Table 1.
 Talk about Causality

 A conversational turn referring to feel-
 ing states was defined as all of one speaker's
 utterances bounded by the utterances of an-
 other speaker in which an explicit reference
 to a feeling state was made. If an individual's
 utterances within one conversational turn
 referred to more than one emotional theme,
 or to more than one individual's feelings,
 each reference was coded separately. Each
 conversational turn that referred to a feeling
 state was coded in terms of a number of vari-
 ables (speaker, addressee, theme, dispute,
 causal reference, pragmatic context). In the
 present article, we consider the categories of
 speaker and addressee, and employ mea-
 sures of total feeling state turns. In our initial
 examination of the data we employed three
 measures: total child feeling state turns
 (i.e., child to mother + child to sibling feel-

 A second coding system was designed
 for the analysis of conversations about cau-
 sality, in which speaker turns wherein a
 causal relationship was discussed were in-
 cluded. It should be noted that in those anal-
 yses in which both feeling state talk and
 causal talk turns were entered, those speaker
 turns that included both causal and feeling
 state references were entered only once.
 The turn could be related to the causal com-
 ponent of the conversation as either the an-
 tecedent or consequent of the causal refer-
 ence ("You broke my glass [antecedent] and
 that makes me sad" [consequent]). The cri-
 teria used to determine whether a causal in-
 ference was made were based on those de-
 veloped by Hood and Bloom (1979). Causal
 statements by young children and indeed

 the coders' categorization of the total num-

 number of causal turns was .86, both signifi-
 cant at p < .05.

 connectives (see Hood & Bloom, 1979); thus
 turns coded as causal included, in addition
 to those in which an explicit causal term was
 used (e.g., "why" or "because"), turns in
 which a reference was made to two events
 or states that had a conditional relationship
 (e.g., "Don't jump, you'll break that!"). Mea-
 sures of causal talk paralleled those of the
 feeling state talk, and included total child
 causal turns (i.e., child causal turns to
 mother + child causal turns to sibling, ex-
 pressed as percentage of child total turns to
 mother and sibling); total causal turns to
 child (i.e., mother causal turns to child +
 sibling causal turns to child, as percentage
 of total mother and sibling turns to child);
 mother and child total causal turns (i.e.,
 mother to child and child to mother causal
 turns). As with the feeling state coding, if
 more than one causal reference occurred
 within a speaker turn it was coded sepa-
 rately. All discussions of cause were coded;
 it should be noted, however, that as with
 other studies of causal conversations with
 children of this age period (e.g., Hood &
 Bloom, 1979), discussion of psychological/
 behavioral causality predominated.

 Mother's interaction with child and
 with sibling.-Four 5-point scales were
 used: responsiveness, attention, control/in-
 trusiveness, and affection. Taking affection
 as an example, the scale ranged from (1)
 many negative remarks, no physical af-
 fection, more negative than positive re-
 marks, negative tone of voice even if content
 is neutral, through (3) some praise and posi-
 tive comments, some smiles and laughter
 with child, some comments made with warm
 tone of voice, to (5) many positive com-
 ments, many smiles, affectionate physical
 contact, tone of voice very warm and
 friendly, praise, and positive evaluation.

 dominance, competition, and affection. Tak-
 ing cooperation as an example, the scale
 ranged from (1) no attempts to cooperate, no
 innovatory suggestions for joint activity, re-
 fusal to cooperate with other's suggestions,
 ignores other's conversational attempts,
 through (3) follows suggestions, occasional
 tentative attempts at cooperation, shares and

 ment for a naughty act. Each vignette was
 accompanied by vocal and visual affective
 cues emitted by the puppet/observer. In
 eight of these vignettes the puppet felt the
 way most people would feel (e.g., fear dur-
 ing a nightmare; see Borke, 1971); in eight
 the puppet felt the opposite of what the
 mothers had reported in the questionnaire
 administered at the previous visit that their
 child would probably feel. This question-
 naire focused on situations in which chil-
 dren's emotional reactions differ, such as
 arrival at preschool, meeting a big though
 friendly dog, or seeing a parent off on a trip.
 In the second portion of the puppet tasks,
 the puppet in these same situations ex-
 pressed an emotion that was different from
 that which the child (according to her
 mother's report) herself expressed in that sit-
 uation; thus, the task was designed to re-
 quire inference about the puppet who was
 expressing an emotion different from the
 emotion typical for the child in that situa-
 tion, but also within the realm of the child's
 everyday experience. For example, moth-
 ers indicated whether their child would
 be happy or sad to come to day-care and
 whether they would be happy about or fear-
 ful of big dogs, and the puppet then enacted
 the emotion that the child would not express
 in that situation. After each of the vignettes,
 the children were asked "How does the pup-
 pet feel?" and encouraged to fix the relevant
 face on the puppet. Scoring proceeded as in
 the affective labeling task. A total score for
 the 16 vignettes was created (total correct =
 32). As Denham (1986) found, scores on the
 labeling and perspective-taking tasks were
 correlated, r(50) = .69, p < .05. They
 showed very similar patterns of correlations
 with the other time 1 measures, and an af-
 fective aggregate score was therefore cre-
 ated by combining the scores of the two sets
 of tasks (total score = 48). Cronbach's alpha
 for the affective aggregate was .91.
 False Belief Tasks

 The children's understanding of false

 belief was tested in a series of tasks that re-
 quired them to predict how a puppet would
 behave given a false belief, and also to give
 an explanation of a puppet's behavior given
 a false belief (Bartsch & Wellman, 1989).
 The procedures described by Bartsch and
 Wellman (1989) were followed. For each
 task, the child was shown two small closed
 boxes, one marked with a familiar and obvi-
 ous picture (e.g., a Band-Aid box), and the
 other a plain unmarked box of the same size
 and color. At the beginning of the session,

 Interobserver agreement among the six

 individuals who conducted the observations
 was assessed from videotapes of 10 families
 using Finn's r (shown in Table 2). This is an
 appropriate index of reliability when there
 is reduced variance in ratings (Finn, 1970,
 1972; see also Tinsley & Weiss, 1975), which
 takes account of chance agreement and gives
 similar results to the intraclass correlation
 (Finn, 1970, 1972). The videotaped families
 were not part of the main study but were
 from similar backgrounds. Test-retest reli-
 abilities of these scales were assessed by
 comparing the ratings given on visits 1 and
 2 and are shown in Table 2.

 Affective Labeling

 The two procedures reported in Den-
 ham (1986) were followed. First, children
 examined four faces made of felt on which
 the expressions of happy, sad, angry, and
 afraid were drawn. They were then asked to
 identify these expressions, first expressively
 with a verbal label, and then receptively, by
 pointing to the appropriate face when the
 experimenter asked, "Which is the happy/
 sad/angry/afraid face?" They received 2
 points for correct expressive, 2 points for cor-
 rect receptive, and 1 point for expressively
 or receptively identifying positive/negative
 dimensions (e.g., "He feels bad" rather than
 "He feels angry/sad/afraid" would be given
 a 1-point score [total correct = 16]).
 Affective Perspective Taking

 The puppets enacted 16 vignettes cen-
 tered on emotion-inducing situations such as
 having an unexpected visit to the zoo, a new
 bicycle, having a frightening dream, seeing
 a parent off on a trip, being punched by a
 sibling, and being threatened with punish-

 the experimenter told the child, "Pick the
 box that you think has Band-Aids in it." The
 child picked one of the boxes (almost always
 the marked container) and was told to look
 inside it. The marked container was empty.
 The child was then told to look inside the
 other (plain) box, which was full of Band-
 Aids. The purpose of this part of the task
 was to demonstrate that the marked box was
 empty and the unmarked box was full. Both
 boxes were then closed.

 diction and five explanation tasks. The
 presentation of tasks was counterbalanced:
 Prediction and explanation questions were
 presented in an alternating format for each
 child, and half the children received a pre-
 diction task first, while the other half re-
 ceived an explanation task first. The presen-
 tation of stimuli was also counterbalanced.

 Scoring.-On each of the four predic-

 tion tasks, children's responses were scored
 as being either correct (predicting that the
 puppet would search in the marked but
 empty box) or incorrect (predicting that the
 puppet would search in the unmarked but
 full box). The child received one credit for
 each correct prediction in the four stories;
 total possible correct predictions was four.
 To allow for chance correct replies, a child
 needed three or more correct predictions to
 "succeed"; two or less correct predictions
 was coded as "failed."

 On the five explanation tasks, correct an-
 swers were explanations that attributed a
 false belief to the character, as in Bartsch
 and Wellman (1989). For example, after
 seeing the puppet start to look in the empty
 Band-Aid box, each child was asked, "Why
 do you think he's looking there?" One child
 answered, "Because he thinks there's Band-
 Aids in it," pointing to the Band-Aid box.
 Another child responded to this question
 with "Don't know." In this case the observer
 asked, "What does he think?" and the child
 replied, "That there's Band-Aids in there."
 In conjunction with the invariably correct
 responses to the control question ("Are
 there really?"), both of these answers, un-
 prompted and prompted, were coded as
 false belief attributions. Children giving one
 or more explanations of the puppet's ac-
 tion in terms of the puppet's false belief,
 prompted or unprompted, were coded as of-
 fering explanations in terms of false belief;
 that is, the variable offering explanations
 was dichotomized 0 = no explanation, 1 =
 one or more explanations.

 The results of the analyses are pre-
 sented in three sections. First, the individ-
 ual differences in performance on the false
 belief and affective perspective-taking tasks
 are reported and the relation between chil-
 dren's scores on these measures presented.
 Second, correlations between these time 2
 measures and the measures from time 1 (dis-
 course measures, SES, ratings of family in-
 teraction) are examined. Third, the variance

 The child was then introduced to a se-

 ries of hand puppets and given both predic-
 tion and explanation tasks. In the prediction
 task, the child was told, for example, "Look,
 here's Pam. Pam has a cut, see? And she
 wants a Band-Aid. Where do you think she'll
 look for Band-Aids?" The child's response,
 either pointing or verbally indicating one of
 the two boxes, was recorded. Then the pup-
 pet was made to start to look in the predicted
 location, and the observer asked, "Will she/
 he find [Band-Aids]?" In the explanation
 tasks, the child was introduced to the puppet
 and watched as the puppet started to look in
 the marked, but empty, container. Then the
 observer asked the child to explain the pup-
 pet's action. For example, "Look, here's Bill.
 "Bill has a cut, see? And he wants a Band-
 Aid." (Bill approaches the Band-Aid box and
 starts to open it, without revealing its con-
 tents.) "Why do you think he's looking in
 there?" If the child failed to respond or men-
 tioned only something other than the pup-
 pet's beliefs, the observer prompted with:
 "What does Bill think?" If a false belief was
 mentioned, the child was asked, "Are the
 Band-Aids there really?" to be certain that
 the child had not forgotten the actual con-
 tents of the container.

 Four types of marked containers were
 used: a Band-Aid box, a crayon box, a Play-
 Doh box, and a raisin box. Each unmarked
 box was of the same dimensions as its paired
 marked box, but of a solid color. The differ-
 ent pairs of containers were used to sample
 a variety of situations and to keep children
 from becoming bored. Each pair was intro-
 duced immediately prior to the scenario in
 which it was used. Three of the four types
 of containers were used to present each
 child with the nine total tasks. The re-
 maining type of container was used for a fil-
 ler task, designed to prevent children from
 thinking simply that all of these boxes were
 deceptive (the marked box actually con-
 tained the item).

 dren's and mothers' upperbound MLU and
 the SES level, as reflected in the fathers' oc-
 cupational prestige scores, and to gender.
 Girls scored higher on the affective under-
 standing measure.

 differences in the children's performance on
 the Denham tasks. For the affective aggre-
 gate, scores ranged from 9 to 47; the mean
 was 32.2 (SD 10.4).
 False Belief Task

 There were marked individual differ-
 ences in the children's success on the vari-
 ous sections of the false belief tasks. First,
 it should be noted that only seven children
 succeeded on the prediction tasks. Fourteen
 children offered at least one explanation in
 terms of false belief. Given the small num-
 ber of children who predicted actions in
 terms of false belief (a finding in agreement
 with those of Bartsch & Wellman, 1989), in
 the analyses that follow we omit the predic-
 tion measure; the explanation measure is re-
 tained in view of the theoretical interest in
 children's explanations in false belief tasks.

 The relations between scores on the af-

 fective understanding tasks and on the false
 belief task were next examined. Correlation
 between the affective aggregate and the
 false belief measure did not reach signifi-
 cance at the p < .05 level, r(50) = .25.

 tasks was related to the child's talk about
 feeling states and to mother-child conversa-
 tions about feeling states and about causality
 at the earlier time point. Mothers' upper-
 bound MLU was correlated with explana-
 tions in the false belief tasks, but the SES,
 mothers' education, child MLU, and gender
 associations did not reach significance.

 The relations between the social cogni-
 tion scores and the rating scales of family
 members' interaction were examined next.

 Mother-to-Child Ratings

 The four maternal rating scales (respon-
 siveness, attention, control/intrusiveness, af-
 fection) were each correlated with the two
 social cognition measures from time 2. Of
 the eight correlations, none was significant.
 Mother-to-Sibling Ratings

 Three of the eight correlations between

 mother-to-sibling rating scales and the social
 cognition measures were significant at p <
 .05 (see Table 3). The attention and respon-
 siveness that the mothers showed toward the
 sibling was correlated with the children's
 affective aggregate score at the later time
 point, and the mothers' control/intrusiveness
 toward the sibling was related to the chil-
 dren offering explanations in the false belief
 tasks.

 Correlations were next conducted be-

 tween the two social cognition measures
 from time 2 and (a) total number of talk turns
 per hour of observation and the measures of
 feeling state talk and causal talk during the
 time 1 observations; (b) mother's education,
 father's occupation, gender of the child, and
 the upperbound MLU of child and mother;
 and (c) the rating scales of family members'
 interaction with each other.

 Three of the 10 correlations between

 the five child-to-sibling scales and the two
 social cognition measures were significant
 (see Table 3): The social cognition measures
 were related to the cooperation shown to-
 ward the sibling 7 months earlier, and af-
 fection to the sibling was also related to the
 affective tasks.

 There was no significant relation be-
 tween total talk and the two social cognition
 measures. Table 3 shows the correlations for
 the discourse measures, the MLU measures,
 gender, the education and SES measures,
 and the significant correlations with the rat-
 ing scales. For the affective aggregate score,
 significant correlations were found with the
 child's talk about feelings and about causal-
 ity in the observations 7 months earlier, and
 with mother-child conversations about feel-
 ings and the total talk to the child about feel-

 Of the 10 correlations between the five

 two were significant; sibling affection and

 sality, SES and parental education, ratings
 of mothers' behavior to the sibling, and rat-
 ings of child-sibling interaction are each re-
 lated to some of the individual differences
 in the outcome measures of social cognition.
 However, the interpretation of these univar-
 iate associations is complicated by the rela-
 tions between the variables from time 1. For
 instance, it cannot be assumed that the dis-
 course measures were related to outcome in-
 dependently of SES or parental education.
 In the third set of analyses, we examine (a)
 the variance in each of the social cognition
 measures that could be explained jointly by
 these different sets of variables and (b) the
 unique variance in each outcome measure
 accounted for by each set of predictors.

 Affective Aggregate

 Given the relatively small sample size,

 we limited the variables to be entered to

 four sets. On the basis of the preceding cor-
 relational analyses, the variables selected to
 enter in the multiple regression for this vari-
 able were the rating of child-to-sibling coop-
 eration, father's occupational prestige, the
 upperbound MLU of child and mother en-
 tered as one step, and the discourse vari-
 ables child talk about causality and child talk
 about feelings (minus those turns in which
 cause was discussed) entered as one step.
 Table 4 shows that together these variables
 accounted for 56% of the variance in the af-
 fective aggregate measure. By next conduct-
 ing separate hierarchical multiple regression
 analyses systematically excluding each of
 the four sets of variables in turn, the unique
 variance contributed by each variable was
 determined. Table 4 shows that for the
 affective aggregate variable, the discourse
 variables independently contributed 10% of
 the variance, the child-sibling cooperation

 and the child and mother upperbound MLU
 5%.

 On the issue of gender, as noted earlier,
 boys and girls differed on average on the
 affective aggregate measure. However, we
 are concerned here with the question of
 whether these associations between the pre-
 dictors and affective understanding interact
 with gender. That is, does discourse about
 feelings and causality, for instance, relate to
 affective understanding differently for boys
 and girls? With a sample of 50, power to de-
 tect such gender interactions is very limited.
 However, in order to explore the possibility
 of gender interactions, we conducted the
 multiple regressions separately for boys and
 girls. None of the differences between the
 standardized beta weights for boys and girls
 approached significance.
 Explanation in the False Belief Task

 On the basis of the previous correla-
 tional analyses, the variables selected for the
 multiple regressions for the measure of ex-
 planation in the false belief tasks were as
 follows: the child-sibling cooperation rating,
 the mother-child causal and child feeling
 state talk, the mother's upperbound MLU,
 and the mother-sibling control rating. Table
 4 shows that together these variables ac-
 counted for 39% of the variance in the expla-
 nation measure. The ratings of child-sibling
 cooperation and of the mother's controlling/
 intrusive behavior with the sibling indepen-
 dently contributed 11% and 7% to the pre-
 diction of this measure, and the discourse
 variables 4% independent of the shared
 variance.

 Dunn et al. 1363

 tional forced-choice false belief prediction
 tasks that present a conflict between what
 would satisfy the actor's desire and what she
 believes (see, however, Moses & Flavell,
 1990, for an interpretation of children's ex-
 planations that differs in some respects).
 In this conflict, it appears that 3-year-olds
 weigh the satisfaction of desire over belief;
 they seem unlikely to suppose that someone
 will act in a way that will not satisfy their
 desires. Moreover, in everyday conversation
 it is likely that children are witnesses to, or
 participants in, conversations in which ex-
 planations for behavior in terms of belief are
 given more often than predictions about how
 belief will influence action. For example,
 during the observations mothers frequently
 attempted to sort out disagreements be-
 tween siblings by explaining how the other
 child's (often mistaken) beliefs governed his
 or her actions: "He thought you had finished
 yours"; "She didn't know I had promised it
 to you"; "He thought it was his turn."

 The exploration of the earlier correlates

 of these abilities showed that children who
 grew up in families in which they engaged
 in conversations about feelings and about
 causality were better able 7 months later to
 explain the feelings and actions of the pup-
 pet characters in the task situations. While
 the large number of correlations conducted
 suggests caution about generalizing from
 these data, the results do indicate the use-
 fulness of studying not only global aspects
 of family relationships but also the content
 of family conversations. Each of these as-
 pects of family interaction raises its own set
 of issues about the development of individ-
 ual differences. First, it is possible that in
 the pattern of findings for family discourse
 and affective perspective taking we may be
 picking up a pattern of continuity in child
 differences, rather than evidence for an asso-
 ciation between parental or sibling talk and
 later child outcome. Second, the continuity
 between the discourse measures and the
 abilities assessed 7 months later was not ex-
 plained by the children's verbal fluency, nor
 by the amount of talk in the family. We
 should, of course, be very cautious about
 suggesting causal links from these correla-
 tional data; the results, however, do support
 the view that the conceptual development
 reflected in the abilities revealed in the af-
 fective perspective-taking and false belief
 tasks may have been encouraged through
 the conversations in which the children
 participated-that is, that language specific
 in content may have in part mediated the

 Discussion

 At 40 months, the children in this study

 differed widely in their understanding of the
 situational determinants of others' feelings,
 and while some were able to explain actions
 in terms of false beliefs, the majority were
 not. While any direct comparison of perfor-
 mance on the explanation and prediction
 tasks would be inappropriate--with one a
 forced-choice and the other an open-ended
 task-it is worth noting that twice as many
 children provided explanations linking ac-
 tion to beliefs as those who made predic-
 tions successfully in the forced-choice tasks.
 We take these results to support the argu-
 ment of Bartsch and Wellman (1989) that
 some children of this age can understand
 belief constructs and can engage in belief-
 desire reasoning, even though they fail tradi-

 conceptual development. It is of course
 equally possible that children's participation
 in conversations about causality and feelings
 and their later performance on sociocogni-
 tive tasks both reflect some common under-
 lying ability rather than any direct causal
 link. Third, a larger number of correlations
 were found for talk about feelings than talk
 about causality. This may reflect the fact that
 the causal talk category was not limited to
 behavioral or psychological causality but in-
 cluded a broad range of causal discussion.
 The results from the analysis of the rat-

 ings of family interaction raise four further
 issues. First, associations were found be-
 tween the children's cooperation with their
 siblings and their later performance on the
 social cognition tasks. Again, it would be in-
 appropriate to draw conclusions about di-
 rectional cause-effect links. It could be that
 through cooperation and play with the sib-
 ling children gain insights into the thoughts,
 actions, and feelings of the other child-who
 is of course closer in interests and feelings
 to the child than a parent would be. Such
 a view is compatible with the arguments
 for the significance of peer interaction in
 sociocognitive development (Hartup, 1983).
 However, it is also possible that with greater
 skills of understanding others, children are
 able to cooperate and play more effectively;
 here the pattern of results would be seen as
 reflecting a continuity in differences be-
 tween children. Such an argument would be
 supported by the evidence for a positive
 relation between emotional understanding
 and children's relationships with peers (Cas-
 sidy & Parke, 1990; Denham, McKinley,
 Couchoud, & Holt, 1990; Rothenberg, 1970).
 In common sense terms, it seems likely
 that both processes may operate. Second,
 the lack of association between ratings of
 mother-child interaction and the social cog-
 nition tasks should be noted. Connections
 might well have been expected here, espe-
 cially in light of the associations between
 mother-child discourse and the outcome
 measures. This failure to demonstrate con-
 nections could reflect insensitivity of the rat-
 ings of maternal behavior (though the find-
 ings on mother-to-sibling ratings decrease
 the plausibility of this interpretation). It
 could also be-as we have noted-that it is
 child differences, rather than differences in
 maternal behavior, that are key to the con-
 nection between the discourse and social
 cognition measures, at least within the range
 of differences within this sample.

 The third point concerns the question

 of why there should be a clearer pattern of
 association between the family measures
 and the children's affective perspective-
 taking measure than the false belief mea-
 sure. It could be that this is primarily a statis-
 tical matter, which reflects differences in the
 distribution of scores in the two outcome
 measures-with a greater range of individ-
 ual variation in the affective perspective-
 taking measure. Such a difference reflects in
 part the different developmental course of
 the growth of these two aspects of social un-
 derstanding: Understanding of emotions ap-
 pears earlier in childhood than the ability to
 understand other minds and to relate actions
 to beliefs. However, an intriguing issue
 for future investigation is the question of
 whether these two domains of social under-
 standing are in fact influenced to differing
 degrees by the features of family relation-
 ships and discourse that were considered
 here. Is emotional understanding influenced
 to a greater extent by patterns of family inter-
 action than the development of the ability
 to grasp the links between thoughts, beliefs,
 and action? The relation between these two
 aspects of social understanding deserves fur-
 ther study.

 The final point raised by the analysis of
 the ratings concerns the links found be-
 tween mother-sibling interaction and the
 children's social cognitive sophistication.
 Children who grew up in families in which
 their mothers engaged in relatively frequent
 controlling behavior with the older sibling
 were more likely to be able to give expla-
 nations in the false belief task; they also
 tended to be better at affective labeling and
 perspective taking if their mothers had been
 highly responsive and affectionate with the
 sibling than children whose mothers and
 siblings were not involved in this way.
 These results alert us to the importance of
 recognizing that children grow up as family
 members, and that the salient influences on
 children's development include more than
 the behavior or language directed directly to
 them. Children are extremely interested in
 what happens between their siblings and
 their parents, monitoring closely both the
 language (Dunn & Shatz, 1989) and the emo-
 tions expressed (Dunn & Kendrick, 1982;
 Dunn & Munn, 1985). It is of course highly
 adaptive for children who are born into a
 social group-the family-to attend to and
 begin to make sense of the interaction be-
 tween those other family members early in
 their own development. The findings of the
 present study remind us that the appropriate

 framework in which we should study devel-
 opmental influences is that of the family,
 rather than solely that of a parent-child dyad.
 Promising next steps in the investigation of
 individual differences in understanding oth-
 ers will be to examine in more detail the
 nature of interaction between siblings impli-
 cated, to clarify which particular aspects of
 discourse about others are most important,
 to pursue the issue of gender differences in
 early understanding of other people, and to
 conduct longitudinal studies to explore the
 prognostic significance of these early differ-
 ences in understanding other minds.
