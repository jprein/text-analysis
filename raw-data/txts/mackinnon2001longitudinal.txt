Abstract
This study tested an integrative, multipathway model designed to explain bidirectional effects of the attributions and
coercive behaviors of mothers and sons in the context of a longitudinal study. Subjects were 246 mothers and sons
who were 7–9 years of age. Mothers’ and sons’ attributions about one another’s intent were significantly related to
the aggressiveness of the behavior that each of them directed toward the other. Boys’ earlier aggression did not
significantly predict the mothers’ subsequent attributions, whereas mothers’ negative behavior indeed predicted
subsequent negative attributions on the part of the boys. Even after considering children’s earlier negative behavior,
children’s negative attributions about their mothers helped explain the aggressiveness of their subsequent behavior.
The same was not true for mothers whose earlier attributions indirectly influenced their subsequent aggressive
behavior.

ined the formative influence of social cogni-
tions and attributional biases, most have only
considered parents’ perceptions and attribu-
tions, ignoring the potential impact of chil-
dren’s attributions. Dix and his colleagues
(Dix & Grusec, 1985; Dix & Lochman, 1990;
Dix, Ruble, & Zambarano, 1989) have pro-
posed and tested a model in which attributions
mediate the association between child behav-
ior and the parent’s response, such that attri-
butions of intentionality and responsibility
predict stronger responses to misbehavior. In
addition, Bugental and her colleagues (Bugen-
tal, Blue, & Lewis, 1990; Bugental & Shen-
num, 1984) reported that mothers who per-
ceive themselves as having low control
exacerbate their children’s uncontrollability
by responding in a highly reactive and inef-
fectual manner. Though not considered by
Bugental and Shennum (1984), children’s so-
cial cognitions have been included in other
studies concerned with peer-directed aggres-
sion. For example, Dodge (Dodge, 1986;
Dodge, Murphy, & Buchsbaum, 1984) has
shown that aggressive children are more in-

behave more aggressively.

Because that study and previous studies of
peer relationships were cross section, the di-
rections of influence between negative attri-
butions and aggressive behavior could not be
examined. MacKinnon et al. (1990) suggested
that bidirectional influences likely occur in
that “both the inclination to attribute negative
intent when such intent does not exist (i.e.,
attributional biases) and the proclivity to fo-
cus upon negative behavior when it does oc-
cur may not only potentiate coerciveness, but
also may be generated by coercion” (MacKin-
non et al., 1990, p. 6). The goal of the present
study was to disentangle bidirectional effects
of the attributions and coercive behaviors of
mothers and children in the context of a longi-
tudinal study.

boys (Dodge et al., 1984; MacKinnon–Lewis
et al., 1992, 1994). Nine mothers had less
than a seventh grade education, 14 had gradu-
ate degrees; the mean level of education was
13.0 years. One-hundred thirty-nine of the
mothers were White, and 107 were Black.

A second set of questions pertained to the
direction of influence between negative attri-
butions and aggression behavior. From an
affective–cognitive perspective, we asked
whether mothers’ and sons’ earlier negative
attributions affected their subsequent aggres-
sive behavior independent of the effects of
their earlier aggressive behavior. We hypothe-
sized that both mothers’ and sons’ later ag-
gressive behavior would be explained better
when we considered both their earlier nega-
tive attributions and their earlier aggression.
This would lend support to the notion that the
inclination to attribute negative intent indeed
potentiates aggressive behavior.

Six public schools in a metropolitan south-
eastern city provided lists of all boys enrolled
in the second, third, and fourth grades. We
identified all boys who met selection criteria
and contacted their mothers by phone. In or-
der to participate, boys had to be 7, 8, or 9
years of age, they had to be Black or White,
and their mothers had to be currently married

(Strassberg, 1995). If parents attribute nega-

figure so that appropriate comparisons can be
made among the various paths.

The GFI is a measure of goodness of fit
that quantifies the proportion of the variances
and covariances in the original covariance
matrix that are explained by the predicted co-
variance matrix estimated from the hypothe-
sized model (Joreskog & Sorbom, 1988). Un-
like the chi-square statistics, GFI rewards
simpler models with few parameters and it is
preferable that these values are close to one
(and certainly greater than .80).

The model depicted in Figure 2 is consis-
tent with our hypothesis that children’s nega-
tive attributions contribute significantly to
their subsequent aggressive behavior, even
after considering their previous levels of ag-
gression. The mothers’ earlier aggressive be-
havior significantly predicted the children’s
subsequent negative attributions about their
mothers. Mothers’ negative attributions at
Time 1 did not significantly predict their sub-
sequent aggressive behavior. Moreover, the
children’s earlier aggressive behavior did not
contribute to mothers’ subsequent attributions
about their children. Instead, the associations
between the mothers’ prior attributions and
their subsequent behavior appeared to be me-
diated via the mothers’ attributions at Time 2
(see Figure 2).

Using the stability model as a baseline, we
next tested the model, depicted in Figure 2,
suggesting that negative attributions of the

Discussion

The results of this longitudinal study provide
the first substantive evidence in support of the
hypothesis that negative attributions may af-
fect aggressive behavior within the mother–
son dyad. The correlational analyses within
both assessments revealed that mothers’ and
sons’ negative attributions about one anoth-
er’s intent were associated with the aggres-
siveness of the behavior that each of them di-
rected toward the other. Moreover, children’s
attributions about
their mothers at Time 1
were related to their negative behavior with

their mothers at Time 2; mothers’ attributions
at Time 1 were not related to their behavior
at Time 2.

Interestingly,

the correlational data also
showed mothers’ negativity at Time 1 to be
related to their sons’ negative attributions
about their mothers at Time 2. It was also the
case that boys’ earlier negative behavior was
related to their mothers’subsequent attribu-
tions about their sons, raising the question as
to whether the attributions are indeed biases
or reasonable inferences made based on previ-
ous interactions. Because of the correlational
nature of these data, however, directions of
influence could not be determined from the
cross-sectional data.

As a result, questions pertaining to the di-
rection of influence between attributions and
aggressive behavior in the mother–son rela-
tionship were explored using the longitudinal
data. Specifically, structural equation model-

ing techniques were used to test the hypothe-
sis that mothers’ and sons’ negative attribu-
tions directly and significantly affect
their
subsequent aggressive behavior. Boys’ nega-
tive attributions predicted their subsequent ag-
gressive behavior with their mothers, even
after measures of their earlier aggressive be-
havior were taken into account.

The same was not true of the mothers. Al-
though mothers’ negative attributions were
associated with their aggressive behavior
within time, their earlier negative attributions
did not predict their subsequent aggressive be-
havior directly, although indirect paths were
evident. Specifically, maternal attributions at
Time 2 were significantly correlated with in-
dices of mothers’ aggressiveness at Time 2,
after accounting for their attributions at Time
1. It thus appeared that mothers’ earlier attri-
butions indirectly influenced their subsequent
behavior.

tributions about their mothers contributed sig-
nificantly to the aggressiveness of their be-
havior with their mothers. This suggests that
the children’s negative behavior did not sim-
ply represent a behavioral response to the
mothers’ negative behavior or a stable ten-
dency on the part of the children to behave
aggressively. Rather, children’s negative attri-
butions about their mothers appeared to play
an independent role in shaping their aggres-
sive behavior toward their mothers. Certainly,
mothers’ negative attributions about their sons
did not appear to play such a role in shaping
their aggressive behavior toward their sons;
however, one explanation of the data is that
early maternal attributions affect later mater-
nal aggressiveness indirectly through earlier
maternal aggressiveness.

in earlier experiences within the family, par-
ticularly as boys exposed to more coercive
family experiences are more likely to be ag-
gressive and rejected by their peers (Dishion,
1990; MacKinnon–Lewis et al., 1994). In ad-
dition, the results add to our growing under-
standing of the processes associated with the
establishment and maintenance of relationship
trajectories. Not all outcomes of any given
experiences need be pathological
(Sroufe,
1990); and studies such as this provide infor-
mation about both normative and nonnorma-
tive development (Cicchetti, 1990).

Third, since the sample in this study was a
normative one, there would be merit in deter-
mining whether the associations between neg-
ative attributions and aggression were evident
in nonnormative samples. It may be that the
associations would be even stronger in a sam-
ple of aggressive boys, for example. Fourth,
the children studied here all ranged from 7 to
9 years of age at the start of the study. It is
unclear whether the same processes would be
evident if older or younger children had been
studied. Fifth, the dyads were followed for
only 1 year; it is unclear whether the same
effects would have been evident if they had
been followed for longer periods of time, par-
ticularly if assessments were made in various
developmental phases.
