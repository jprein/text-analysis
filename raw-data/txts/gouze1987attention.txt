Recently,developmentapl sychologistshavebegunto examineindividual dif- ferencesin cognitive mechanismsas important determinantsof aggressive behaviorin children. The work of KennethDodgeand his colleagues(Dodge, 1980; Dodge & Frame, 1982; Dodge & Newman, 1981; Dodge & Tomlin,
1983; Milich & Dodge, 1984; Richard & Dodge, 1982) has led to the for- mulationof asocialinformation-processingmodelof aggressionthatattempts to delineatethe componentstepsrequiredto analyzeand reactto aggressive interactionsby peers(Dodge, 1986). Thesestepsinclude (1) the perception and decodingof cues, (2) making attributions about peers'intentions and developingexpectationsregardingfuture peerbehavior,and (3) choosinga response,i.e., problemsolving.
In aseriesof researchstudies,Dodgeandhiscolleaguesidentifiedthree typesof processingdeficienciesin aggressiveboysthat correspondto the steps in this model and seemto contributeto their aggressivebehavior. On the basisof findings indicating that aggressiveboys collect fewer piecesof in- formation about a peer prior to making a decisionabout intent (Dodge& Newman,1981)andusefewerof therelevantcuesneededto makeadeci- sionwhenthenumberof cuesavailableisexperimentallycontrolled(Dodge & Tomlin, 1983),Milich andDodge(1984)identifieda"cue-utilizationdefi- ciency"in aggressiveboys.This deficiencyoccursat the first stepin the model, the perceptionand decodingof cues.At the secondpoint in the social information-processingsequenceD, odge(1980)andDodgeandFrame(1982) found that aggressiveboys are more likely than their nonaggressivepeers toattributehostileintenttoothersinambiguoussituations.Milich andDodge (1984)labelledthisdeficiencya"hostileattributionalbias."Finally, Richard andDodge(1982)foundthat whenit comestimeto problem-solve,aggressive boystend to generatefewer alternativesolutionsto hypotheticalpeerpro- blemsthantheirpopularcounterpartsandthatthesolutionstheydogenerate are more aggressiveand less efficient. This deficiencyhas beenlabelled a "responsedecisionbias." (Milich & Dodge, 1984). Thesefindings support theearlierworkof Spivack,Platt,andShure(1976),whichalsodocumented socialproblem-solvingdeficienciesin aggressivechildren but hascomeunder attackrecentlyowingto failuresby otherauthorsto replicatethesefindings (seeKrasnor & Rubin, 1981, for a review).
While Dodgeand his colleagueshaveclearly documenteddeficiencies in the socialinformation-processingskills of aggressiveboysfrom the percep- tion anddecodingstagethroughtheproblem-solvingstage,theyhavelarge- ly ignoredcertaintypesof attentionaldifferencesbetweenaggressiveand nonaggressiveboys. In a study by Gouze (1981) on modifying the effects of aggressivetelevision on initially high and low aggressivechildren, preliminary evidencewas found to support the hypothesisthat highly ag- gressivechildren focuson aggressivecuesin their environment(e.g., fighting) while lessaggressivechildrenfocuson othertypesof information (e.g.,the

consequenceosf anaggressiveaction).A tendency,particularlyattheyounger preschoolages,to focus on aggressiveinteractionsin the environment,or to bemorehighlydistractedby aggressiveinteractions,mightresultin children perceivingthe world as a more hostile place-a perceptionthat could be critical in affectinga child'sultimatedecisionregardingaction.Also, Dodge's f i n d i n g s h a v e b e e n b a s e d o n w o r k w i t h e l e m e n t a r ys c h o o l c h i l d r e n . I t i s l i k e l y that deficienciesin social information processingbegin as early as the preschoolyears,sothatbythetimetheyreachelementaryschoolaggressive children are alreadyat a social disadvantage.
The presentstudy was designedto examinethe relationshipbetween two cognitiveprocessingvariables-attentionanddecisionmaking(i.e., social problemsolving)-andaggresivebehaviorin preschool-ageboys.For pur- posesof this study,attentionwasdefinedin a mannerconsistentwith tradi- tionalnotionsof selectiveattention,i.e.,astheindividual'stendencyto focus on or selectout certainaspectsof theenvironmentfrom competingcues(Swets Kristofferson,1970).It wasexpectedthat,comparedto nonaggressivemales, aggressivemaleswould havea muchgreatertendencyto focuson or select out aggressivecuesin theenvironment.This wasassessedin termsof (1) their abilityto shifttheirattentionawayfromaggressivecuesand(2)theirtendency to be distractedby aggressivecues.Owing to the useof a preschoolpopula- tion, social problem solving was assessedwith the PreschoolInterpersonal ProblemSolvingTest(PIPS)developedby ShureandSpivack(1975).This instrumentis designedto measurea child's ability to generatealternativesolu- tionsto socialproblemsituations(Shure,Spivack,Jaeger,1971;Spivack, etal., 1976).As aresultof recentcontroversiesoverthevalidityof theShure andSpivackfindings(Krasnor& Rubin, 1981)andtheRichardandDodge (1982)findingsregardingthetypesof solutionsaggressiveboysgive, thecon- tent of children'sresponsesto PIPS problemswere assessedin addition to thenumberof differentresponsestheygave.It wasexpectedthatthemore aggressiveboyswouldprovidefeweralternativesolutionsto PIPSproblems and that thesewould be more aggressivein nature.
SinceIQ, or generalintelligence,is likely to covarywith both attention andsocialproblemsolving,thepossibilitythatIQ actsasamediatingvariable in theserelationshipswas also explored.
METHOD
Subjects
The participantsin this studywere43 malesrangingfrom 46 to 64 monthsof age(M = 53.9months;SD -- 5.6months).Onlymaleswerein- cludedbecausethereis considerableevidencethat aggressionis moreprevalent

 184 Gouze
amongpreschool-ageboysthan amongpreschool-agegirls (Feshbach,1970; Maccoby& Jacklin, 1974).Twenty-sixof the subjectscamefrom daycare settingsservicinga predominatelylower- or working-classpopulation; the other 17weredrawn from a nurseryschoolservicinga primarily white middle- class population. The day care children had a mean age of 52.04 months with a standarddeviationof 4.94, while the nurseryschoolchildrenhad a meanageof 56.82monthswith astandarddeviationof 5.31months.Com- binedstandardscoresfromtheinformationandblockdesignsubtestsof the WechslerPreschoolandPrimaryScaleof Intelligence(WPPSI)weresimilar for the two populations(day care:M = 22.58, SD = 4.67; nurseryschool: M = 20.59, SD = 4.05).
Predictor Measures
In orderto assesschildren'sselectiveattentionto aggressiveor nonag- gressivestimuli in their environment,two new attentionmeasures-anat- tentional shifting task and a distractibility task-were developedexpressly for usein this study. During pilot testingtheir appropriatenessfor a preschool population was established.
AttentionalShifting Task. This task was designedto assessthe child's a b i l i t y t o s h i f t h i s a t t e n t i o n a w a y f r o m a g g r e s s i v es o c i a l s t i m u l i ( e . g . , f i g h t i n g ) 9ascomparedto nonaggressivesocialstimuli (e.g.,cooperativeplaying)when
requiredto do so-i.e., whentold by the experimenterto attendto another task. The participantwas showna videotapedpuppetshowthat depictedtwo puppetsin a seriesof alternatingaggessiveinteractions(e.g., fighting over possessionof a ball) and nonaggressiveinteractions(e.g., sharinga cookie). The aggressiveinteractionsincludedyelling, calling eachother names,and hitting eachother with objects,while the nonaggressiveinteractionsfocussed on cooperativeplay and verbalizationsabout how it feels to shareand to beafriend.An effortwasmadeto maintainequivalentlevelsof noiseand actionin all the skits, therebyreducingthe possibilitythat variability in for- mal featuresof theproductionwould makeonetypeof skit moreattention- getting than the other. Subjectiveratings by adult viewers confirmed that the two typesof sceneswereequally"attention-getting."The skits wereeach 2 minutes long, with the total show lasting 12 minutes.
Participantswere encouragedto watch the puppet show but to "keep oneeye"ontheredlight placednextto thetelevisionset,andto shutif off as quickly as possiblewhen it came on. This occurredtwice during the in- troductionto thepuppetshowandtwiceduringeach2minuteskit. Thechild's latency in respondingto the light was recordedby the experimenterin each i n s t a n c e .

Eachchild's scoreconsistedof his meanreactiontime while viewing the six nonaggressivescenessubtractedfrom his meanreactiontime while viewing the six aggressivescenes.This differencesscoreprovideda single indexdescribinga child'srelativetendencyto shift awayfrom aggressiveas comparedto nonaggressivesocialstimuli. Thisindexcouldthenbecorrelated with the criterion measuresof aggression.
AttentionalDistractibility Task.Thistaskassessedthechild's differential tendencyto be distractedfrom an ongoingtask by aggressiveas compared to nonaggressivesocial stimuli. The ongoingtask consistedof playing with a water-tosstoy until all the rings wereon the pegs.The distractingsocial stimuli weretwo editedversionsof the Sylvesterand Tweetiecartoonseries. In one version (270 secondslong), only highly aggressivesceneshad been retained;in the other (280 secondslong), all the aggressivesceneshad been edited out. Again, the two versionswere equatedas much as possiblefor format variables,and adults subjectivelyrated them as equally "attention- getting."Eachchild sawbothcartoons;theorderin whichtheywerepresented was randomlyassignedto participants.In order to producesomeinterest in thecartoons,participantswereallowedto watchthemfor 20secondsbefore beginningthewater-tosstask.Eachboywastoldthatduringviewinghewould heara whistle, at which point he shouldimmediatelybeginworking on the water-tosstoy and continueuntil he had all the rings on the pegs.
For eachcartoon,the experimenterecordedtwo scores-thenumber of timestheparticipantlookedup at thecartoonwhile working on thewater- tosstoy, and the lengthof time he spentlooking at the televisioneachtime he glancedup (i.e., the duration/timeslooking score).Eight children, five from the day caregroup and threefrom the nurseryschoolgroup, did not respondtothewhistleandwereeliminatedfromtheseanalysesT. hesechildren had a rangeof aggressionscores;therefore,their eliminationwas not likely to bias the results.Throughthe subtractionof scoresobtainedduring the nonaggressivecartoonfrom scoresobtainedduring the aggressivecartoon, eachchild's final scorereflectedthe differencebetweenhis distractibility to aggressiveand nonaggressivestimuli. Again, this differencescoreprovided a single index comparingperformancein the aggressiveand nonaggressive cartoonconditionsthatcouldthenbecorrelatedwith thecriterionmeasures of aggression.
SocialProblem-SolvingMeasure.Thepeerproblemsfrom thePreschool InterpersonaPl roblemSolvingTest(PIPS;Shure& Spivack,1971)wereus- edto assessalternativesolutionsthinking in the participants.Theseproblems consistof a seriesof hypotheticalinterpersonalconflictsin which Child A is playing with a toy that Child B wants. The participantis askedto think

of as many ways as he can for Child B to get the toy. The sameproblem is presentedseventimes with different hypotheticalchildren and toys.

The percent agreementbetweenthe two in- dependent scorers was calculated as 2 (the number of common agreements)/(thenumber of judgmentsof A + the number of judgments of B). Interrateragreementfor thescoringcategoriesrangedform 82to 90%.
IntelligenceMeasure.On thebasisof Silverstein's(1970)findingsthat they correlate.84 with total WPPSI scores,combinedscoresfrom the In- formation and Block subtestsof the WechslerPreschooland Primary Scale of Intelligence(WPPSI) were usedto assessgeneralintelligence.Standar- dized administration and scoring, as specified in the WPPSI Manual (Wechsler, 1967), were followed.
Criterion Measures
ObservationalData. In an effort to obtain ecologicallyvalid informa- tion regardingchildren'sreal-life aggressiveinteractions,an observationcode wasdevelopedbasedlargelyon StrayerandStrayer's(1976)work on preschool aggressionand dominancehierarchies.The coding categoresincluded five physicalaggressioncategories(chases,pushes/pulls,hits, kicks, grabsob- jects) and a single category of verbal aggression. Definitions of these categoriesas provided for the observerswere as follows: (1) Chases-any time a child runs after anotherchild (to avoid subjectivejudgmentsno in- ferencesweremaderegardinghostileintent; however,item total correlations revealedthat chasescorrelatedhighly (r = .78) with an overall aggression s c o r e , ( 2 ) p u s h e s / p u l l s -a n y t i m e a c h i l d h o l d s o n t o a n o t h e r c h i l d a n d p u l l s him towardhimselfor anobject(e.g.,atoy) or pusheshim awayfrom himself or an object; (3) hits-any time a child strikesanotherchild with his hand

RESULTS
Analysisof the Two Populations
Owing to perceiveddifferencesduring testingin the classroomstruc- ture and interactionsin the two types of settings(nurseryschool and day care),preliminaryanalyseswereconductedto assesspossibledifferencesbe- tweenthetwopopulationsonthecriterionmeasuresA. t-testanalysisrevealed substantialdifferencesbetweenthe populationson teacherrating factorsof hostile-aggressive(t(41) = 2.89,p < .01) and anxious-fearful(t(41) = 2.05,
p < .05).Whereasthedaycarepopulationhadmeanaggressionratingsof 4.35andmeananxietyratingsof 2.62,thenurseryschoolpopulationhad meanaggressionratingsof 1.77 and meananxietyratingsof .94. Day care childrenalsoevidencedhigherfrequenciesof observedphysicalaggression (meanof 15.27instancesascomparedto a meanof 10.65instances),although this differencewas not satisticallysignificant. Owing to thesedifferences, data for the two populationswere analyzedseparately.
RelationshipBetweenAttention and AggressiveBehavior
Analysis of the relationshipbetweenthe attentionvariablesand the observationaldata substantiatedthe hypothesisthat children who are behaviorallymore aggressiveattendmore to aggressivesocial interactions in their environment. As seenin Table I, a strongpositive correlationwas found betweenthe attentionalshifting differencescoreand physicalaggres- sionin the nurseryschoolpopulation(r = .54,p < .01), indicatingthat nurseryschoolchildrenwho hadmoredifficulty shiftingtheir attentionaway from theaggressivepuppetskitsascomparedto thenon-aggressiveskitswere alsomorephysicallyaggressiveintheclassroom.A similarrelationshipwas obtainedbetweenthe attentionalshifting differencescoreand verbal aggres- sion, althoughthis correlationdid not reachstatisticalsignificance.No rela- tionship was found betweenattentiondistractibility and observedaggression

Thus,daycarechildren w h o l o o k e d u p f r o m t h e w a t e r - t o s st a s k t o w a t c h t e l e v i s i o n m o r e o f t e n w h i l e t h e a g g r e s s i v ec a r t o o n w a s p l a y i n g t h a n w h i l e t h e n o n a g g r e s s i v ec a r t o o n w a s playingweremorephysicallyandverballyaggressivein theclassroom.For this group no relationshipwas found betweenattentionalshifting and observ- edclassroombehavior.In summary,althoughthepatternof resultswasslightly different for the two populations,in both groupsof children thosewho at- tendedmore to aggressivesocial stimuli than to nonaggressivesocial stimuli were observedto be more aggressivein the classroom.
In order to determinewhetherthesedifferenceswere a function of ag- gressivechildrenattendingmoreto aggressivestimuli or lessto nonaggressive stimuli, correlationswere computedfor the two types of stimuli separately for both attention tasks. As seenin Table II the results are accountedfor by the tendencyof aggressiveboysto havedifficulty shifting their attention away from aggressivestimuli and to be more distractedby them. For the nurseryschoolpopulation,theseresultsweredramatic,with apositivecor- relation of .57 (p < .01) betweenthe attentionalshifting scorefor the ag- gressivestimulus and physical aggressionand a positive correlation of .53 (p < .01) for the distractibility score during the aggressivestimulus and p h y s i c a l a g g r e s s i o n .I n t h e d a y c a r e p o p u l a t i o n t h e o n l y s i g n i f i c a n t p o s i t i v e

Relationship BetweenSocial Problem Solving and Aggression
Contraryto the Shureand Spivackfindings (Shureet al., 1971; Shure & Spivack, 1975), in this study a positive relationshipwas not found be- tweenthe numberof alternativesolutionsa child generatedto the PIPS ques- tion and adaptivebehaviorin the classroom.In fact, the oppositerelationship was obtainedfor the nurseryschoolchildren; thosewho gavemore solutions tendedto be more aggressivein the classroom.As seenin Table II, nursery schoolchildrenwith higherfrequenciesof observedphysicalaggressionin the classroomgavea greaternumberof relevantsolutions(r = .43,p <

Thus, in contrast to the Shure and Spivack findings, nurseryschoolchildrenwho provideda greaternumberof responsesto the PIPS problems were more, not less aggressivein the classroom.

The relationship betweensocial problem solving scoresand teacher ratings of behaviorwas similar to the relationshipobtainedwith the obser- vationaldata(seeTableIV).

tionship found beteweenobservedbehaviorand teacherratings of behavior was a positive correlationbetweenobservedfrequenciesof verbal aggression andteacherratingsof hostile-aggressive(r = .46,p < .01). It thusappeared that the nursery school teachers'ratings were a more valid reflection of observedbehaviorin the classroomthan the day careteachers'ratings. In both populations, teacher ratings of hostile-aggressiveand hyperactive- distractibleweresignificantlyrelated(r = .47,p < .05;r = .37,p < .01, for the nursery school and day care populations, respectively).
Role of Intelligence
No significantrelationshipsfor eitherpopulationwerefound between WPPSI scoresand observedbehavior. However, significant negativecor- relationswerefoundbetweenteacherratingsof behaviorandWPPSIscores for bothgroupsof children.Thesecorrelationsrangedfrom -.34to -.58. With the exceptionof the correlationbetweenWPPSI scoresand teachers' ratingsof hostile-aggressivein the nurseryschoolpopulation,all thesecor- relationsweresignificantatleastatthe.05level.No relationshipswerefound betweenWPPSI scoresand attentionscoresor socialproblem-solvingscores for either population.
Owing to the correlationsbetweenWPPSI scoresand the criterion variables,partial correlationswereperformedon all data. The resultingcor- relationsrevealedlittle changein the relationshipsdescribedearlier and are providedparentheticallyin all tablesfor comparisionpurposes.For the day carepopulation,correlationsbetweenteacherratingsof aggressivenesasnd the number of aggressivefirst responsesand superfluouscommentsgiven in responseto thePIPSproblemswerereducedto zerowhenWPPSIscores werepartialedout. However,no other alterationsin the patternof results occurredas a function of viewing theserelationshipsindependentlyof in- telligence. In particular, relationshipsbetweenthe predictor variables and observedbehavior remainedthe same.
DISCUSSION
The resultsof this study indicatethat individual differencesin atten- tion and social problem solving correlatewith individual differencesin behavioralaggressionin lower and middle-classpreschoolmales.Assuming that attentionis relatedto the amount and the contentof the information a child acquires,aggressiveboysarelikely to havedifferentinformationabout a given social conflict situation than their nonaggressivepeeerswhen mak-

ing decisionsabouthow to resolveconflict situations.Sincethe aggressive preschool-ageboysin this studyattendedmoreto aggressivethanto nonag- gressivesocialinteractionsin their environment,it is likely that theyobtain- ed more information about this type of interactionthan about positive interactions.Thisfindingisconsistentwith thefindingsof Dodgeandhis colleagues(Dodge& Newman,1981:Dodge& Tomlin, 1983)that aggressive boysdemonstratedeficienciesattheperceptionanddecodinglevelof social information processing.
The socialproblem-solvingresultsof this studyalsosupporteda link betweensocialproblem-solvingand aggressivebehavior.However,contrary totheShureandSpivackfindings(Shureetal., 1971;Shure& Spivack,1975), the contentof the solutionsboys provided was a far better predictor of behaviorin thisstudythanthenumberof solutionstheyprovided.Boysin both populationswho were behaviorallymore poorly adjusted(i.e., rated as aggressiveor hyperactiveby their teachersor observedto be more ag- gressivein the classroom)provideda greaternumberof aggressivesolutions to the hypotheticalinterpersonapl roblemsituations.This resultwasconsis- tent with the Richardand Dodge(1982)findingsthat aggressiveelementary schoolboysgeneratefewersolutionsto hypotheticalproblemsandthesolu- tions havegreateraggressivecontent.However,contraryto the Shureand Spivack (1975) and the Richard and Dodge (1982)findings, the boys who providedagreaternumberof alternativesolutionsweregenerallymore,not less,aggressive.Theseresultswereconsistentwiththeexperimentersim' pres- sionsduringtesting.Oncetheyhadgivena sociallyappropriateresponse, manyof the boyswerereluctantto add others.This observationis consis- tentwith therecentfindingthatmiddle-classchildrenfrequentlyoffersocially appropriateresponsesto hypotheticalproblemsituationswhenasked,but observationsrevealthattheydonotactuallyactastheysaidtheywouldwhen confrontedwith similarsituationsin theclassroom(Krason& Rubin, 1978). (Thisindicatesthatanobservationaml easureofsocialproblemsolvingsuch as that suggestedby Krasnor and Rubin (1978)is more likely to correlate with behavioral adjustmentthan the more typically used hypothetical measures.)
The differentpatternsof resultsfor the two populationsin this study, ' particularlyon the attentionmeasuresw, asnot predictedand, at this point, onlyconjecturalexplanationsfor thesedifferencescanbeoffered.Theyare
mostlikely a functionof class-normdifferencesin responsesto experimenter demandandin thedefinition,identification,andmanifestationsof aggressive behaviorin middle-classand lower classpopulations.For example,it is con- ceivablethat middle-classboysdid not look differentfrom their nonaggressive peersonthedistractibilitytaskbecausemiddle-classnormsfor responding to adult demandsto stay on task (i.e., play with the water-tosstoy) are

strongerthanin lower-classpoulations.Similarly,onthesocialproblem- solvingtask,middle-classnurseryschoolchildrenappearedto beawarethat it was not appropriateto give aggressiveresponsesto these problems regardlessof what they would actuallydo in similar real-life situations.In contrast,thelower-classdaycarechildrendid not inhibit theseresponsesand describedtheir behaviormore accurately.Finally, the differencein correla- tions betweenteacherratings and actual behavior in the two populations revealedthatthedaycareteacherse' xpectationsfor, anddefinitionsof, ag- gressivebehaviorwerelessconsistenwt ith actualbehavioralaggressionthan the nurseryschoolteachers'.Whereasaggressivebehaviorin the nursery school setting was relatively rare, and, hence, highly salient and easy for teachersto rate,aggressivebehaviorin thedaycareappearedto bemuch more common and heterogeneousand, hence, more difficult to rate discriminatively.
In general,resultsfromthisstudymustbeviewedcautiouslybecause of the relativelysmall numberof childrenstudied,the shifting patternof resultsin the two populations,and the useof videotaped,ratherthan real- life, presentationsN. everthelessc,onsistentwith Dodge'sfindings(Dodge& Frame,1980;Dodge& Newman,1981;Dodge& Tomlin, 1983;Milich & Dodge, 1984),the data from both samplessuggestthat differentially ag- gressivechildrenprocessinformationabouttheir environmentsdifferently. First, theattentionof moreaggressivepreschool-ageboysseemto becap- tured by aggressivesocial interactions;they have more difficulty shifting awayfrom suchinteractionsandappearto bemoredistractedbythem.When it comestimeto resolvesuchconflictstheyfrequentlyprovideaggressivesolu- tions. Although causalstatementscannotbe madeon the basisof the cor- relationaldataobtainedin this study,it is notablethat, asearlyasthe preschoolyears,differentialcognitiveprocessingand differentialbehavior seemtoberelated.It maybehypothesizedthatbyfocusingmoreonaggressive interactions,boyswho arealreadyoverlyaggressiveareincreasinglylikely to perceivethe world as hostile. In a quickly spiraling effect, they are then likely to focusevenmorenarrowlyon aggressiveinteractionsandto behave increasinglymoreaggressivelyA. similartypeofspiralingeffecthasrecent- ly beenpostulatedby Eron (1982)in describingthe long-termeffectsof ag- gressivetelevisionon children. As he states(p. 210), "althoughwe have demonstratedthat televisionviolenceis one causeof aggressivebehavior, it is alsoprobablethat aggressivechildrenpreferto watchmoreandmore television.The processis very likely circular." An increasedunderstanding of how this processworks holdspromisefor advancementisn the diagnosis and treatmentof aggressivechildren.
