Children’s Theory of Mind, Self-
Perceptions, and Peer Relations: A
Longitudinal Study

Sandra Leanne Bosacki*
Brock University, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada

This longitudinal study explored Theory of Mind (ToM), self-
perceptions, and teacher ratings of peer relations of 91 children
(52 females, ages 6–8 years) drawn from two schools situated in a
mainly Euro-Canadian, middle socioeconomic status, semi-rural
central Canadian context. ToM, self-perceptions, and teacher rat-
ings of peer relations were assessed at Time 1 (T1, M = 6 y 2 m)
and 2 years later at Time 2 (T2, M = 8 y 5 m). Findings showed that
ToM scores and perceptions of global self-worth and physical
appearance signiﬁcantly increased with time across both genders.
Positive longitudinal associations were found between teacher
ratings of sociable peer relations at T1 and children’s T2 moral
self-perceptions. A positive longitudinal correlation was found
between T1 ToM and T2 teacher ratings of anxious/fearful peer
relations. Individual variation in ToM at age 6 predicted teacher rat-
ings of anxious and fearful behaviours in 8 year olds. In contrast,
teacher ratings at age 6 did not predict ToM ability in 8 year olds.
Educational implications for social and emotional competencies

Key words: Theory of Mind; self-perceptions; peer relations; childhood

Across educational and psychological research domains, there has been a rise in
the interest in the emotional and social aspects of learning (Bruner, 1996; Rubin,
Burgess, & Coplan, 2002). Increasingly, recent research with young school children
shows that peer relations and sociability may play a signiﬁcant role in children’s
socioemotional and cognitive development (Rubin & Burgess, 2001). In contrast
to sociable behaviours in the classroom that have been found to be related to
positive social and cognitive development (Rubin & Burgess, 2001), research on
social inhibition or the tendency to be fearful and anxious in challenging or novel
social situations remains sparse, especially longitudinal research that explores
changes over time during childhood (Mink, Henning, & Aschersleben, 2014).
Despite the theoretical and practical implications of investigating the inner and

social world of the socially inhibited child, empirical support for the links among
children’s social inhibition and their ability to understand thoughts and emotions
in self and others or Theory of Mind (ToM), as well as their feelings of self-worth,
remains sparse, and existing ﬁndings are inconsistent and variable (Hughes, 2011;
Pons et al., 2004).

Thus, the main purpose of this research was to explore relations among
ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations in Canadian school-aged children.
In particular, building on psychocultural and social ecological
theories of
self-system and social behaviour (Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006; Carpendale
& Lewis, 2004; Maccoby, 1998), this research explores teachers’ perceptions
regarding the socio-communicative competence and peer relations of children
in their classrooms. Moreover, given past research that suggests advanced
ToM and particular anxious and fearful behaviours may be less tolerated
and more problematic for young males than for young females (Akseer, Bosacki,
Rose-Krasnor, & Coplan, 2014; Rubin & Coplan, 2004; Walker, 2005), gender
differences were also explored.

Theory of Mind, Self-Concept and Socioemotional Competence
Although social inhibition is often deﬁned as the reluctance to engage in interper-
sonal interactions (Kagan & Snidman, 2004), it may also imply a metacognitive or
evaluative component. For example, the relation between shyness and social
anxiety or embarrassment suggests an evaluation of the self against some kind of
ideal self (Lewis, 1995). This often negative evaluation component may be linked
to metacognitive factors such as the ability to reﬂect on one’s own thinking and
self-image, in addition to various social–cultural factors such as gender and ethnicity.
Regarding the concept of self within middle childhood, although the literature
on children’s self-concept development is vast and beyond the scope of this article
(see Bruner, 1996; Marshall, Parker, Ciarrochi, & Heaven, 2014), for the purpose of
this study, we have chosen to work within a developmental, psychocultural, and
social ecological framework that deﬁnes the self as a multidimensional construct
that involves different aspects of oneself such as one’s physical appearance and
body image, behavioural conduct, social acceptance, academic competence, and
an overall
feeling of global self-worth or a perceived personal happiness
(Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006; Harter, 1996). This self-system is also described
by some as a dynamic, ﬂuid process that is co-created within conversation and
social context (Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Markus & Kitayama, 1994). Children’s
views of themselves as human beings, and also of a particular gender, are trans-
mitted and reinforced by various social agents including family, peers, and the
mass media. For example, research shows that comments from role models such
as parents and teachers may inﬂuence children’s self-perceptions and attitudes
concerning moral behaviour, physical appearance, and peer relations (Maccoby,
1998; Spilt, van Lier, Leﬂot, Onghena, & Coplin, 2014).

Few studies examine the longitudinal associations among children’s ToM,
self-perceptions, and peer relations within the school context during the ages
of 6–10 years or middle childhood (Banerjee & Henderson, 2001; Bosacki,
2000; Hughes, 2011). Developmentally, middle childhood often involves the
increasing complexity of the school environment that represents children’s
interactions with teachers, peers, and others (Harter, 1996; Stipek, Recchia, &
McClintic, 1992). The social experiences during this time provide children with
an opportunity to co-create different selves through their interactions with

their peers, parents, and teachers (Bruner, 1996; Spilt et al., 2014; Wright &
Mahfoud, 2014). Given this complex social context of the school environment,
and the possible inﬂuence of peers and teachers on children’s self-perceptions,
children’s ToM ability may also inﬂuence how they relate to their peers. For
example, past research suggests that how children view and feel about
themselves as well as think about others’ minds may have an inﬂuence on
how they understand and relate to their peers (Bosacki, 2000; Spilt et al.,
2014; Verschueren, Buyck, & Marooen, 2001). More speciﬁcally, past research
has shown that children with a more advanced ToM may be more sensitive
to helpful and harmful comments from their peers and teachers (Hughes,
2011; Lecce, Caputi, & Hughes, 2011).

Despite the claims that suggest some young females may possess a less coherent
and positive self-theory than some young males (Maccoby, 1998), and the empiri-
cal evidence that preschool-aged girls show more frequent mental state talk than
boys (Fivush, 1989; Hughes, Deater-Deckard, & Cutting, 1999; Hughes & Dunn,
1999), differential gender links between self-cognitions and peer relations,
especially regarding socially inhibited children during middle childhood, have
not yet been studied in depth. For example, although little is known about the
gendered connections among socially inhibited children’s ToM, perceptions of self,
and peer relations during the middle childhood years (Banerjee & Henderson,
2001), few of the studies that exist suggest that advanced ToM may be associated
with socially anxious behaviours in children (Wellman, Lane, LaBounty, & Olson,
2011), especially males (Walker, 2005). Thus, this study aimed to examine the
role of gender and age in the links among children’s ToM, self-perceptions,
and peer relations.

Gendered Relations among Children’s Theory of Mind, Self-Perceptions,
and Peer Relations
Teachers play a crucial role in both the gender role socialization and co-construction
of children’s social–cognitive and linguistic abilities (Arbeau & Coplan, 2007; Purkey,
2000; Spilt et al., 2014). Although there has been a growing interest in research on the
associations among ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations (Hughes, 2011; Lalonde
& Chandler, 1995; Villanueva Badenes, Clemente Estevan, & Garcia Bacete, 2000),
surprisingly, few researchers have studied the links among teachers’ perceptions of
children’s peer relations, children’s self-perceptions, and their ToM. In general, the
empirical evidence on the role of gender in ToM remains inconsistent, as past
research has found that girls outperform boys in ToM and emotion understanding
tasks and receive higher emotional competence teacher ratings (Cutting & Dunn,
1999), as do middle-school children (Bybee, 1998) and adults (Brody, 1999). Although
researchers have claimed that some young females seem to internalize earlier and
more completely the message that it matters how people feel, some studies have
demonstrated either that no gender differences exist in emotion competence
(Banerjee & Yuill, 1999) or that school-aged males outperform females (Laible &
Thompson, 1998).

The Present Study
This study aimed to investigate the association between children’s developing
social cognitions, particularly ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations. For example,
global biases and deﬁcits in sociocognitive processing may contribute generally

towards peer relations and social adjustment (Hughes, 2011). More speciﬁcally, past
research on executive functioning suggests that differences in children’s emotional
regulatory and inhibitory control abilities may inﬂuence their ability to engage in
social interactions with their peers (Zelazo, 1998; Zelazo & Cunningham, 2007).
For example, socially anxious and fearful, asocial, and excluded children may
process social situations in similar ways to prosocial peers, but in the face of arousing
social situations, they may regulate their emotions in different ways (Denham, 1998;
Rubin et al., 2002). As suggested (Rubin, Chen, & Hymel, 1993; Wichmann, Coplan,
& Daniels, 2004), socially anxious Canadian children may evidence a social cognitive
performance rather than a competence deﬁcit.

To date, there remains little longitudinal research on the individual differences
among children’s ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations (Hughes, 2011), partic-
ularly within a Canadian context. Although some cross-sectional research suggests
that reciprocal relations may exist between teacher ratings of children’s social
behaviour, children’s self-perceptions, and ToM ability (Spilt et al., 2014; Walker,
2005), few studies move beyond cross-sectional studies and explore the directional
inﬂuences among ToM, self-perceptions, and social relations. Given this gap in the
literature, the present study focused on the role that gender and age play in
Canadian children’s ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations. Building on
previous literature that shows socially inhibited children may be more likely to
be more depressed, anxious, and hold more negative self-perceptions than their
prosocial age-mates (Rubin et al., 2002), the present study explored the longitudi-
nal associations among ToM ability, self-perceptions (global self-worth, physical
appearance, and behavioural conduct), and peer relations in Canadian school-
aged children. Given the limited prior evidence, we did not predict a priori that
an antecedent, consequence, or reciprocal model would exist, although given the
past research on children’s ToM and temperament (Mink et al., 2014) and
perceived self-worth and social support (Marshall et al., 2014), we predicted that
advanced ToM ability and low levels of perceived self-worth in 6 year olds may
predict teacher ratings of socially inhibited relations in 8 year olds.

This study also explored the role gender plays in the longitudinal associations
among ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations among 6- to 8-year-old Canadian
children over a period of 3 years. Based on past gendered peer relations and social
cognitive research (Crick & Nelson, 2002; Saarni, 1999), gender-related differences
in the ﬁndings were expected to reﬂect stereotypic gender role expectations. For
example, as past research suggests that socially inhibited young males are at
greater risk for socioemotional problems than young females (Coplan & Armer,
2005; Crick, 1996; Walker, 2005), this study explored the question of whether
gender would inﬂuence teachers’ ratings of students’ peer relations. Accordingly,
it was hypothesized that females compared with males would be rated by teachers
as more sociable, reported a more positive sense of moral self, or saw themselves
as more well-behaved. Similarly, it was hypothesized that longitudinal correla-
tional patterns would reﬂect age-related and gender-related differences among
children’s ToM, self-perceptions, and peer relations.

91 children (T1: 52 females, M = 6 y, 4 m; 39 males, M = 6 y, 3 m; T2: 44 females, 8
y 3 m; 29 males, 8 y 2 m) and their teachers (N = 8, females). Participants were
recruited from two schools during the years of 2003–2006 within a mainly
English-speaking, Euro-Canadian, middle socioeconomic status population,
in
central Canada. Given the present sample decreased by 18 participants from T1
(91) to T2 (73), possible reasons for attrition may have been due to various factors
such as family moves and school changes, as these remain the limitations of
longitudinal studies.

Measures

Second-order false belief task

Gleaned from past research, to assess advanced or second-order ToM un-
derstanding or understanding other’s mental states and emotions, adapted
versions of two brief vignettes consisting of two story characters were read
and enacted out with dolls with the participant. Based on past research
(Baron-Cohen, O’Riordan, Stone,
Jones, & Plaisted, 1999; Hughes, 2011),
stories consisted of misplaced object location scenarios in which participants were
asked, ‘Where does Y look for the Z, and where does X think that Y will look for
the Z and why?’ Responses were coded for incorrect/correct responses to mem-
ory check (two questions—0/1 pass/fail)—if participants correctly responded to
memory questions, they were asked the ﬁrst-order and second-order questions.
Responses were coded according to correct location (0/1), and justiﬁcations were
coded for mental state language content (0 = I don’t know, 1 = physical, e.g.,
‘Because she moved it’, 2 = psychological, e.g., ‘Because that is where she thought
it was.’). Scores ranged from 0 to 7 (Table 1). Randomly selected 25% of the
transcripts were coded by a second independent coder, resulting in an average
kappa of (.93) across the two stories.

Self-concept

To assess children’s perceptions of their competencies, subscales from Harter’s
(1985) Self-Perception Proﬁle for Children (SPPC) were used. Based on past litera-
ture (Bosacki, 2000; Harter, 1996), the present study focused on three aspects that
to children’s sense of self:
some researchers consider particularly relevant
perceived behavioural conduct (six items, e.g., ‘how well-behaved do you think
you are’, Cronbach’s alpha = .81), physical appearance (six items, e.g., ‘how
good-looking do you think you are’, Cronbach’s alpha = .79), and global self-worth
(six items, e.g., ‘how happy are you being who you are?’ Cronbach’s alpha = .89).

Teacher ratings of children’s social relational competencies

Standardized, psychometrically robust rating scales were used to assess
teachers’ ratings of children’s social behaviour with their peers observed within
the classroom. Borrowing from Cassidy and Asher’s (1992) teacher rating scale
(Child Behavior Scale), teachers were asked to rate children’s behaviour on sub-
scales taken from a larger 59-item, 3-point scale questionnaire. Teachers were
asked to rate students on adapted items from the subscales that reﬂected
dimensions of peer exclusion (seven items, e.g., ‘Ignores other peers in class’,
Cronbach’s alpha = .84), anxiety and fearfulness (four items, e.g., ‘Fearful of
peers’, Cronbach’s alpha = .87), asocial with peers (six items, e.g., ‘Prefers to play
alone’, Cronbach’s alpha = .89, Cronbach’s alpha for composite score = .86), and
sociability (seven items, e.g., ‘Cooperative with peers’, Cronbach’s alpha = .86).

Design and Procedure
Upon receiving ethical clearance from university and school ofﬁcials, this study
consisted of two stages, as data were collected at Time 1 (T1) and then 2 years later
at Time 2 (T2). At T1, data collection consisted of a group, in-class session where
children were group administered tasks regarding self-perceptions and an individ-
ually administered ToM task. Teachers completed the questionnaires individually,
during their own time, regarding children’s social behaviours and peer relations,
and demographic information pertaining to family socioeconomic status was
obtained through parent questionnaire. T2 occurred 2 years later, and the data
collection procedure was repeated in the same manner as in T1.

RESULTS

Descriptive Statistics of Main Variables and Mean Differences between
Time 1 and Time 2
Means and standard deviations are displayed in Table 1. Table 1 shows separate,
paired t-tests among children’s perceived physical appearance, behavioural
conduct, global self-worth, and teacher ratings for T1 (age 6) and T2 (age 8).
Examination of the means revealed some signiﬁcant differences between the two
groups (T1 and T2). The main results are summarized in the following section.

Table 1 shows that children’s ToM scores signiﬁcantly increased from T1 to T2,
reﬂecting that children at 6 years of age were more likely to score higher on ToM
tasks 2 years later. Results showed only one signiﬁcant difference in teacher ratings
of children’s peer relations across time; speciﬁcally, teachers’ ratings of exclusion-
ary behaviour among children increased across Times 1 and 2. That is, teachers
reported more exclusionary behaviours among 8 year olds (e.g., intentionally

excluding a child from a game, party, etc.) as compared with 6 year olds. Regarding
children’s self-perceptions, 6-year-old children’s perceptions of their behavioural
conduct decreased 2 year later. That is, children perceived themselves as less well-
behaved or less likely to follow school rules at 8 years of age compared with when
they were 6 years of age. In contrast, children’s perceptions of their physical appear-
ance and their global self-worth increased signiﬁcantly over the 2 years. That is,
compared with when they were 6 years of age, children reported higher ratings of
their physical appearance and overall happiness at 8 years of age. Results from the
paired t-tests revealed no signiﬁcant gender differences across all variables.

Cross-Sectional Correlations for Time 1 and Time 2 Main Variables
Regarding cross-sectional associations between teachers’ ratings of peer relations
and children’s perceived self-worth, for T1, no signiﬁcant correlations were found.
In contrast, for T2, signiﬁcant negative relations were found between teachers’ rat-
ings of anxious/fearful behaviour and children’s perceptions of global self-worth
or personal happiness, r(73) = .33, p = .04, and positive relations were found
between teachers’ ratings of sociability and children’s perceived moral self
or how well-behaved they perceived themselves to be, r(73) = .27, p = .02. A
signiﬁcant negative relation was found between T2 ToM and T2 global self-worth,
r(73) = .28, p = .02. This result suggested that the higher children scored on ToM,
the lower they rated their overall personal happiness.

Teachers’ Ratings of Peer Relations

the literature as to whether social inhibition should be conceptualized as either a
category to which one does or does not belong (Kagan & Snidman, 2004) or as a
dimension to which an individual varies on a continuum (see Crozier, 1995, for a
review), bivariate correlations were conducted on all teacher ratings of peer
relations as a continuous variable. Correlational analyses were conducted on the
female and male samples separately and showed similar correlational patterns
among main variables for females and males.

Table 2 shows a signiﬁcant positive correlation between children’s ToM at T1
and their teacher ratings of anxious/fearful behaviour at T2, r(89) = .47, p < .001.
That is, children who scored relatively higher on ToM at T1 subsequently received
higher teacher ratings of children’s anxious and fearful behaviours 2 years later at
T2. Interestingly, no correlations were found between T1 ToM and T1 anxious/
fearful behaviour, or between T2 ToM and T1 or T2 anxious/fearful behaviour.

Time 1 and Time 2 intercorrelations revealed no signiﬁcant differences between
self-perception measures or ToM scores. In contrast, signiﬁcant positive correla-
tions were found between three out of four of T1 and T2 teacher ratings of
children’s peer relations: T1–T2 sociability, r(73) = .35, p = .01; anxious/fearful,
r(73) = .37, p = .02; exclusion, r(73) = .38, p = .01. Teacher ratings of asociability
from T1 and T2 were not related, r(73) = .15, ns.

Regression Analyses
Given the signiﬁcant longitudinal bivariate correlations between T1 and T2, we
proceeded to conduct two regression analyses. Our ﬁrst aim was to test whether
ToM understanding at age 6 directly predicted teachers’ ratings of anxious and
fearful behaviour 2 years later. Secondly, we aimed to test whether teachers’ rat-
ings of anxious and fearful behaviour of 6-year-old children predicted 8-year-olds’
ToM understanding. Thus, we regressed teacher ratings of anxious/fearful
behaviour at age 8 on ToM scores of 6 year olds and covaried anxious/fearful
behaviour at age 6. We then followed the same procedure to test for the opposite
pathway: we regressed the ToM scores at age 8 on anxious and fearful behaviour
at age 6, and covaried ToM scores at age 6.

Table 3 illustrates the regression analysis that shows that individual differences in
children’s ToM understanding at age 6 signiﬁcantly predicted teachers’ ratings of
anxious and fearful behaviour at child age 8. That is, in this model, children’s ToM
ability at 6 years predicted teacher ratings of anxious and fearful behaviour at age
8 while controlling for teacher ratings of anxious and fearful behaviour at age 6.

In contrast, Table 4 shows that teacher ratings of anxious/fearful behaviour at
child age 6 did not signiﬁcantly predict children’s ToM understanding at age 8.

In the ﬁrst step at T1, we controlled for ToM at age 6 (covariate) and then added
teacher-rated anxious/fearful behaviour at age 6 in Step 2 of the equation. Table 4
shows that in this particular model, teacher ratings of anxious–fearful behaviour at
age 6 (controlling for ToM at age 6) did not account for a signiﬁcant percentage of
the variance in 8 year olds’ ToM.

DISCUSSION

This study explored the longitudinal associations among children’s ToM,
children’s self-perceptions, and teachers’ perceptions of peer relations. Findings
suggest that children’s ToM may be associated with their self-perceptions and
teachers’ perceptions of their peer relations over time. In particular, signiﬁcant
patterns of longitudinal associations were found among children’s ToM, global
self-worth, and teacher ratings of peer relations, especially anxious/fearful and
sociable behaviours. Regression analyses suggested that individual differences in
ToM ability at 6 years of age predicted teachers’ ratings of anxious and fearful
behaviour in 8 year olds. In addition, the signiﬁcant positive cross-sectional asso-
ciations between teacher ratings of sociability and children’s perceptions of their
moral self or behavioural conduct suggest that teachers’ and children’s percep-
tions of their social and moral behaviour are reciprocal and interdependent. In
contrast to our predictions, no signiﬁcant gender differences were found among
patterns of associations between children’s ToM, self-perceptions, and teacher
ratings of peer relations. The theoretical and educational implications of these
ﬁndings are discussed later.

Relations among Teachers’ Perceptions of Children’s Peer Relations, Self-Perceptions,
and Theory of Mind
Although no longitudinal relations between teachers’ perceptions of children’s
peer relations and children’s self-perceptions were found, cross-sectional correla-
tions for T2 when participant were 8 years of age showed that signiﬁcant negative
relations were found between teachers’ ratings of anxious and fearful behaviour
and children’s perceptions of global self-worth or personal happiness. In addition,
positive relations were found between teachers’ ratings of sociability and
children’s perceived moral self or how well-behaved they viewed themselves.

Overall, these ﬁndings are also consistent with past research that suggests
teachers’ expectations and beliefs of students may inﬂuence students’ self-
perceptions and behaviours within the classroom (Curtis & Altmann, 1977;
Purkey, 2000; Spilt et al., 2014). However, as the present results illustrate, children’s

perceptions and teacher ratings were not always in agreement, and this lack of
concordance needs to be addressed in future research, as this difference in perceptions
may have implications for students’ learning (Walker, 2005).

How do we explain the ﬁndings that teachers’ perceptions of children’s peer
relations, especially regarding sociability and anxious/fearful behaviour, may
inﬂuence or be inﬂuenced by children’s perceptions of self-worth? From a
psychocultural and social ecological perspective, these ﬁndings could be explained
in terms of the Pygmalion effect or the inﬂuence of self-fulﬁlling prophesy (Purkey,
2000). For example, if a teacher perceived a child to be sociable, it may be possible
that the child could apply that label of ‘social’ to herself or himself, and may thus
gradually integrate this label of social into their self-concept. Consequently, the
child may behave in more social ways, which in turn may reinforce the teacher’s
original perception of a sociable child. Alternatively, given that teachers were
rating ‘sociability’ and children were rating their self-perceived moral behaviours,
both could have been assessing classroom conduct and sociable behaviour, as this
conceptual similarity may also have led to positive associations. Overall, this
positive association between teachers’ peer relation ratings and children’s self-
perceptions of their classroom behaviour suggests that reciprocal relation between
teacher labels and student behaviour requires future research to examine the
inﬂuence of teachers’ perceptions on children’s self-concepts and peer relations.

The present ﬁndings suggest that complex connections exist among children’s
ToM ability, perceived self-worth, and teacher ratings of peer relations. Such ﬁnd-
ings support previous research that social interactions may play signiﬁcant roles in
children’s ToM understanding (Cutting & Dunn, 1999). Although the lack of
gender-related differences contrasts with past research that has shown school-aged
girls score higher than boys on ToM and emotion understanding, particularly the
complex, moral emotions (Bybee, 1998; Cutting & Dunn, 1999), the present ﬁnd-
ings contribute to the growing body of contradictory empirical evidence regarding
gender-related differences in social cognitive development and peer relations in
middle childhood (Hughes, 2011)

Our ﬁndings also support the notion that perhaps sophisticated or advanced
ToM understanding may have intrapersonal and interpersonal costs and beneﬁts
(Cutting & Dunn, 1999; Sutton, Smith, & Swettenham, 1999). In particular, the posi-
tive predictive relation between children’s ToM at 6 years of age and their teacher rat-
ings of anxious/fearful behaviour at 8 years of age suggests that the ability to
understand others’ thoughts and emotions may have implications for social and peer
behaviour in later childhood. For example, regarding interpersonal implications,
children with a highly advanced emotional understanding ability may also use this
ability to either help (e.g., befriend someone) or harm others (e.g., excluding a peer
from a group by developing a friendship with someone else; Schneider, 1999; Sutton
et al., 1999). In addition, children with advanced ToM ability may be more sensitive
to the non-verbal and ambiguous messages from others regarding social interactions
and may thus feel more anxious and worried in social situations (Hughes, 2011;
Mink et al., 2014).

Such ﬁndings suggest that children’s self-perceptions may be inﬂuenced by
teacher ratings of academic competence and support the claim that a sophisticated
ability to understand mental states and emotions in others may have some psycho-
logical costs as well as beneﬁts. That is, some children may be more sensitive to
teachers’ criticisms as compared with other children who do not have such a
well-developed ability (Hughes, 2011; Lecce et al., 2011). Although our study did
not ﬁnd that teacher ratings of fearful and anxious behaviour in 6 year olds inﬂu-
enced their ToM 2 years later, further research needs to explore the connections and

dynamic interplay between ToM and teacher ratings of social behaviour, particu-
larly anxious and fearful behaviours (Wright & Mahfoud, 2014).

Relatedly, the present ﬁndings that showed for 8 year olds only, negative
relations were found between children’s ToM and their perceptions of global
self-worth. This result supports past research that shows relations between chil-
dren’s advanced ToM and negative self-perceptions (Bosacki, 2000), and suggests
that the higher children scored on ToM, the lower they rated their overall personal
happiness. In contrast, the lower children scored on ToM, the higher they rated
their personal happiness. As Dunn (2002) suggested, a child’s ability to under-
stand someone’s emotional state does not necessarily inform us of how that child
may choose to behave socially. In addition, children who develop a sophisticated
ability to understand the thoughts and emotions in others may be more likely than
children who do not develop such an advanced understanding to be more sensi-
tive and vulnerable to the subtle or nuanced judgements and evaluations of others.

Implications and Future Directions
Given the limitations of the present study (e.g., correlational design, lack of general
language measure, and ethnically homogeneous sample), interpretations of the
present ﬁndings are to be made with caution. Given the co-construction of chil-
dren’s ToM, self-concept, and peer relations, paper-and-pencil tasks such as the
SPPC and teacher reports are unlikely to capture such a dynamic and complex
process. In addition, the particular family structure such as number of siblings,
cultural and socio-economic family history, and the content of the psychological lan-
guage used between children and their parents may have inﬂuenced the children’s
ToM and social cognitive and relational functioning (Ensor, Devine, Marks, &
Hughes, 2014). Future studies should include further detail on the psychological con-
tent (cognition and emotion words) used in the language of siblings and parents, in
addition to the language teachers use in the classroom, as such vocabulary could
have an inﬂuence on children’s developing ToM, self-perceptions, and social adjust-
ment. Future studies could also provide more explicit training for teachers to report
socially inhibited and asocial behaviour in their students (Arbeau & Coplan, 2007),
and the addition of parental ratings of social inhibition and asociability would also
provide a more accurate description of a child’s behaviours in the school and home.
Given the important role teachers play in children’s social and emotional lives,
this study may encourage future research on socially inhibited children’s ToM,
self-concept, and peer relations to include observational measures in naturalistic
settings and in-depth discourse analysis of peer conversations within the school
context. Consequently, researchers and educators need to draw from psycho-
linguistic and cross-cultural literature (Lane et al., 2013; Vinden, 1999), and begin
to integrate a variety of language tasks (receptive and expressive) into social
cognitive and peer relations research with children across various cultures. Such
research may provide the necessary empirical evidence for the development of
educational programmes aimed to promote ToM and self-talk skills as a means
of coping with social anxiety and aggression in the classroom.
