Abstract

There is considerable interest in the role of mental state language in theory of mind
development. This study examines cognitive and desire state discourse of 43 mothers
during play interactions with their two-year-old children and theory of mind as
indicated by a battery of false belief tasks around the age of ﬁve. Desire state comments
of mothers during free play which were appropriate to the conversational context were
signiﬁcantly related to children’s later theory of mind, and this relation was indepen-
dent of other confounding variables, including a home-based measure of maternal
sensitivity, and socio-economic status, and an estimate of child language. The child’s
desire state language was concurrently related to the mother’s desire state language
used appropriately, and the child’s cognitive state language was related to the mother’s
appropriate cognitive state language. Although cognitive state language was not pre-
dictive of later theory of mind, this may be because this kind of language plays a later
role in theory of mind development.

There has been recent attention to the role of social discourse in theory of mind (ToM)
development (Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Harris, 1999; Meins, 1997; Symons, 2004).
Discourse about the thoughts, desires and feelings of self and others has been proposed
to be fundamental to children’s social understanding and pivotal to their entry into a
community of minds (Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Tesla & Youngblade, 1991; Nelson,
Plesa Skwerer, Goldman, Henseler, Presler & Walkenfeld, 2003). Although a variety of
interactional contexts have been examined (e.g., Brown, Donelan–McCall & Dunn,
1996), a large proportion of this research has emphasized the importance of discourse
in social interactions between children and parents, often within a Vygotskian frame-
work (e.g., Vygotsky, 1978, 1986).

The social-constructivist approach to ToM development proposes that talk about
beliefs and desires in parent–child interactions leads to self–other understanding, and
most recently, this has been proposed to be through communication within epistemic
triangles (Carpendale & Lewis, 2004), dialogic exchanges between parents and children
(Fernyhough & Meins, 2004) and the internalization of social understanding (Symons,

2004). As evidence, longitudinal research has shown that discourse about mental states
with peers (Hughes & Dunn, 1998) and parents (e.g., Meins, Fernyhough, Wainwright,
Das Gupta, Fradley & Tukey, 2002; Ruffman, Slade & Crowe, 2002) predicts the later
ToM of children as indicated by their performance on standard false belief tasks. Social
understanding encompasses much more than passing false belief tasks, but these kinds
of tasks are accepted as indicators that a child can understand that their thoughts and
feelings can differ from either those of another or what the child herself or himself
has experienced at another time (see Flavell, 2000; Slaughter & Repacholi, 2003).
Although there is general acceptance that ToM skills transform and/or are transformed
by children’s close relationships and language communities, speciﬁc developmental
pathways remain unclear, particularly in toddlerhood (see Hughes & Leekham, 2004).
The tendency to engage in mental state discourse may be an individual difference
variable of parents. For example, Meins (1997) developed the concept of maternal
mind-mindedness as the tendency for mothers to focus on the mental attributes of their
children as opposed to behavioural and physical characteristics, and proposed that
mind-mindedness is a component of parental discourse style related to a child’s
mentalizing ability, which ultimately becomes reﬂected in their ToM. Meins and
colleagues (Meins et al., 2002; Meins, Fernyhough, Wainwright, Clark-Carter, Das
Gupta, Fradley et al., 2003) have shown that mind-minded parenting in the ﬁrst year of
life predicts the ToM of children four years later, even controlling for later mind-
minded parenting, security within the relationship, and global sensitivity. Similarly,
Peterson and Slaughter (2003) described the different communication styles mothers
felt that they used with their children. They showed that elaborating upon mental states
during conversations with children was related to children’s false belief performance,
but mental state language without explanation was not related to it.

Several issues arise within this research that serve as motivation for the current
study. Firstly, it is important to recognize that the simple exposure of children to mental
state language seems less important than the didactic use of mental state language in
an appropriate interactional context. Contextual information has typically been incor-
porated into coding schemes by examining the mental state discourse of parents that
ﬁts with a current activity or child mental states. Appropriate mental state discourse
was deﬁned by Meins et al. (2003) as when a mother correctly reads an infant’s
psychological state, behavioural activity, or knows how to proceed if there is a lull in
the interaction. In their study, it was appropriate mind-minded comments that predicted
later ToM, not comments that were not appropriate to the infant’s mental state or
activity. However, because the children were only six months old in the Meins et al.
(2003) study, the judgement of appropriateness was not based on child language, but
instead, on inferences of infant behaviour and intent. By contrast, two-year-old toddlers
were examined in the current study at a time when they had emergent language skills,
and the appropriateness of maternal mental state language could therefore be judged
primarily on the linguistic responses of the children during play interactions. The
elaboration of child mental states by parents (Peterson & Slaughter, 2003) implies that
the parents are in tune with the child’s communicative meaning when the parents,
themselves, use mental state language in collaborative conversations (see Dunn, 2005;
Nelson et al., 2003).

Secondly, longitudinal studies have not considered the potentially different roles that
discourse about beliefs and desires play in later ToM. Bartsch and Wellman (1995)
found that parents’ language about desire states was a stronger predictor of their
children’s later talk about thoughts and knowledge than the parents’ earlier language

about belief states. In another example, Ruffman et al. (2002) examined mental state
language during parent–child discussions of a wordless storybook when children were
three, 3.4 and four years of age, and found that the mothers desire state language was
a better predictor of later child language about thoughts and knowledge than earlier
mother think and know language. Home-based naturalistic observations of mental state
talk have also been examined for developmental changes in children and their parents.
Jenkins, Turrell, Kogushi, Lollis and Ross (2003) examined families when the younger
siblings were aged two and four, and the older siblings were aged four and six, and
found that regardless of the age transition, mothers used relatively more desire talk and
less cognitive talk at the younger ages, but this pattern reversed itself at the older ages.
In addition, children’s talk about the cognitive states at time 2 was predicted by similar
talk by family members and general child language at time 1, even when earlier
children’s talk about cognitive states was controlled. However, this pattern was present
only for children ages two to four and not for the older children, and there was no
evidence that early exposure to desire talk predicted later cognitive state talk.

Both beliefs and desires have typically been aggregated together into a single
category of mental state language, but young children may develop an understanding
of desire states before belief states (Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982; Moore, Furrow,
Chiasson, & Patriquin, 1994). Accordingly, there may be differential predictions of
belief and desire state language to later ToM. For example, Ruffman et al. (2002)
predicted that children’s social understanding is rooted initially in the desire state talk
of mothers, which becomes scaffolded into belief state talk later during the preschool
period, but they note that there are no data around the age of two addressing this
hypothesis. The current study ﬁlls this void by separately examining the longitudinal
relations of both belief and desire state language at this age to later ToM, taking the
conversational context of such language into consideration.

A third issue is that it is possible that discourse about mental states is simply a
characteristic of a parenting style that is generally sensitive, and interactions that are
harmonious. It is therefore important to show that discourse predicts later ToM above
and beyond a parenting style that is sensitive (see Harris, 2005; Thompson, 1997). The
Meins et al. (2003) study used a global rating scale—the Ainsworth nine-point
scales—to assess maternal sensitivity, which, they note, is not behaviourally based,
despite the use of descriptive anchors (see Hurst & Meins, 2004). In the current study,
intensive Q-sort home-based observations of maternal sensitivity are therefore included
(see Pederson, Moran, Sitko, Campbell, Ghesquire & Acton, 1990; Symons, 2001) to
address the alternative hypothesis that general sensitivity accounts for the relations
between mental state discourse and later ToM. Other parental characteristics are also
important to consider. Some studies (e.g., Cutting & Dunn, 1999; Pears & Moses, 2003)
have shown that maternal education and income, which are both components of
socioeconomic status (SES), are related to some aspects of the ToM in preschool
children, although relations with belief tasks are inconsistent. It is also possible that
these demographics are related to general child language skills, given that child
language development can be relatively more advanced in high SES homes.

In the current study, developmental relations between mental state discourse during
parent–child play interactions when the children were two years of age, and their ToM
around the age of ﬁve were examined. Belief and desire state language of each
interactant was coded, and comments made by the mothers were further classiﬁed as to
whether they were appropriate to ongoing child activity and mental states. These
interactions took place during a laboratory visit, and in addition, home-based Q-sort

observations of maternal sensitivity were made at this age. Discourse measures at the
age of two were related to their ToM assessed with a battery of false belief tasks at time
2 around the age of ﬁve. It was hypothesized that the desire state language by the mothers
during play at time 1 would predict the children’s ToM at time 2, even when maternal
sensitivity, child language and, the variation in child age at the latter observation time
were taken into consideration. However, no directional predictions were made about
cognitive state language, given suggestions that this kind of language is developmentally
signiﬁcant in relatively older preschool-age children.

Method

Participants

The participants were 43 mothers and their children (23 boys, 20 girls) from a previous
study on attachment security and ToM (Symons & Clark, 2000). The mother–child
pairs were seen at time 1 when the children were two years of age, M = 24.7, SD = 1.0,
range = 23 to 27 months, and again at time 2 when the children were aged four to six
years, M = 69.2 months, SD = 4.2. The age range of the total sample at time 2 was 54
to 81 months, however, all but three children were 63 to 74 months of age, and 34 of
43 (79 per cent) of children were ﬁve years old.

Fifteen (35 per cent) of the children were ﬁrst born. Thirty (70 per cent) had at least
one sibling at time 1, and 40 (93 per cent) had a sibling by time 2. At time 1, 40 (90 per
cent) mothers were married to the child’s father, one (2 per cent) was living in a
common-law relationship, and two (5 per cent) were single parents.

At time 1 and 2 visits, 33 (77 per cent) and 30 (70 per cent) respectively of the
mothers were employed outside the home for at least 20 hours a week. The SES of the
families was based on the Blishen Scale, which is a Canadian SES index (Blishen,
Carroll & Moore, 1987). This index assigns numbers to speciﬁc job titles based on
years of education, income and the social status associated with an occupation, and
scores range from a possible 17 to 101. Because Blishen scores are based on job titles,
no scores are provided for unemployed individuals, so the SES was recalculated on a
scale of one to ﬁve in which low scores indicated a low SES (see Fahie & Symons,
2003). The classiﬁcations were as follows: (1) nine families in which parent(s) were
either unemployed or in seasonal or unskilled labour profession, Blishen < 30 (e.g.,
farmhand); (2) nine families in which one parent was in a skilled-labour profession (3)
10 families in which two parents were in skilled-labour professions (e.g., construction,
ﬂoor installation, mechanic); (4) 10 families in which one parent was in a mid- to high
SES category (e.g., manager, real estate sales, teacher, psychologist) and (5) ﬁve
families in which two parents were in mid- to high SES category. In both items (2) and
(3) the Blishen score is 30 to 50 and in both items (4) and (5) the Blishen score is >50.
In this way, all the families received an SES score regardless of their employment status
and family make up, and a wide SES range was represented.

Measures

Mental State Language During Play Observations. At time 1, the mothers were asked
to play with their toddler in a laboratory setting outﬁtted with toys appropriate for
two-year-old children. This 10-minute interaction was videotaped and transcribed. In
addition to verbal utterances, physical gestures indicating overt communicative actions
were noted (e.g., nods of agreement, pointing at toys).

Two independent raters event-coded the transcripts for instances of mental state
language based on recent coding schemes (Meins et al., 2003; Ruffman et al., 2002;
Symons, Peterson, Slaughter, Roche & Doyle, 2005). The categories of mental state
language were cognitive states, desire states and affect emotion states. Cognitive state
terms were coded if they involved processing information mentally and included the use
of the words, ‘think’, ‘believe’, ‘remember’, ‘dream’, ‘imagine’, ‘know’, ‘forget’ and
‘wonder’. Utterances were coded as desire state terms if the mother or child expressed
a desire, want, need, wish, or said they were missing someone. Utterances were coded as
affect state terms any time the mother referred to any kind of basic emotion, including,
‘happy’, ‘sad’, ‘unhappy’, ‘feel’(when it was used to indicate an emotion, e.g., feel bad),
‘angry’, ‘hate’, ‘love’, ‘like’ (e.g., I like you), ‘afraid’, ‘scared’, ‘worry’, ‘enjoy’,
‘interested’, ‘hurt’, ‘sorry’, ‘surprised’, ‘pleased’ and ‘excited’. The child used so little
of this kind of language that affect terms were not coded for children.

Similar to other schemes, ‘think’ responses which were vague and could indicate a
yes or no answer, rather than a true reference to a cognitive event (e.g., ‘I think so’)
were not coded as mental state terms. Also, ‘know’ comments that consisted only of the
words, ‘I don’t know’, were not coded as mental state terms as this phrase does not
indicate what is unknown and may simply be another way of stating ‘I can’t answer’.
Repeated utterances (e.g., ‘I know, I know’) were coded as a single mental state term,
and the repetition was not coded.

The mental state utterances of the children and mothers were coded separately, and
data consisted of frequency counts of certain kinds of mental state language. Frequency
counts, as opposed to proportions of total talk, were used based on Ruffman et al.’s.
(2002) argument that each word used by parents and children may have a direct impact
on the child’s ToM development, more so than density measures of language that
proportional measures would represent. These authors argue that, just as having more
older siblings and spending more time with people older than the child have been found
to positively inﬂuence ToM abilities (that is likely through an increased exposure to
mentalistic language). The increased use of mental state terms by parents could also
plausibly affect ToM abilities regardless of whether or not it is simply a function of the
verbosity of parents. Regardless, the mother’s total number of words was also counted
for the play session as a whole to address parental verbosity.

The mother’s cognitive and desire state terms were further coded for appropriate-
ness following criteria modelled after Meins et al.’s (2002) criteria for ‘appropriate
mind-related comments’. Mother appropriate cognitive state terms and appropriate
desire state terms were coded as when mothers used a cognitive and desire state
term, respectively, and the child’s speech or behaviour was consistent with her or his
mother’s interpretation of the child’s mental state. For example, if a mother asked
her child if she or he wanted to do a particular activity and the child responded that
she or he did want to do that activity, or her or his behaviour was consistent with
such a desire, then the mother’s comment was coded as appropriate. The mother’s
comments were also coded as appropriate if she linked the child’s current activity to
similar events or activities in the future or in the past (e.g., ‘Do you remember seeing
the cows on the way here?’ ‘Yes’, says the child) and the child’s behaviour or speech
indicated that they were following the mother’s speech (‘Do you want the book?’
‘Book’, says the child). The three forms of child behaviour that therefore led to a
mother’s mental state comment being classiﬁed as appropriate were repeating all or
part of the mother’s phrase, answering a question with other relevant words, or
indicating agreement.

The mother’s utterances were coded as inappropriate if an independent coder judged
that the child’s behaviour or speech indicated that the mother’s comment was not
consistent with her or his mental state (e.g., asking ‘Do you want to play with the ball?’
followed by the child responding that she or he did not want to play with the ball or
indicating that she or he desired to play with a toy which, was not the ball). The
mother’s mental state comments were also coded as inappropriate if she referred to a
future or past event that was not obviously related to the child’s current activity, or the
child was unresponsive to the mother’s comment. The three forms of child behaviour
that therefore led to a mother’s mental state comment being classiﬁed as not appro-
priate were answering in a contrary fashion using other words, indicating disagree-
ment, or being unresponsive to the mother.

Coding was at comparable base rates between two coders and inter-rater reliability
was high for all mental state terms for each interactant, all rs > .98, as well as
appropriateness of mother’s use of cognitive and affective desire mental state
language, rs > .91. The mother total number of words were counted in a word process-
ing package after a review to ensure that any non-verbal notations in the transcript were
removed.

Children’s Language. An estimate of language ability of the two-year-old children in
this study could be determined from an analysis of language during the play interac-
tion. The mean length utterance (MLU) was calculated according to the speciﬁcations
of Brown (1973), who described how the number of morphemes could be calculated
for each full utterance within a transcript in a standardized fashion (see also Berko
Gleason & Bernstein Ratner, 1998; Shatz & Gelman, 1973). An utterance was deﬁned
as a conversational turn in the play transcript that could be either a complete sentence
or a conversational phrase. Morphemes are basic units of meaning, and utterances were
coded for the total number of morphemes within each utterance. In keeping with MLU
coding rules, single morphemes were coded for compound words indicating a single
functional noun (e.g., kitty-cat, moo-cow) as well as repetitions (e.g., no, no, no) when
not used for emphasis. Separate morphemes were coded for all inﬂections such as
possessives, plurals and regular past tense.

Two deviations from Brown (1973) were that a majority of play sessions did not
contain 100 utterances of the child upon which to base the estimate, so a reduced
number had to be used, M = 50.5, SD = 22.1, range = 6 to 112, and coding was of the
complete session rather than after either the ﬁrst page of transcription or a certain
number of conversational turns. The morpheme total was calculated as the total number
of morphemes uttered by the children during the 10-minute play session. This gave an
estimate of the verbosity of the children as a different estimate of language use. The
MLU was calculated as the average number of morphemes per utterance. Inter-
observer reliability based on 25 per cent of the dataset was high for both the MLU and
the morpheme total, both rs = .99.

Maternal Sensitivity. Two observers independently completed the maternal behaviour
Q-sort (MBQ) (Pederson et al., 1990) after the age two contact. The MBQ consists of
90 cards descriptive of maternal behaviour and is regarded as a measure of general
sensitivity constructed on Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, and Wall’s (1978) concept of
sensitive parenting. Some items relate to a mother’s ability to perceive, identify and
respond consistently and accurately to signals from her child. None of the items refers
to mental state language speciﬁcally, although attunement with the infant’s needs is

queried. The score obtained is a correlation between the sort descriptive of the
observed mother’s behaviour and a criterion sort of the proto-typically sensitive
mother according to experts in parent–child relationship research. High scores indicate
high sensitivity, that is, the behaviour is more like that of a prototypically sensitive
mother. MBQ scores were used for analyses from a randomly selected observer, and
this measure has concurrent validity with observational measures of attachment secu-
rity and other measures of sensitivity (see Pederson et al., 1990; Symons, 2001). MBQ
scores were found to be reliable in the current data, r(41) = .84, p < .001.

ToM

The theory of mind battery at time 2 included six unexpected identity and contents task
items (e.g., the Smarties task, Gopnick & Astington, 1988), and ﬁve changed location
tasks (see Symons, McLaughlin, Moore & Morine, 1997; Wimmer and Perner (1983).
In the six unexpected identity and contents tasks, the children were presented with
various objects whose true identity or contents were different from what seemed
apparent. The six items in the current study included: (1) an egg carton containing
forks rather than eggs, (2) a Smarties box containing rocks as opposed to Smarties, (3)
a candle that resembles an apple, (4) an eraser that looks like a marker, (5) a milk
carton containing water rather than milk and (6) a ﬂashlight that looks like a pen. Once
the true identity or contents were revealed, the children were asked a series of questions
regarding what another child would have initially believed the true identity or contents
to be (false belief), and what they themselves had initially thought the true identity or
contents to be (representational change). The children’s performance on false belief,
M = 81 per cent, and representational change, M = 52 per cent, questions was similar
to that reported elsewhere for similar aged children (see Symons et al., 1997; Wellman,
Cross & Watson, 2001). In order to pass the tasks, the children were required to answer
both the false belief and the representational change questions correctly, M = .47,
SD = .35, range = 0 to 1.0, a = .84, and scores for any items that were spontaneously
identiﬁed when initially presented were pro-rated.

The ﬁve changed location tasks involved the unexpected relocation of either a
desired object by a foil ‘playing a trick on the character’, or a caregiver by the caregiver
themselves. Changed location tasks involving objects are well known and are also
called Sally-Ann and Maxi tasks. The changed location tasks involving caregivers are
analogous, in that a story is acted out with Lego toys, in which a caregiver character is
doing something with the child-character, then goes off to another location for some
reason, and then, unknown to the child character, relocates to a different location. The
participant child then directs the search of the child character for the caregiver in either
the actual location or the location where the child character should think the caregiver
would be, with the latter choice indicating correct false belief understanding. Previous
research (Symons et al., 1997) has shown that changed location tasks involving
caregivers are more difﬁcult than those in which objects are the sought item. To pass
either kind of task, children were required to correctly search for the object or caregiver
in the original location, and correctly answer questions regarding where the target item
or person originally relocated to, where the target item or person now was, and whether
the child character was present for the transfer. Scores were calculated as the percent-
age of items passed, M = .63, SD = .27, range = .17 to 1.0, a = .51.

The overall ToM score consisted of an average of the two kinds of scores described
above. The overall ToM score had considerable variability, despite the fact that these

kinds of tasks typically show above-chance performance at this age, M = .55, SD = .24,
range = .13 to 1.0, a = .70. One child did not complete the ToM battery due to
scheduling problems.

Procedure

Each mother–child dyad was seen twice at each of times 1 and 2. At each age, visits
were scheduled within two weeks of each other. The contacts at time 1 consisted of a
laboratory visit during which the play interaction was videotaped, followed by a home
visit after which the MBQ was completed by the two observers. Due to travel restric-
tions in some cases, a single visit to a participant’s home was required to collect data
at a particular age.

In between these visits, the mothers completed a number of self-report question-
naires not relevant to this study (see Symons, 2001). The ToM battery was administered
in a randomly determined order during a laboratory visit at time 2.

Results

Descriptive statistics for the play observation data at time 1 can be found in Table 1.
The average number of words in the mothers’ utterances was over 700, and the average
number of morphemes uttered by the children was close to 80. There were very low
levels of mental state language for children, and the children used desire state terms
signiﬁcantly more than they used cognitive state terms, paired t(42) = 2.25, p < .05.
There were modest levels of cognitive and desire state words used by the mothers, and
both cognitive and desire state terms were more likely to be used by the mothers than
the children, paired ts(42) = 8.35 and 7.22, respectively, ps < .001. Maternal cognitive
and desire state language was also classiﬁed as appropriate about 33 per cent of the
time, although there was wide variability in these measures.

Bivariate intercorrelations were conducted of background variables, child language
measures and discourse measures. These are contained in Table 2. Child age at time 2
and their SES were not signiﬁcantly correlated with any of the dependent measures.

Relatively more generally sensitive mothers used more desire state terms classiﬁed as
appropriate and had more verbose children with a higher morpheme total. Children
with relatively more developed language according to MLU were more verbose, used
more desire state language and also had mothers whose desire state language was more
likely classiﬁed as appropriate. Children who were more verbose had mothers who
used more appropriate language of both cognitive and desire states.

There were a number of signiﬁcant intercorrelations between the language used by
the children and mothers during play. Children who used relatively more cognitive state
terms had mothers who used more cognitive state terms in an appropriate fashion, as
well as affect state terms. Children who used relatively more desire state language had
mothers who used more desire state language in an appropriate fashion. However,
cross-correlations were not signiﬁcant between the child’s desire state language and
the mother’s appropriate cognitive state language, nor the child’s cognitive state
language and the mother’s appropriate desire state language. These results suggest
some discriminant patterns of communicative style in at least the observed interaction,
and possibly the didactic style as a whole.

Finally, bivariate correlations were conducted between ToM and background vari-
ables, child language measures and discourse measures. Table 2 shows that ToM was
positively associated with the mother’s appropriate desire state language, but not her
appropriate cognitive state language, nor any other dependent measures. There were no
signiﬁcant relations between the ToM and background variables, although there was a
trend for the ToM to be associated to the MLU of children.

Mothers who used more desire state language classiﬁed as appropriate at time 1 had
children with higher ToM scores at time 2, but it is possible that this relationship was
due to shared variance with other background variables and child language. A hierar-
chical regression was conducted in which the background variables of the child’s age,
SES, and maternal sensitivity were entered at step 1, the child’s language measures of
MLU and morpheme total were entered at step 2, and then the maternal desire state
language classiﬁed as appropriate was entered in step 3. These results are shown in
Table 3. Neither background variables at step 1 nor the child language measures at step
2 accounted for a signiﬁcant proportion of the variance of later ToM scores. However,
the maternal appropriate desire state language accounted for an additional 11 per cent
of the variance in the ToM scores, and at step 3, a total of 19 per cent of the variance
was accounted for.

It is possible that child desire state language accounted for their ToM performance
rather than maternal appropriate desire state language, particularly as these two lan-
guage measures were positively related. The above regression was rerun with the child
desire state language as an additional predictor at step 3.This did not affect the additional
variance accounted for by this step nor the total variance accounted for by this step: those
numbers were identical. However, this overall regression equation was not signiﬁcant
after step 3, F(2,34) = 2.31, p = .11, and neither child, b = -.037, t = -.152, p = .88, nor
maternal appropriate, b = .423, t = 1.67, p = .10, desire state language were signiﬁcant
predictors of later ToM, although trends for the latter were similar to Table 3.

A number of other regression equations were run to investigate other potential
patterns. The same hierarchical regression of Table 3 was run with maternal verbosity
as an additional control variable entered at step 2, and the pattern of results did not
change. When the regression was rerun with maternal appropriate cognitive state
language only at step 3, this equation was not signiﬁcant. When this regression was
rerun with both maternal appropriate cognitive and desire state language entered at step
3, appropriate desire state language continued to be a signiﬁcant predictor of the ToM,
p < .05, although this step only accounted for an additional 12 per cent of the variance,
p < .10, and the overall equation only accounted for 20 per cent of the total variance.
Finally, recall that there were three children with somewhat disparate ages at time 2 in
this sample. The regression of Table 3 was rerun on a subset of data with these three
age-outliers removed, and the pattern of ﬁndings was the same, if not stronger. In this
analysis, the overall equation accounted for 23 per cent of the variance, and the
maternal desire state comments that were appropriate accounted for 15 per cent of the
variance of children ToM at time 2.

Desire state comments of mothers were designated as ‘appropriate’ only when
children responded to them in certain ways. All appropriate and not appropriate desire
state comments were re-examined to determine what kind of child response to maternal
desire state language might be speciﬁcally associated with later child ToM. The three
forms of child behaviour which led to a mother’s mental state comment being classi-
ﬁed as appropriate were repeating all or part of the mother’s phrase, M = .60,
SD = 1.21, range = 0 to 6, answering a question with other words, M = .58, SD = 1.10,
range = 0 to 5, or indicating agreement such as by saying ‘yes’, M = 1.49, SD = 1.50,
range = 0 to 7. Later ToM was associated with maternal desire state comments desig-
nated as appropriate when children were either repeating the mother’s phrase,
r(42) = .45, p < .01, or answering questions with other words, r(42) = .30, p < .05, but
not simply agreeing with the mother, r(42) = -.12, p > .05.

None of the reasons for mother desire state comments to be designated as not
appropriate was signiﬁcantly related to children’s later ToM. In addition, none of the
same sub-classiﬁcations of maternal appropriate and not appropriate cognitive state
utterances was signiﬁcantly related to later ToM, which should not be surprising, given
that maternal cognitive state language was unrelated to later ToM.

Discussion

This longitudinal study examined mental state discourse during play interactions of
mothers and their two year-old children, and the children’s ToM around the age of ﬁve.
The hypothesis that the desire state language of mothers classiﬁed as appropriate to the
child’s ongoing activity and mental states would predict the later child ToM was
supported. Furthermore, this relation was independent of other factors known to be

Discourse and Theory of Mind

687

related to ToM, including an estimate of child language, SES, and generally sensitive
parenting of the mother. These ﬁndings are important
to social constructivist
approaches to ToM development in which early communicative experience about
mental states predicts the later performance on false belief tasks. The current ﬁndings
support a Vygotskian approach to ToM development as a function, in part, of social
transmission between parents and children (see Carpendale & Lewis, 2004; Meins
et al., 2003; Symons, 2004).

Unconditional counts of neither desire nor cognitive state words by mothers were
predictive of their later ToM, and the desire state language of mothers was only
predictive of their ToM when it was designated as appropriate. What is classiﬁed as
appropriate is her use of a desire word, and then an indication the child is agreeing or
following the ﬂow of conversation. Instances in which children either do not respond
to or disagree with what the mother is saying would not be coded as appropriate. It
seems plausible that the appropriate use of mental state language would make play
interactions relatively more didactic and sensitive to children’s existing mindsets.
There would be an attunement of parents to what their children are thinking, wanting,
or doing. Although related to generally sensitive parenting (e.g., Harris, 2005; Meins
et al., 2002, 2003), the prediction of later ToM is not due to general sensitivity as a third
variable. If the goal is for toddlers to begin to understand how desire states reﬂect
thoughts and inﬂuence behaviour, then parents need to correctly reﬂect a child’s
beginning understanding of desires and thoughts in order for social understanding to be
enhanced. This is similar to Fonagy, Steele, Steele, and Holder’s (1997) suggestion that
the mentalizing capacity and ToM of the child is enhanced by a caregiver who observes
and responds appropriately to moment-to-moment changes in a child’s mental states.
Mental states which are explained and elaborated upon are also more likely to be in
attunement with children’s thoughts and behaviour and to have an impact on the
children’s understanding of mental states (as in Harris, 2005; Peterson & Slaughter,
2003). Such attunement allows a child to learn the language of desire states by having
mothers provide the appropriate framework for mental activity within a conversation.
This may address the very complex question of why language may matter for ToM
development (see Astington & Baird, 2005).

The current study used three ways to classify child behaviour associated with
mother desire language designated as appropriate, and these classiﬁcations give
some indication of what kinds of desire state discourse are signiﬁcant. Recently,
Nelson (2005) has suggested that the adults around a child may attempt to read a
child’s mind and predict what she or he wants and how she or he feels. One of the
ways in which this can be manifested is by toddlers their imitating their mother’s
correct identiﬁcation of a want or desire (e.g., Mother: Do you want the kitty? Child:
Kitty). Another sequence is when toddlers answer a desire state question addressed
to them (e.g., Mother: What do you want to play with? Child: Kitty). The current
data suggest that both these forms of interchanges, which are dependent on both the
mother’s and child’s behaviour, are predictive of their later ToM. The current data
are therefore supportive of Nelson’s (2005) proposition that a form of imitation
could lead to children learning the language of mental states around the age of two.
However, the more simplistic response of simple agreement is not (e.g., Mother: do
you want the kitty? Child: Yes). Furthermore, any kind of discordant communication
in which the mother has not read the child’s desires correctly is not predictive of
their later ToM (e.g., Mother: Do you want to play with the kitty? Child: Book).
Misreading a child’s desire state is not being sensitive or in time with children’s

wishes (Harris, 2005). The current data thus provide some information on speciﬁc
kinds of interchanges within collaborative conversations predictive of later ToM
(e.g., Dunn, 2005; Nelson, 2005), at least within mother–toddler play interactions.
The current data stress how essential contextual information is within discourse.

The toddlers in the current study are so young that they are still learning to identify
the language of mental states, and this is necessary before a child can begin to
understand the discrepant mental state language necessary for false belief task perfor-
mance around the age of four. Human language emerges during the ﬁrst ﬁve years of
life at the same time that children begin to understand mental states (see Wellman et al.,
2001), and general language has been implicated as important for ToM (e.g., Astington
& Jenkins, 1999). There have also been important demonstrations of relations between
the parents’ desire and cognitive state language with the later cognitive state language
of children (Bartsch & Wellman, 1995; Jenkins et al., 2003). The current study
addresses the relative importance of desire and belief state language in later ToM task
performance. Both toddlers and mothers tended to use fewer cognitive state terms at
the age of two than desire state terms, but even low levels of child cognitive state
language were related to maternal cognitive state language used in an appropriate
fashion. Previous literature has shown that children tend to develop ﬁrst a ‘naïve’
understanding of simple desires at the age of two, and a more complex belief under-
standing at the age of four (see Wellman, 1990). Desire understanding emerges ﬁrst in
children, as they are primarily concerned with their wants, and communicating desires
is a primary goal and extension of preverbal requests to obtain something. The verb
want quickly becomes attached to an object phrase, that is, the object of the desire.
Montgomery (2005) suggests that mothers providing desire state language to commu-
nicate these toddler wants is a signiﬁcant achievement; that is, mothers scaffold
language to label and articulate these wants and this interactive process leads to
enhanced social understanding three years later.

There was no evidence that cognitive state language in early joint play predicts later
ToM. Ruffman et al. (2002) proposed that children’s social understanding is rooted
initially in the desire state talk of their mothers, which then becomes scaffolded into
belief state talk later during the preschool period. This pattern may reverse itself at an
older age when belief understanding emerges, such as at the age of four. At this age, it
could be expected that belief understanding predicts later ToM, but desire language is no
longer predictive. This pattern was found by Hughes and Dunn (1998), who showed that
children’s use of cognitive state terms during peer interactions at the age of four
predicted a ToM aggregate on average 13 months later, even when age, language, and
original ToM performance were controlled. In a recent analysis of joint reading inter-
actions in children entering elementary school (i.e., grade primary, kindergarten), the
maternal appropriate cognitive state language concurrently predicted ToM, even when
maternal desire state language, as well as the child cognitive, desire and general
language were all controlled (Symons, Fossum & Peterson, 2005). Beyond the preschool
period, language about cognitive states by children may be related to ToM even when
discourse is deﬁned as formal, and orderly, and extended thought on a subject, such as
when children are asked to make up stories in response to pictures (see also Symons
et al., 2005).

There are a number of limitations of the current study. Firstly, the current data address
the potential role of general language at time 1 using MLU as an estimate of child
language use, but there is no measure of child language at the age of ﬁve as a concurrent
confound of ToM performance. This is problematic because general language measures

Discourse and Theory of Mind

689

often correlate with ToM performance, even though the current data point to a speciﬁc
feature of language experience that is predictive. Other approaches have been to
examine speciﬁc features of the semantics and syntax of language (Perner, Sprung,
Zauner & Haider, 2003), something not addressed in the current study, where words
were coded independent of their linguistic function. Secondly, the small numbers in the
current study invites type II error, so the failure of the demographic variables of age,
SES and, particularly, language to predict ToM should not be over-interpreted. Thirdly,
it would also be preferable that child and mother play measures at time 1 be taken from
different observational sessions. Right now, interrelations of the language of the mother
and child during play are difﬁcult to interpret as an individual difference of a session,
dyad, or person. In fact, the interdependence of maternal and child language measures
support a systemic view in which the ﬁrst child language precursor of a ToM may be
children participating in conversations about desire states. Finally, it is recognized that
the current ToM measures have been selected as common false belief tasks used in the
literature, but they are a small subset of the constantly growing list of tasks that address
different features of the broader construct of social understanding.

This study resonates with Vygotsky’s (1978) general developmental proposition that
inter-psychological activity ultimately becomes the intra-psychological activity of the
child. Just as Bruner (1986) proposed that the internal speech of children arises from
children internalizing the rules of language and dialogue, the current study proposes
that children’s social understanding has origins in their social discourse with their
parents. Nelson et al. (2003) have emphasized the experiential nature of language and
its role in the development of social understanding. In their model, language serves a
representational function, and mental state talk facilitates the representations of self
and others as mental beings (see also Chandler & Carpendale, 2003; Symons, 2004) as
well as shared communication about third party concepts within epistemic triangles
(Carpendale & Lewis, 2004). Hughes and Dunn (1998) have argued that one of the
most important milestones in toddlerhood is the acquisition of internal state language
and the ability to reason non-egocentrically about other people’s feelings and desires.
The current study has shown that desire state language may play a key developmental
role in this process in children that have just turned two.
