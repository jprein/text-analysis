 PELLEGRINI, DAVID S. Social Cognition and Competence in Middle Childhood. CHILD DEVELOP-
 MENT, 1985, 56, 253-264. 2 aspects of social cognition-interpersonal understanding and means-
 ends problem-solving ability-were evaluated in fourth- to seventh-grade children and related to
 sex, age, IQ, social class, and multiple dimensions of competence. Results indicated that both social-
 cognitive components were significantly correlated with IQ, while interpersonal understanding was
 also correlated with age and social class. Nevertheless, interpersonal understanding and means-ends
 problem-solving ability made significant contributions in accounting for variance in several compe-
 tence variables even after IQ and other important status variables were taken into account. Implica-
 tions for social cognition research are discussed.

 Interest in the nature and development

 of social cognition is a relatively recent phe-
 nomenon in psychology. Although the do-
 main is a broad and diverse one, a basic as-
 sumption underlies most of the work in this
 area-namely, that the way in which one rea-
 sons about other people and about social situ-
 ations is a major determinant of one's social
 behavior and adjustment (Shantz, 1983).
 However, empirical analyses of the links be-
 tween social cognition and various dimen-
 sions of competence are relatively rare. This
 scientific neglect is surprising, given long-
 standing recognition that the nature of this re-
 lationship has important implications not just
 for theory, but also for our efforts to remediate
 social maladjustment (Berndt, 1981; Shantz,
 1975). The present study was designed prin-
 cipally to investigate the degree to which two
 components of social cognition--interperso-
 nal understanding and means-ends prob-
 lem-solving ability-are relevant to multiple
 dimensions of competence in middle child-
 hood.

 Selman (1980) and his colleagues have
 described understanding of the interpersonal
 world in terms of a person's conceptions of
 other people in general (i.e., intrapsychic
 functioning), close friendships, and peer-
 group relations. Developmental change in in-
 terpersonal understanding is defined as an or-
 derly progression through a series of five
 hierarchically organized levels or "stages."
 According to Selman, developmental gains in
 social perspective-taking ability provide the
 foundation for advances in one's understand-
 ing of people, friendships, and groups.

 A series of cross-sectional (Selman, 1976;
 Selman, Jaquette, & Lavin, 1977) and longitu-
 dinal studies (Cooney & Selman, 1978;
 Gurucharri, Phelps, & Selman, 1984) have
 provided preliminary support for Selman's
 structural-developmental model. Moreover,
 other investigators employing alternative
 assessment strategies have given reason-
 ably congruent accounts of developmental
 changes in interpersonal understanding

 This paper is based in part on a doctoral dissertation submitted to the University of Minnesota.
 The research reported is part of the ongoing investigations of the Project Competence studies of
 stress-resistant children. Social cognition was one of a number of constructs investigated because of
 its theoretical and empirical links to competence. Results pertaining to stress resistance will be
 reported in subsequent integrations of project data. This study would not have been possible
 without the collaborative efforts of many people, including the parents, children, and school person-
 nel who participated and all the members of the research team. The author is especially grateful to
 Norman Garmezy, advisor and project director. Special thanks also to Ann Masten and Auke Telle-
 gen for their comments on the manuscript, to Robert Selman and Myrna Beth Shure for providing
 training in the administration and scoring of their measures, and finally to Eugene Urbain and Maria
 Gurucharri for serving as reliability scorers. This investigation was partially supported by the Na-
 tional Institute of Mental Health (MH-33222) and the William T. Grant Foundation through grants

 (Shantz, 1983; Tesch, 1983). However, while
 Selman's model describes the content of what
 children think about the social world and how
 that content is organized (i.e., as a series of
 stages), it fails to consider how that content
 and organization are utilized in social interac-
 tion.

 Jahoda (1953) was among the first to rec-
 ognize that an individual can choose to apply
 a variety of problem-solving skills and strate-
 gies in problematic social situations. The ap-
 plication of such skills and strategies, Jahoda
 reasoned, underlies effective interpersonal
 behavior.

 Recent research has identified a variety
 of discrete social problem-solving skills (see
 Pellegrini, in press, for a review). A particu-
 larly central role has been ascribed to means-
 ends thinking ability as a mediator of adjust-
 ment from middle childhood onward (Shure,
 1981). This problem-solving component has
 been defined as the ability to plan and coordi-
 nate a series of specific steps in order to reach
 a social goal and to recognize potential obsta-
 cles and alternative means to the goal within a
 realistic time framework (Spivack, Platt, &
 Shure, 1976). Undoubtedly, individuals draw
 on their storehouse of social knowledge in
 generating such plans to achieve their desired
 goals (Pellegrini, in press). Thus, the more
 mature one's interpersonal understanding,
 the more effective one's means-ends thinking
 is likely to be. However, the empirical rela-
 tionship between these two theoretically im-
 portant components of social-cognitive func-
 tioning has not previously been established.

 Individual differences in children's inter-
 personal understanding and means-ends
 problem-solving ability have also been rela-
 tively unexplored to date, although social-
 cognitive functioning in general has evi-
 denced little relation to sex and only a modest
 or moderate relation to IQ and social class
 (Shantz, 1983). Nevertheless, recent research
 has demonstrated that, as a group, socially
 maladjusted children suffer persistent lags in
 interpersonal understanding relative to com-
 parison groups of normal children (e.g.,
 Gurucharri et al., 1984; Selman, 1976; Sel-
 man, Lavin, & Brion-Meisels, 1982). Similar
 group differences have been observed with
 respect to means-ends problem-solving abil-
 ity (e.g., Higgins & Thies, 1981; Platt,
 Spivack, Altman, Altman, & Peizer, 1974;
 Shure & Spivack, 1972).

 Unfortunately, however, group compari-
 sons of this kind make it difficult to discern if
 interpersonal understanding and means-ends

 problem-solving ability are differentially
 linked to particular aspects of adjustment. Our
 therapeutic efforts would most likely be more
 efficient if we could target specific social-
 cognitive training programs for specific social-
 behavioral deficits. For example, Rubin and
 Krasnor (in press) have suggested that
 rudimentary problem-solving skills in pre-
 schoolers may be linked more closely to early
 peer rejection than to social isolation.

 Finally, it is as yet unclear to what extent
 individual differences in interpersonal under-
 standing and means-ends problem-solving
 ability account for differences in adjustment
 within the normal range. Correlations with
 competence indicators have been modest or
 moderate at best for both social-cognitive
 components in studies of normal children and
 adolescents to date (e.g., Ford, 1982; Kendall
 & Fischler, 1984; McKim, Weissberg, Cowen,
 Gesten, & Rapkin, 1982; Selman, 1976).

 The present study was undertaken, then,

 to shed light on the nature and significance of
 potentially important differences in interper-
 sonal understanding and means-ends prob-
 lem-solving ability in a normal sample of
 school children. It was hypothesized that in-
 dividual differences in these two social-
 cognitive components would be moderately
 related to age and IQ, modestly related to so-
 cial class, if at all, but unrelated to sex. It was
 also hypothesized that interpersonal under-
 standing and means-ends problem-solving
 ability would be at least moderately related to
 one another, but that they would each make
 independent contributions in accounting for
 variance in competence within this age
 group, above and beyond other traditionally
 powerful variables such as sex, IQ, and social
 class.

 Of particular interest was the possibility

 that interpersonal understanding and means-
 ends problem-solving ability might interact in
 accounting for competence, and the possibil-
 ity that either social-cognitive component
 might bear a different relationship to compe-
 tence for boys and girls and at different levels
 of IQ and social class. It was reasoned that
 combined deficits in interpersonal under-
 standing and means-ends problem-solving
 ability might limit competence more severely
 than one might expect on the basis of their
 individual relationships with competence.
 Similarly, superior functioning on these two
 dimensions of social cognition might poten-
 tiate competence in a nonadditive fashion. Fi-
 nally, it was reasoned that social-cognitive
 deficits might be particularly debilitating in
 conjunction with previously established ad-

 having a low IQ, or coming from a low-SES
 background.

 Method

 Subjects

 The original cohort from which the pres-
 ent subjects were drawn included all 302
 third- through sixth-grade students of a tradi-
 tional elementary school located in a predom-
 inantly "blue collar" community of central
 Minneapolis. This school was the setting for a
 series of studies concerned with competence
 and stress resistance in childhood (Garmezy
 & Tellegen, 1984). From this cohort a sample
 of 100 children (46 boys, 54 girls) were re-
 cruited as fourth through seventh graders for
 participation in the present study.1 Approx-
 imately 25% of the sample was from eth-
 nic minority backgrounds, including black,
 American Indian, Hispanic, and Asian. Socio-
 economic status (SES) was estimated by the
 Duncan Socioeconomic Index (Hauser &
 Featherman, 1977). Scores on this 100-point
 scale ranged from 11 to 92 (N = 95). The
 mean SES score (42) corresponded to such
 occupations as craftsworker, highly skilled
 laborer, and clerical worker.

 Measures

 The eight competence criterion variables
 in this study included three social compe-
 tence scores, four behavioral competence
 scores, and one academic competence score.
 The five main predictor variables included
 sex, SES, intellectual ability, maturity of in-
 terpersonal understanding, and means-ends
 problem-solving ability.

 score (Positive) and two seven-item negative
 reputation scores (Disruptive and Isolated).
 The number of votes received from children
 of both sexes on the relevant items was first
 tallied for each child. These "raw" summary
 scores were then standardized through z
 score transformation within classroom and sex
 to adjust for unequal sex and classrom size
 distribution. Previous research has docu-
 mented the high internal consistency of the
 three peer reputation scores, as well as their
 striking stability over 6-17-month intervals
 (Masten et al., 1984).

 Behavioral competence.-Ratings of be-
 havioral competence were obtained from
 each subject's primary teacher using the Dev-
 ereux Elementary School Behavior (DESB)
 Rating Scale (Spivack & Swift, 1967). The
 DESB has shown evidence of reliability and
 validity for differentiating maladjusted and
 poorly achieving children in the classroom
 (Kendall, Pellegrini, & Urbain, 1981). It con-
 sists of 47 items rated on either a five- or
 seven-point scale. Teachers were instructed
 to rate the behavior of children without re-
 gard to academic ability. Approximate scoring
 for four orthogonal factors yielded the follow-
 ing indices: Disruptive-Oppositional (18
 items), Poor Comprehension-Disattention
 (14 items), Cooperative-Initiating (8 items),
 and Performance Anxiety (4 items). These
 factor scores were found to be stable over a
 17-month interval and to have factorial valid-
 ity and high internal consistency (Finkelman
 & Ferrarese, 1981).

 Academic competence.-The Peabody

 Individual Achievement Test (PIAT; Dunn
 & Markwardt, 1970) was individually ad-
 ministered to obtain an index of academic
 of Lambert and Bower's (1961) "Class Play"
 competence. Standardized total scores for the
 measure provided peer assessments of social
 PIAT have a mean of 100 and a standard devi-
 competence. As "directors" of an imaginary
 ation (SD) of 15. The mean and SD of the
 class play, children cast their classmates into a
 present group were 96 and 12, respectively (N
 variety of "roles." The Revised Class Play
 = 93).
 (Masten, Morison, & Pellegrini, 1984) pre-
 sents 30 such roles, 15 positive (e.g., "a good
 leader") and 15 negative (e.g., "picks on other
 kids"). To eliminate potential sex-typed re-
 sponding in the assignment of roles, the Re-
 vised Class Play was administered twice in
 each classroom. First the whole class cast all
 classmates of one sex into the roles; then the
 class recast the play using only classmates of
 the remaining sex.

 Intellectual ability.-The Vocabulary
 and Block Design subtests of the Wechsler
 Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised
 (WISC-R) were administered to estimate in-
 tellectual ability. Taken together, these two
 subtests show a higher correlation with Full
 Scale IQ (r = .88) than any other pair of sub-
 tests (Silverstein, 1975). The mean Vocabu-
 lary and Block Design scores were 9.96 (SD
 = 3.20) and 10.47 (SD = 3.12), respectively
 (N = 95).

 Approximate scoring for three orthogonal
 factors yielded a 15-item positive reputation

 1 The distribution of subjects by grade was 10, 18, 11, and 7 for boys, and 24, 9, 12, and 9 for

 girls, in grades 4-7, respectively.

 256 Child Development

 Interpersonal understanding (IU).2-
 Selman's (1980) measure of interpersonal
 understanding was employed to assess the
 level of maturity characterizing subjects' con-
 ceptions of the social world. In this procedure
 children are presented with a series of three
 audiovisual filmstrips. Each filmstrip portrays
 an interpersonal dilemma in the context of an
 interesting vignette. The dilemmas are perti-
 nent to one of three "domains" of social rea-
 soning: the nature of people in general, close
 friendship, and peer-group relations. A struc-
 tured clinical interview is employed to probe
 children's formulations of the "issues" de-
 fining each domain. Some of the issues re-
 lated to friendship, for example, concern the
 nature of jealousy and the resolution of con-
 flict.

 Solving (MEPS) Test was employed to assess
 this theoretically important social problem-
 solving component. The MEPS Test is com-
 posed of six brief stories, each of which por-
 trays a different problematic social situation.
 In each story the sex of the protagonist varies
 to match the sex of the subject. Only the be-
 ginning of a story and its outcome are pre-
 sented. The child's task is to "fill in the mid-
 dle part" or "tell how the ending got to be
 that way." No limit is imposed on the subject
 with regard to the number of resolutions that
 may be offered. The stories provided by the
 subject are scored for three variables, which
 are then summed to provide a total means-
 ends problem-solving (MEPS) score: (a) rele-
 vant means: the number of discrete steps that
 the protagonist takes in a coherent plan to
 achieve the specified goal; (b) obstacles: the
 number of potential obstacles to goal attain-
 ment recognized by the protagonist; and (c)
 time references: the number of times the sub-
 ject recognizes the passage of time as a com-
 ponent of the problem-solving process.

 Two of the original MEPS stories con-
 cerning loneliness in a new neighborhood
 and maternal anger were adopted for use in
 the present study. Two others were modified
 to make them less "antisocial" in nature.
 These pertained to verbal aggression from a
 peer and needing a rod to join friends on a
 fishing trip. Finally, two additional stories
 were created to assess means-ends thinking
 in the context of goal frustration. These stories
 concerned losing a school election and being
 rejected from a social club.

 A modified scoring procedure was also
 employed. Means were defined in more
 molecular (and therefore less inferential)
 terms than those suggested by Shure and
 Spivack (1972). For example, credit was given
 for means that were listed as possible alterna-
 tive solutions to a dilemma even if the means
 were not fully incorporated into the logical
 progression of a narrative.
 Procedure

 Social cognition assessment.-All chil-
 dren were individually administered mea-
 sures of interpersonal understanding and
 means-ends problem-solving ability by the
 author, who was "blind" regarding their
 scores on competence, IQ, and SES variables.
 Since the IU measure required extensive prob-
 ing of a child's ideas about the social world, it

 Scoring of the IU measure was facilitated
 by reference to Selman and Jaquette's (1977)
 manual, which provides stage-by-stage de-
 scriptions of the developmental course of so-
 cial reasoning for comparison to subject inter-
 view responses. Some modifications were
 made, however, in the recommended scoring
 procedures. First, rather than review each in-
 terview protocol in its entirety before scor-
 ing individual responses, subjects' responses
 to each interview question were scored
 "blindly" or without prior knowledge of their
 responses to other questions. This was in-
 tended to reduce the possibility of rater bias.
 Second, rather than weigh stage scores differ-
 entially, based on the frequency of occur-
 rence and the articulateness of the response, a
 simple averaging procedure was employed to
 compute summary scores. This modification
 was made to capture naturally occurring vari-
 ability in the social reasoning of children, and
 to represent more accurately typical social-
 cognitive performance rather than maximum
 ability.

 In the present study, then, a subject's re-
 sponse to each interview question or item was
 assigned a stage score. The item scores for a
 given issue were then averaged to form a set
 of issue scores. These were in turn averaged
 to form a general domain score. Finally, the
 three domain scores were averaged to yield a
 measure of global interpersonal understand-
 ing (IU).

 was more likely to facilitate performance on
 the MEPS measure than the reverse. To mini-
 mize possible order effects, then, the MEPS
 measure was always administered prior to the
 three IU interviews, which were themselves
 presented in random order. Interviews were
 audiotaped and then transcribed for scoring
 purposes.

 both global IU and total MEPS were stan-
 dardized through z score transformation
 within grade prior to undertaking further cor-
 relational analyses. This procedure facilitated
 comparisons between the two social cognition
 variables, as well as comparisons with compe-
 tence variables, each of which was already
 age or grade "corrected." The results of these
 analyses are portrayed in Table 1.

 All social cognition protocols were

 scored by the author. To determine interrater
 reliability estimates, a random subset of 25
 protocols was also scored by one of two psy-
 chology graduate students who were previ-
 ously trained in the appropriate scoring pro-
 cedures (see Results).

 Other measures. -Procedures for all

 other measures reported here have been de-
 tailed elsewhere (Garmezy & Tellegen,
 1984). Various members of the Project Com-
 petence research team contributed to the ad-
 ministration of these measures. Academic
 achievement and IQ measures were adminis-
 tered contemporaneous with or subsequent to
 the social cognition measures (within 6
 months). Peer and teacher measures were ad-
 ministered in the previous school year (gener-
 ally 10-15 months earlier).

 Results

 Reliability

 All reliabilities for social cognition vari-
 ables were satisfactory. Interrater reliabilities
 ranged from .90 to .98 for the three IU domain
 scores and from .86 to .96 for the three MEPS
 component scores. Internal consistency re-
 liabilities (Cronbach's alpha) ranged from .67
 to .85 for IU domain scores and from .62 to .84
 for MEPS component scores. Reliabilities
 were highest for the two social cognition sum-
 mary scores. Interrater and internal consis-
 tency reliabilities were .90 and .98, respec-
 tively, for global IU, and .98 and .88,
 respectively, for total MEPS ability.

 Social-Cognitive Performance: Relationship
 to Age, Sex, SES, and IQ

 Raw scores for global IU in the present

 sample ranged from .52 to 2.68 (M = 1.79, SD
 = .36). Total MEPS raw scores ranged from 1
 to 72 (M = 30.18, SD = 9.94).4 Not surpris-
 ingly, global IU scores were positively related
 to age (r = .35, p < .001), although total
 MEPS scores were not (r = - .12, N.S.). In
 light of this developmental variability in in-
 terpersonal understanding, raw scores for

 As predicted, global IU and total MEPS
 scores were moderately and positively inter-
 related (r = .56, p < .001). Moreover, both
 global IU and total MEPS were moderately
 related to IQ (r = .57 and .45, respectively, p
 < .001), while neither social cognition score
 was significantly related to sex. However,
 only global IU was even modestly related to
 SES (r = .26, p < .001).
 Interrelationships among Competence,
 Social Cognition, and Other Subject
 Variables

 A coherent pattern of generally signifi-

 cant intercorrelations is also observable in
 Table 1 with regard to the indices of compe-
 tence both within and across domains. At
 best, however, these intercorrelations were
 modest to moderate in magnitude, suggesting
 a considerable degree of independence
 among the dimensions of competence that
 were assessed (see also Masten et al., 1984).
 With the exception of the absence of a
 relationship between global IU and disrup-
 tive peer reputation, both aspects of social-
 cognitive functioning evidenced consistently
 positive relationships with positive indicators
 of competence (peer-rated positive repu-
 tation, teacher-rated cooperativeness, and
 academic achievement) and consistently
 negative relationships with indicators of in-
 competence (peer-rated disruptive and iso-
 lated reputation, teacher-rated disruptiveness,
 poor comprehension, and performance anxi-
 ety). Similar correlational patterns were ob-
 served for both IQ and SES with regard to
 competence, while being a boy tended to be
 negatively associated with behavioral compe-
 tence as judged by teachers.

 Regression Analyses of Competence

 A series of hierarchical multiple regres-
 sion analyses were undertaken next in order
 to clarify the extent to which variability in
 competence could be accounted for by in-
 terpersonal understanding and means-ends
 problem-solving ability. Cohen and Cohen

 (1975) have described the strategic advan-
 tages of multiple regression as a general
 method of data analysis, especially for clarify-
 ing the complex relationships inherent in cor-
 relational data. The hierarchical model, in
 particular, allows one to specify the unique
 contribution that each independent variable
 makes in accounting for the variance in a de-
 pendent variable when included as a separate
 step in an analysis.

 Sex was the first independent variable
 entered into each regression equation, since it
 constitutes a "fixed" factor that could not be
 affected by the other subject variables. SES
 was entered second, ahead of IQ, in order to
 distinguish most clearly its relative "explana-
 tory power." Preliminary analyses indicated
 that the variance accounted for by SES is
 otherwise largely absorbed if IQ is given pre-
 cedence in the hierarchical order. The two
 social cognition scores were entered into each
 analysis next (i.e., as steps four and five). This
 allowed for an evaluation of the unique "ex-
 planatory power" of interpersonal under-
 standing and means-ends problem-solving
 ability with respect to each dimension of com-
 petence.

 Since mature interpersonal understand-

 ing was construed as a partial foundation for
 effective means-ends problem-solving, global
 IU scores were initially entered prior to total
 MEPS scores in each regression equation.
 However, in order to clarify the overlap be-
 tween these two social-cognitive components
 in accounting for competence, this portion of
 the regression equations was repeated with
 total MEPS scores entered before global IU
 scores.

 < .001), suggesting that nonrandom relation-
 ships existed between the two sets of vari-
 ables and that further analysis was warranted.

 Results of the subsequent regression
 analyses are summarized in Table 2. Each
 column reflects the regression of a compe-
 tence variable on the 12 independent vari-
 ables. For each step the increment in R2 is
 indicated, along with the significance of the
 increment. As can be seen here, some notable
 differences emerged both within and among
 the three competence domains with regard to
 the explanatory power of social-cognitive
 functioning.

 Despite substantial bivariate correlations
 with the PIAT, neither interpersonal under-
 standing nor means-ends problem-solving
 ability provided a statistically significant in-
 crement in R2 for academic competence.
 Taken together, the two social cognition vari-
 ables increased the variance accounted for in
 this dimension of competence by only 2%.
 This appeared to be due primarily to the sub-
 stantial overlap between social cognition and
 IQ, the latter accounting for 49% of the vari-
 ance in academic competence on its own.

 Interpersonal understanding and means-
 ends problem-solving ability also failed to
 provide significant increments in R2 with re-
 gard to peer-rated disruptive reputation and
 teacher-rated cooperativeness. When the en-
 tire set of independent variables was consid-
 ered, disruptive reputation and cooperative-
 ness were the least well accounted for of all
 the competence indicators. Nevertheless,
 global IU and total MEPS provided modest
 but significant increments in R2 for peer-rated
 isolated reputation (8%), as well as for
 teacher-rated disruptiveness (7%), poor com-
 prehension (8%), and performance anxiety
 (6%). The two social-cognitive components
 were most predictive of positive peer reputa-
 tion, accounting on their own for 19% of the
 variance in this social competence indicator.

 For five of the eight competence vari-
 ables, means-ends problem-solving ability
 provided somewhat larger increments in R2
 when entered as the first social-cognitive
 component in each regression equation than
 did interpersonal understanding. Moreover,
 means-ends problem-solving ability provided
 statistically significant increments in R2 for
 three competence indicators even when en-
 tered as the second social-cognitive compo-
 nent, whereas interpersonal understanding
 provided a significant increment for only one
 competence indicator when entered second.

 Seven speculative interaction effects

 were also considered: global IU by (1) sex, (2)
 SES, and (3) IQ; total MEPS by (4) sex, (5)
 SES, and (6) IQ; and (7) global IU by total
 MEPS. These hypothesized interactions were
 evaluated by entering their corresponding
 multiplicative terms at the end of the regres-
 sion equations. Each term was entered in
 stepwise fashion, since no expectations had
 been formulated concerning causal priorities
 among them. In order to control for "ex-
 perimentwise" error, individual interaction
 effects were examined only if the set of seven
 interactions provided a statistically significant
 increment in R2 for a given dimension of com-
 petence (see Cohen & Cohen, 1975).

 As a first test of the association between

 the eight dependent and 12 independent mea-
 sures, the first canonical correlation was cal-
 culated. The resulting correlation was .88 (p

 well as between interpersonal understanding
 and sex. These two interaction effects pro-
 vided increments of 7% and 4%, respectively,

 two social-cognitive components were onlt
 moderately independent of each other, how-
 ever. In general, means-ends problem-solving
 ability provided somewhat larger increments
 in R than did interpersonal understanding
 with respect to competence. This pattern of
 findings is consistent with the notion that ma-
 ture interpersonal understanding serves as
 the foundation for and is encompassed by ef-
 fective means-ends thinking. It is almost cer-
 tainly not enough that children understand
 the social world. They must also weave their
 knowledge into an adaptive fabric of strate-
 gies for solving the commonplace dilemmas
 of everyday social life.

 Discussion

 The data from the present study consis-
 tently converge on two major conclusions.
 First, although substantially correlated with
 intellectual ability, interpersonal understand-
 ing and means-ends problem-solving ability
 are more than just alternative conceptualiza-
 tions of IQ. Second, maturity in reasoning
 about the social world and resourcefulness in
 planning solutions to hypothetical social di-
 lemmas are both salient characteristics of chil-
 dren who are competent in the school en-
 vironment.

 The amount of variance accounted for by
 interpersonal understanding and means-ends
 problem-solving ability also varied consider-
 ably in the present sample as a function of the
 particular dimension of competence being
 considered. This highly differentiated net-
 work of relationships is noteworthy since
 reliance on the school as a common observa-
 tional context undoubtedly exaggerated inter-
 relationships among the competence mea-
 sures themselves. Clearly, however,
 replication is necessary before confidence can
 be attached to the specific pattern of relation-
 ships observed.

 The positive interrelationships observed
 among interpersonal understanding, means-
 ends problem-solving ability, and IQ were in
 keeping with expectations and prior findings
 (e.g., Kendall & Fischler, 1984; Selman,
 1976). Undoubtedly, a major portion of the
 overlap observed among these constructs
 reflects shared method variance. Available
 measures of social cognition such as those
 employed in the present study have been
 criticized for relying on verbal-expressive
 skills and on hypothetical rather than real-life
 stimuli (e.g., Keating & Clark, 1980; Krasnor
 & Rubin, 1981). Measurement inadequacies
 of this kind may be largely responsible for our
 general inability to identify a coherent and
 discriminable domain of "social intelligence"
 (e.g., see Keating, 1978).

 Nevertheless, some evidence of ecolog-
 ical validity is available for "hypothetical-
 reflective" measures of both interpersonal
 understanding (e.g., Selman, Schorin, Stone,
 & Phelps, 1983) and means-ends problem-
 solving ability (e.g., Kendall & Fischler,
 1984). Moreover, in the present sample inter-
 personal understanding and means-ends
 problem-solving ability accounted for signifi-
 cant proportions of variance in a number of
 dimensions of competence even after IQ, as

 Nevertheless, the relative strength of the
 contribution made by interpersonal under-
 standing and means-ends problem-solving
 ability in accounting for positive peer reputa-
 tion was particularly striking. Items marking
 this dimension of competence pertained
 largely to prosocial behaviors such as playing
 fairly, acting trustworthily, and waiting one's
 turn (see Masten et al., 1984). Prior efforts to
 link prosocial behavior to perspective-taking
 ability, empathy, and other social-cognitive
 variables have yielded mixed results (Shantz,
 1983). However, the majority of such studies
 have relied on observations of prosocial be-
 havior. Such links may be more difficult to
 establish in this fashion than with indices of
 peer reputation since prosocial behaviors ap-
 pear to be relatively difficult to observe.

 Observational studies of classroom be-

 havior have suggested that positive peer in-
 teraction focused on academic matters can
 facilitate learning (e.g., Cobb, 1972; Soli &
 Devine, 1976). One might reasonably expect,
 then, that social-cognitive maturity would en-
 hance academic competence indirectly, by
 contributing to a child's ability to manage and

 direct social interaction in the classroom. It
 was somewhat surprising, then, that neither
 interpersonal understanding nor means-ends
 problem-solving ability made an independent
 contribution in accounting for variance in aca-
 demic competence once SES and IQ had
 been taken into account.

 Ford & Tisak, 1983). The observed relation-
 ships with interpersonal understanding and
 means-ends problem-solving ability might
 not generalize to competence evaluated in
 other contexts (e.g., the playground or neigh-
 borhood) and from other perspectives (e.g.,
 parents, siblings, or close friends).

 Further investigation is clearly necessary
 in order to understand the processes that
 underlie social-cognitive functioning. Devel-
 opmental changes in means-ends problem-
 solving, in particular, are in need of explica-
 tion. Contrary to expectations, MEPS scores
 in the present sample tended to decline
 somewhat with age. However, it was the in-
 vestigator's impression that the "storytelling"
 format of the MEPS measure generally had
 less appeal for older children in the sample. If
 so, the observed trend may have been an ar-
 tifact of the assessment procedure rather than
 a function of the absence of developmental
 growth in means-ends thinking within this
 age range.

 The set of hypothesized interaction ef-

 fects considered in the present study also
 failed to account for significant increments of
 variance in competence, except for isolated
 peer reputation. The significant interaction
 observed between intellectual ability and in-
 terpersonal understanding, however, may
 warrant further investigation because of its
 implications for therapeutic intervention.

 Immature understanding of the social
 world in conjunction with above-average IQ
 was associated in the present sample with
 particularly high peer isolation scores. This
 ability pattern suggests a youngster who lacks
 social "know-how" despite adequate intelli-
 gence. Cognitive "decalage" of this kind may
 result in self-doubt and tentativeness in initi-
 ating social contact. At the same time, how-
 ever, such innate intellectual ability might
 facilitate training geared specifically toward
 the enhancement of social understanding
 (e.g., see Jurkovic & Selman, 1980).

 Correlational studies of the kind reported
 here clearly cannot provide definitive evi-
 dence of the actual processes that link inter-
 personal understanding and means-ends
 problem-solving ability to dimensions of com-
 petence or to each other. The present study is
 particularly handicapped in this regard, since
 measures of social and behavioral compe-
 tence (though relatively stable) were adminis-
 tered prior to measures of social-cognitive
 functioning. The available data base is
 equally consistent with the notion that posi-
 tive interaction with teachers and peers facili-
 tates the development of social cognition, as it
 is with the notion that mature social-cognitive
 functioning underlies the development of so-
 cial and behavioral competence. Indeed, the
 relationship between social cognition and
 competence most likely is one of bilateral
 reciprocity rather than unilateral causality
 (Shantz, 1983).

 The present study provides ample jus-
 tification for pursuing further the links among
 interpersonal understanding, means-ends
 problem-solving ability, and competence.
 However, future investigators should be sure
 to consider indices of competence beyond
 those considered here. Competence itself ap-
 pears to be a multifaceted construct (see also

 Alternatively, the age results may reflect
 the beginnings of an important transformation
 in the problem-solving process itself. Langer
 (1978) has argued that, for the most part, adult
 social behavior is "unthinking" in nature and
 proceeds according to overlearned "social
 scripts." As children gain increasing familiar-
 ity with the normative course of social trans-
 actions, they may "edit out" reference to rela-
 tively uncommon or less successful pathways
 to a particular social goal, resulting in declin-
 ing or at best stable scores on "free response"
 measures like the MEPS Test.

 Priority should also be given in the future
 to investigating the circumstances in which
 children are actually required to apply their
 social-cognitive abilities to ongoing social in-
 teraction. The application process has been
 virtually ignored to date, despite its obvious
 relevance to the development of effective pro-
 grams for the enhancement of competence.
 The recent naturalistic studies of Selman and
 his colleagues (Jaquette, 1980; Selman et al.,
 1983) provide a useful model for investigating
 the application of interpersonal understand-
 ing to real-life social interaction. Krasnor and
 Rubin's (1981) observational approach fulfills
 a similar exemplary role with regard to vari-
 ous social problem-solving skills.

 Finally, additional research is needed in

 order to clarify the origins of individual differ-
 ences in both interpersonal understanding
 and means-ends problem-solving ability. For
 example, social problem-solving abilities in
 general, and means-ends thinking in particu-
