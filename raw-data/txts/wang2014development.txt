To  explore  the  developmental  trajectory  of  emotions  (happiness,  sadness,  anger,  and  fear) 
and  false  belief  understanding  (an  unexpected-location  and  an  unexpected-contents  task), 
we  measured  the  performance  of  3-  and  4-year-olds  4  times  at  approximately  half-yearly 
intervals. The  results  indicated  that  the  children’s  ability  to  understand  emotions  and  false 
beliefs increased significantly at each time point in the first year and a half, but no significant 
increases were found in the last 6 months. The developmental trajectories of the understanding 
of  emotions  and  false  beliefs  were  similar  during  the  2  years,  however,  the  developing 
track  of  the  emotions  of  happiness,  sadness,  fear,  and  anger  were  different.  Understanding 
of  happiness  developed  earlier  and  faster  than  understanding  of  sadness,  fear,  and  anger. 
In  regard  to  understanding  false  beliefs,  the  children  performed  better  in  the  unexpected- 
contents task than in the unexpected-location task. We found that a developmental relationship 
existed between emotion and false belief understanding.

Keywords: false belief understanding, emotion understanding, preschoolers.

EMOTION AND FALSE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING

Developing an understanding of false beliefs and emotions marks a paramount 
step  in  young  children’s  acquisition  of  understanding  about  the  social  and 
internal  world.  Emotions  are  the  consequences  of  situational  determinants 
and  others’  intentional  states,  desires,  or  beliefs  (Denham,  1986;  Wellman  & 
Banerjee, 1991). Understanding of false beliefs, which has often been identified 
as the developmental milestone of theory of mind, means grasping a belief that 
doesn’t  match  with  current  reality  (Wellman,  Cross,  &  Watson,  2001).  Lane, 
Wellman,  Olson,  LaBounty,  and  Kerr  (2010)  suggested  that  false  belief  and 
emotion understanding are different abilities. However, Hughes and Dunn (1998) 
reported  that  the  performance  of  individuals  in  tasks  to  assess  their  emotion 
understanding  correlated  with  their  performance  in  false  belief  tasks.  Despite 
the theoretical debate, rapid changes have been documented in both false belief 
and emotion understanding in children aged from 3 and 6 years, that is, the older 
children have been found consistently to make more accurate responses than the 
younger children in understanding emotions and when beliefs are false (Sui & 
Su, 2003; Widen & Russell, 2008). 

Some  researchers  have  found  that  3-year-olds  can  identify  basic  facial 
expressions  accurately  (Székely  et  al.,  2011)  and  demonstrate  that  they 
understand  that  certain  emotions  should  be  elicited  by  certain  situational  cues 
(Denham,  1986).  The  cross-sectional  findings  of  Gao  and  Maurer  (2009) 
indicated that happiness was the easiest emotion to understand and that fear was 
the most difficult. 

Two types of tasks frequently used to measure false belief understanding are 
the unexpected-contents task (Gopnik & Astington, 1988) and the unexpected-
location  task  (Wimmer  &  Perner,  1983).  In  the  unexpected-contents  task, 
children are shown a container with outside markings that indicate what should 
be  inside.  However,  the  container  has  something  unexpected  inside  when  it  is 
opened. In the unexpected-location task, children are shown that something is put 
in one location by a person and then moved to another location when the person 
has gone. In these two tasks, the children should understand that the beliefs of 
others, or of themselves, do not match with the current reality. Wellman, Cross, 
and  Watson  (2001)  performed  a  meta-analysis  and  found  that  there  were  no 
significant differences in how well children understood the unexpected-location 
task and the unexpected-contents task, but the findings of Wang, Lin, and Zhang 
(2003) suggested that the children found the unexpected-contents task easier than 
the unexpected-location task.

In  most  previous  studies,  researchers  have  used  a  cross-sectional  design  to 
investigate the developmental trajectory of false belief understanding (using the 
unexpected-location and unexpected-contents tasks) and emotion understanding 
(happiness, sadness, anger, and fear), and the relationship between understanding 
of emotions and false beliefs (Hughes & Dunn, 1998; Tager-Flusberg & Sullivan, 

EMOTION AND FALSE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING

2000; Wang & Su, 2009; Widen & Russell, 2008). In only a few studies have 
researchers provided longitudinal evidence (Dunn, 1995; McAlister & Peterson, 
2007). Our first purpose was to explore the developmental trajectory of emotion 
and  false  belief  understanding  through  measuring  the  performance  of  the 
participants  four  times  at  approximately  half-yearly  intervals  over  a  two-year 
period. Our second purpose was to examine the relative difficulty and consistency 
among the understanding of the four emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, and 
anger; between unexpected location and unexpected contents, representing two 
kinds of false belief tasks; and between emotion and false belief understanding 
at  the  four  time  points.  Our  third  purpose  was  to  explore  the  developmental 
relationship between emotion and false belief understanding.

Method

Participants

Participants were 121 preschool children including 67 3-year-olds (Mage = 41.52 
months;  SD  =  3.68  months;  age  range  =  36-47  months;  34  boys  and  33  girls) 
and 54 4-year-olds (Mage = 51.70 months; SD = 2.83 months; age range: 48-59 
months; 25 boys and 29 girls). We recruited the children from the Beijing Normal 
University Kindergarten in Beijing, China. All participants were children from 
one-child  families  and  came  from  a  middle-class  socioeconomic  background. 
The details of the participants at the four test times are set out in Table 1.

Procedure

All  the  children  first  participated  in  our  study  in  October,  2008.  We  tested 
each  child  individually  in  a  quiet  room.  We  measured  the  performance  of 
3-  and  4-year-olds  on  false  belief  and  emotion  understanding  four  times  at 
approximately half-yearly intervals. We used pictures, except in the unexpected-
contents  tasks,  to  show  the  children  two  false  belief  tasks  and  eight  emotion 
understanding  tasks.  The  order  of  all  the  tasks  was  counterbalanced  by  Latin 
square to avoid the effect of order. 

Measures and Scoring

False belief understanding. Unexpected-location task. We adapted this task 
from Baron-Cohen, Leslie, and Frith (1985). In our version a boy called Ming 
is playing with a ball. His mother asks him to come and have lunch. Ming hides 
the ball behind a tree and departs. While he is gone, his mother moves the ball to 
a box. The experimenter asked the children four questions about Ming’s return 
(Cassidy, Fineberg, Brown, & Perkins, 2005): “Does Ming know where the ball 
is now?,” “If you were Ming, would you know where the ball is now?,” “Where 
will Ming look for the ball?,” and “If you were Ming, where would you look for

the ball?” Each child was also asked two memory questions: “Where did Ming 
put the ball originally?” and “Where is the ball now?”  All the children we tested 
answered all the memory questions correctly. 

Unexpected-contents task. We adapted this task from Perner, Frith, Leslie, 
and  Leekam  (1989).  The  experimenter  showed  the  children  a  familiar  candy 
wrapper that actually contained a piece of chalk and asked what they thought was 
inside. After the experimenter showed them that the wrapper contained a piece of 
chalk, they were asked four test questions (Cassidy et al., 2005): “When you first 
saw the candy, did you know what was really inside?,” “When someone else first 
saw the candy wrapper, would s/he know what was really inside?,” “When you 
first saw the candy, what did you think was really inside?,” and “When someone 
else first saw the candy wrapper, what would s/he think was really inside?” One 
memory question followed: “What is really in the candy wrapper now?” All of 
the children answered the memory question in our test correctly. 

 Each child completed an unexpected-contents task and an unexpected-location 
task. The order of control and test questions in each story was counterbalanced 
according to the Latin square format and then we randomly assigned each child 
to a different order. A correct response to each test question was scored with 1 
and an incorrect response with 0. The total false belief scores ranged from 0 to 8. 
Emotion understanding. We adapted eight stories from Denham (1986), all 
of which required an inference about one’s own and others’ feelings involving 
happiness (three stories), sadness (three stories), fear (one story), and anger (one 
story).  The  story  characters’  gender  was  matched  to  the  participants’  gender. 
For example, the father of Xiao Qiang (Xiao Hong) bought a big cake for him/
her. After  each  story,  the  experimenter  asked  the  child  two  test  questions  and 
one memory question. Test questions were “How does Xiao Qiang (Xiao Hong) 
feel?” and “If you were Xiao Qiang (Xiao Hong), how would you feel?” One 
memory question followed: “What did the father of Xiao Qiang (Xiao Hong) buy 
for him/her?” A correct response to each test question was scored with 1 and an 
incorrect response with 0. The score range of happiness and sadness was from 0 
to 6, and that of anger and fear from 0 to 2. The total score range was from 0 to 
16. All of the children answered the memory questions correctly. 

Results

Emotion Understanding
To compare scores for the four kinds of emotions, the scores of anger and fear 
were transformed to a comparable scale that was used for happiness and sadness 
by multiplying the scores of anger and fear by 3  (Gopnik & Astington, 1988). 

We performed a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with type 
of  emotion  (happiness/sadness/anger/fear)  and  time  point  as  within-subject

EMOTION AND FALSE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING

independent  variables.  The  main  effects  for  emotions,  F(3,  255)  =  39.30, 
p < .01, 2 = 0.32, and time points, F(3, 255) = 47.19, p < .01, 2 = 0.36, and 
the  interaction  between  them,  F(9,  765)  =  2.82,  p  <  .01,  2  =  0.03,  were  all 
significant. Post hoc tests (Bonferroni) for type of emotion showed that happiness 
scored significantly higher than sadness, fear, and anger, p < .01. Sadness scored 
higher  than  fear,  p  <  .01.  Post  hoc  tests  (Bonferroni)  for  time  point  indicated 
that the scores at times 2, 3, and 4 were higher than those at time 1, p < .05, the 
scores at times 3 and 4 were higher than those at time 2, p < .05, and there was 
no significant difference between times 3 and 4, p > .05.

We calculated simple effects. Four ANOVA with time point as a within-subject 
independent  variable  revealed  that  significant  differences  existed  among  the 
four time points for happiness, F(3, 255) = 20.45, p < .01, 2 = 0.19, sadness, 
F(3,  255)  =  27.30,  p  <  .01,  2  =  0.24,  fear,  F(3,  255)  =  16.63,  p  <  .01,  2  = 
0.16, and anger, F(3, 255) = 9.82, p < .01, 2 = 0.10. Post hoc tests (Bonferroni) 
revealed that for happiness and anger, the scores at times 2, 3, and 4 were higher 
than those at time 1, p < .01. For sadness, the scores at times 3 and 4 were higher 
than those at times 1 and 2, p < .01. For fear, the scores at times 3 and 4 were 
higher than those at time 1, and the score at time 4 was higher than that at time 
2, p < .01. No other significant differences were found, p > .05.

When  we  calculated  four  ANOVA  with  each  of  the  types  of  emotion  as  a 
within-subject independent variable, there were significant differences among the 
four emotions at time 1, F(3, 360) = 21.34, p < .01, 2 = 0.15; time 2, F(3, 360) 
= 22.64, p < .01, 2 = 0.16; time 3, F(3, 300) = 12.90, p < .01, 2 = 0.11; and 
time 4, F(3, 279) = 13.17, p < .01, 2 = 0.12. Post hoc tests (Bonferroni) revealed 
that at times 1, 2, 3, and 4, happiness scored higher than sadness, anger, and fear, 
p < .05. At time 2, fear and anger scored higher than sadness, p < .05. At time 4, 
fear scored higher than sadness, p < .05. No other significant differences were 
found, p > .05.

False Belief Understanding

We  conducted  a  repeated  measure  ANOVA  with  type  of  false  belief  task 
(unexpected  location/unexpected  contents)  and  time  point  as  within-subject 
independent variables. It yielded significant main effects for type of false belief 
task,  F(1,  85)  =  36.43,  p  <  .01, 2  =  0.30,  and  time  point,  F(3,  255)  =  64.70, 
p < .01, 2 = 0.43, but no significant interaction between them, F(3, 255) = 2.39, 
p  >  .05, 2  =  0.01.  Post  hoc  tests  (Bonferroni)  for  time  point  showed  that  the 
scores at time 4 were higher than at times 1, 2, and 3, those at time 3 were higher 
than times 1 and 2, and those at time 2 were higher than time 1, p < .01.

Relationship Between Emotion and False Belief Understanding

First,  in  a  rough  comparison  of  children’s  performance  on  false  belief  and 

EMOTION AND FALSE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING

651

emotion  understanding,  we  used  the  quartile  because  of  various  score  ranges. 
The mean scores for false belief understanding at time 1 were concentrated in 
the area below 25% and at time 2 were between 25% and 50%; the mean scores 
for emotion understanding at time 1 were in the range of 25% to 50% and at time 
2  were  above  75%. These  data  implied  that  emotion  understanding  developed 
earlier than false belief understanding.

Second, to compare scores on the emotion and false belief tasks, the scores for 
false belief understanding (score range: 0-8) were transformed to a comparable 
scale to that used for emotion understanding (score range: 0-16) by multiplying 
the scores of false belief by 2 (Gopnik & Astington, 1988). A repeated measure 
ANOVA with type of task (emotion/false belief) and time point as within-subject 
independent  variables  was  done.  The  main  effects  for  task,  F(1,  85)  =  47.05, 
p < .01, 2 = 0.36, and time point, F(3, 255) = 102.44, p < .01, 2 = 0.55, and 
the  interaction  between  them,  F(3,  255)  =  8.89,  p  <  .01,  2  =  0.10,  were  all 
significant. Post hoc tests (Bonferroni) for time point indicated that the scores at 
times 2, 3, and 4 were all higher than those at time 1, the scores at times 3 and 
4 were both higher than those at time 2, p < .01, and no significant differences 
existed between times 3 and 4, p > .05. Simple effects were calculated. Results of 
four t tests revealed that the scores for emotion understanding were higher than 
those for false belief understanding at time 1, t(120) = 8.05, p < .01, time 2, t(120) 
= 7.25, p < .01, and time 3, t(100) = 2.92, p < .01, but there was no significant 
difference at time 4, t(93) = 0.06, p > .05.

Third,  emotion  understanding  correlated  significantly  with  false  belief 
understanding at time 1, r = 0.43, p < .01, time 2, r = 0.42, p < .01, and time 3, 
r = 0.33, p < .01, but there was no significant correlation between them at time 4, 
r = 0.14, p >.05. With age control, emotion understanding correlated with false 
belief understanding at time 1, Part. R = 0.31, p < .01, time 2, Part. R = 0.33, 
p  <  .01,  and  time  3,  Part.  R  =  0.33,  p  <  .01,  but  there  was  no  significant 
correlation between them at time 4, r = 0.14, p > .05.

Discussion

Throughout  a  two-year  period  of  tracking  children’s  emotion  and  false 
belief  understanding,  their  abilities  improved  significantly  at  each  time  point 
in  the  first  year  and  a  half,  but  no  significant  improvements  were  found  in 
the  last  six  months. The  trajectories  of  the  children’s  emotion  and  false  belief 
understanding were similar in our longitudinal study. However, the results of the 
quartiles and repeated measure ANOVA consistently indicated that their emotion 
understanding developed earlier than their false belief understanding, especially 
at  time  points  1,  2,  and  3.  Tager-Flusberg  and  Sullivan  (2000)  suggested  that 
theory  of  mind  could  be  classified  into  two  components:  a  social-perceptual 

652

EMOTION AND FALSE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING

component and a social-cognitive component. The social-perceptual component 
refers to understanding people’s emotions, and the social-cognitive component 
refers  to  understanding  their  intentions,  desires,  and  thoughts.  Tager-Flusberg 
and Sullivan found that the social-perceptual component developed earlier than 
the  social-cognitive  component.  Our  findings  demonstrated  the  application  of 
this  cognitive  model  of  theory  of  mind  in  a  longitudinal  setting.  In  addition, 
Wellman and Liu (2004) developed a scale based on theory of mind consisting 
of tasks that could help capture the developmental sequence across a range of 
conceptions understanding. Their findings indicated that the performance of the 
children whom they tested were similar for false belief tasks (for the unexpected-
location  task  57%  gave  correct  answers  and  for  the  unexpected-contents  59% 
gave correct answers) and for belief emotion tasks (52% correct response). Belief 
emotion refers to children’s judgment of a person’s feelings according to a given 
mistaken  belief.  The  emotion  understanding  tasks  in  our  study  were  based  on 
understanding  emotions  triggered  by  situations  that  were  different  from  belief 
emotion  understanding.  All  of  these  findings  suggest  that  there  are  different 
developmental sequences across different emotion understanding tasks.

When  we  controlled  for  age  in  our  study,  the  children’s  performances  on 
emotion  and  false  belief  understanding  correlated  significantly  at  times  1,  2, 
and 3. Developmental scientists have found that children develop the ability to 
understand false beliefs and emotions at the age of 4 or 5 years (Borke, 1973; 
Brown & Dunn, 1996; Wellman et al., 2001). Our results supported the existence 
of a developmental relationship between emotion understanding and false belief 
understanding.

Our findings indicated that the children’s understanding of happiness developed 
earlier and faster than their understanding of sadness, fear, and anger, though the 
trajectory of each of the four types of emotions was different. Findings in many 
cross-sectional studies have also demonstrated that children understand happiness 
sooner than negative emotions (Gao & Maurer, 2009; Rieffe, Meerum Terwogt, 
& Cowan, 2005). In a study about children’s ability to recognize emotion from 
facial  expressions,  Székely  et  al.  (2011)  found  that  the  children  recognized 
sadness more easily than they recognized fear. In our study, the scores for the 
children correctly attributing the emotion of sadness were lower than those for 
attributing the emotion of fear. Perhaps the content of the emotional situations 
we  presented  to  them  were  critical  to  the  children’s  performances.  Having  an 
injection  is  a  very  familiar  situation  for  preschoolers  as  there  is  a  government 
program for all children in China  to be vaccinated that begins from birth and 
continues until primary school. 

Wellman et al. (2001) suggested that unexpected-location tasks did not differ 
from  unexpected-content  tasks  in  that  the  children’s  rate  of  development  of 

EMOTION AND FALSE BELIEF UNDERSTANDING

653

understanding of the false belief involved in these tasks did not differ. However, 
our results indicated that at all four time points the children performed better on 
the unexpected-contents task than on the unexpected-location task. We presented 
the  unexpected-location  task  by  storytelling,  whereas  the  unexpected-contents 
task was presented through a physical demonstration. We surmised that perhaps 
the  physical  demonstration  was  easier  for  the  children  to  understand  than  the 
story. In addition, the children were bystanders in the unexpected-location task, 
whereas they were participants in the unexpected-content task. We believe that 
the children’s active involvement stimulated greater interest and may have helped 
them to more easily understand the situation than when they were bystanders.

The  main  limitation  in  the  present  study  is  that  the  experimental  materials 
were the same at all four times. Even though the experimenter did not give any 
feedback, the practice effect might still have existed because the children became 
very familiar with the measurements. Perhaps different measurements should be 
used at different times in future studies.

In  conclusion,  the  developmental  trajectories  of  the  children’s  emotion  and 
false belief understanding were similar over the two-year period during which we 
conducted our study. However, the developing track of the emotions of happiness, 
sadness,  fear,  and  anger  were  different.  Of  the  emotions,  children  showed  the 
greatest  understanding  of  happiness  and  they  showed  better  understanding 
of  the  unexpected-contents  task  than  the  unexpected-location  task.  We  found 
that  there  was  a  developmental  relationship  between  emotion  and  false  belief 
understanding. Our findings suggested that for the 3- and 4-year-olds who took 
part in our study, there was a significant increase in their ability to understand 
both emotions and false beliefs over the first 18 months, but no improvements 
thereafter.
