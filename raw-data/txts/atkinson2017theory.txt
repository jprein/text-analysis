Abstract 
 
The relation between children’s theory of mind (ToM) and emerging reading comprehension was 

investigated in a longitudinal study over 2.5 years. 80 children were tested for ToM, decoding, 

language skills and executive function (EF) at Time 1 (mean age = 3:10 years). At Time 2 (mean age 

= 6:03 years) children's word reading efficiency, language skills and reading comprehension were 

measured. Mediation analysis showed that ToM at Time 1, when children were around four years old, 

indirectly predicted Time 2 reading comprehension, when children were six years old, via language 

ability, after controlling for age, non-verbal ability, decoding, EF and earlier language ability. 

Importantly, ToM at four years old also directly predicted reading comprehension two and a half years 

later at six years. This is the first longitudinal study to show a direct contribution of theory of mind to 

reading comprehension in typical development. Findings are discussed in terms of the Simple View of 

Reading (SVR); ToM not only supports reading comprehension indirectly by facilitating language, but 

also directly contributes to it over and above the SVR. The potential role of metacognition is 

considered when accounting for the direct contribution of early ToM to later reading comprehension.

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

 

 

Theory of mind in emerging reading comprehension: a longitudinal study of early 

indirect and direct effects 

 
 
The Simple View of Reading (SVR; Gough & Tunmer, 1986; Hoover & Gough, 1990) proposes that 

reading comprehension is the product of two key dimensions: word reading (decoding) skills and 

linguistic comprehension. Though empirical evidence has shown that decoding ability and linguistic 

comprehension skills account for a large percentage of variance in reading comprehension (e.g., 

Adlof, Catts, & Little, 2006; Johnston & Kirby, 2006; Kendeou, van den Broek, White & Lynch, 

2009; Vellutino, Tunmer, Jaccard, & Chen, 2007), researchers have argued that the SVR may be too 

simple (e.g., Conners, 2009; Johnston & Kirby, 2006; Pressley et al., 2009) and that an additional 

component needs to be added to the model to account for variance unexplained by decoding and 

linguistic comprehension (Kirby & Savage, 2008). Potential candidates for this have included speed of 

processing, naming speed and executive function (EF) (e.g., Adlof et al., 2006; Johnson, Jenkins, & 

Jewell, 2005; Johnston & Kirby, 2006; Joshi & Aaron, 2000) as well as higher-order comprehension 

skills, such as inference making and comprehension monitoring (e.g., Cain, Oakhill, & Bryant, 2004; 

Kim, 2015; Oakhill & Cain, 2012). However, whilst these studies have shown that these factors 

contribute to reading comprehension performance it remains unclear whether their contribution is over 

and above the two dimensions of the SVR. The aim of the present study was to consider the role of 

theory of mind as a potential further factor facilitating emerging reading comprehension. 

 

 
Children’s developing attentional control has also been considered as a potential third component of 

the SVR. Conners (2009) reported that attentional control (the ability to inhibit irrelevant responses 

and initiate alternative responses) accounts for variance in reading comprehension even after 

controlling for decoding, language comprehension, processing speed and verbal short-term memory. 

Conners (2009) argued that attentional control might contribute to reading comprehension through its 

role in the higher-order comprehension process of detecting and repairing comprehension failures. 

Importantly though, other researchers propose that this type of strategy, along with locating 

information, finding main ideas, determining text structure and using visual cues are essentially 

 

2 

 
 
metacognitive processes (Kirby & Savage, 2008). Metacognitive processes require thinking about 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

aspects of one’s thinking, which may draw on EF abilities, but go beyond them. Specifically, Kirby 

and Savage (2008) suggest that these strategies are especially relevant to reading comprehension, due 

to the text remaining visible to the reader. They argue that the SVR does not address the role of these 

metacognitive strategies in reading comprehension.  

 
Metacognition relates to higher-order thinking, involving not only dynamic control over active 

cognitive processes, but also reflective insight about these processes (Kuhn, 2000). One well-

researched measure of metacognition in young children is their theory-of-mind ability (Courtin & 

Melot, 2005; Flavell, Green, & Flavell, 2000). Theory of mind (ToM) broadly involves the ability to 

impute mental states such as beliefs, desires and intentions to oneself and to others in order to explain 

and predict behaviour (Premack & Woodruff, 1978; see Doherty, 2008 for overview). A crucial 

milestone in this development occurs when children gain an understanding that someone can hold a 

mistaken (false) belief about the world. This ability occurs around four years of age (Wellman, Cross, 

& Watson, 2001) and is shown by children’s performance in explicit false belief tasks (Wimmer & 

Perner, 1983). A standard false belief task typically involves a character (e.g., Sally) leaving an object 

(e.g., a ball) in one location and, whilst away, another character (e.g., Anne) unexpectedly moving the 

object to a new location. When Sally returns the child is asked a direct question “Where will Sally 

look for her ball first?” A child that has a mature ToM will understand that Sally will go to the 

location where she left the ball (because they understand this is where she thinks it is), rather than the 

second location (where they know the ball actually is). Passing these tasks clearly shows that children 

can now think (represent) how someone thinks about (represents) something and can therefore 

understand different perspectives (Perner, 1991; Perner, Stummer, Sprung, & Doherty, 2002). This 

ability is clearly metacognitive in nature as it involves being able to think about thinking (Flavell et 

al., 2000). 

 

Theory of mind and reading comprehension 

By the time children begin to read at around five years old they will typically have acquired an 

understanding that mental states and perspectives may differ from reality and thus are able to begin to 

 

3 

 
understand that stories may include intended meanings that may not represent the child’s own 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

perspective and knowledge (Lecce, Zocchi, Pagnin, Palladino, & Taumoepeau, 2010; Woolley, & 

Cox, 2007). They are able to apply understanding and reasoning about the minds of others to begin to 

interpret the thoughts and actions of story characters (Emery, 1996). In support of this, Pelletier and 

Astington (2004) investigated the relation between the developing ToM abilities of four and five year 

olds and their understanding of characters’ actions and consciousness in spoken story narratives. They 

found that children’s ability to understand stories followed a similar developmental pathway as ToM. 

More specifically, children with an advanced ToM (as shown by their performance on ToM tasks and 

also their use of mental state terms such as “think” and “know”) were more likely to have a coherent 

understanding of the story (over and above their general language ability). Pelletier and Astington 

(2004) suggested that children’s ability to understand and coordinate action and consciousness within 

a narrative is therefore clearly linked with their ToM.  

 

To date, the two studies that have examined ToM and reading comprehension in typically developing 

children have found no clear evidence of a direct link (Guajardo & Cartwright, 2016; Kim, 2015). 

However there were indirect effects. In a cross-sectional study of 145 South Korean six-year-old 

children, Kim (2015) showed that ToM, predominantly measured with first-order false belief tasks, 

was indirectly linked to concurrent reading comprehension via listening comprehension. In other 

words, children's developing ToM facilitated their language ability, which in turn contributed to their 

reading comprehension. Likewise, Guajardo and Cartwright (2016) found that false belief 

understanding uniquely predicted concurrent oral language comprehension in their sample of 31 

children aged between three and five years. Longitudinally, Guajardo and Cartwright (2016) went on 

to show that the children's early language comprehension predicted later reading comprehension at six 

to nine years old, suggesting that early false belief understanding indirectly contributed to later reading 

comprehension via language comprehension. These findings are consistent with previous evidence 

that has shown that ToM predicts language development (Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007; Slade & 

Ruffman, 2005). In this respect, children's developing social cognition affects their emerging reading 

comprehension, but does so indirectly by facilitating the language skills needed to engage in reading 

comprehension.  

 

4 

 
However, there is some evidence for a direct link between ToM and reading comprehension. In a 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

study of adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) Ricketts, Jones, Happé, and Charman 

(2013) found that ToM ability, using broader, advanced measures of ToM, uniquely predicted reading 

comprehension over and above word reading ability and oral language skills. This suggests a direct 

contribution from ToM to reading comprehension in an atypical population with poor social 

understanding (Ricketts et al. 2013). It is plausible that similar direct effects are also present in typical 

development, but previous studies, which have included older children (Kim, 2015), or a very small 

sample with a broad age range (Guajardo & Cartwright, 2016) have missed early, potentially crucial, 

developmental effects (Lecce, Caputi & Hughes, 2011). The current longitudinal study aims to address 

these issues by investigating the direct and indirect effects of the early ToM abilities of a large sample 

of young children (mean age 3:10 months) on their later emerging reading comprehension at six years.  

 

Theory of mind might directly facilitate later reading comprehension not only through promoting the 

ability to think and reason about story characters and their actions, but also other abilities that impact 

on general comprehension skills. Successful reading comprehension requires metacognitive processes 

such as monitoring one’s own knowledge (self-monitoring) whilst reading, and responding to and 

adjusting to (repairing) other information that may be non-social or non-fictional in nature (Kirby & 

Savage, 2008; Oakhill & Cain, 2012). In other words, text may also represent and inform knowledge, 

actions and understandings, not necessarily to do with story characters or oneself as a reader. 

Importantly, ToM, as measured by false belief understanding, has also been linked to other aspects of 

metacognition beyond social understanding, for example, it is linked to knowledge about memory and 

what makes remembering easier or more difficult, i.e., meta-memory (Lecce, Bianco, Demicheli, & 

Cavallini, 2014; Lockl & Schneider, 2007), to understanding that objects can have multiple names or 

labels, i.e., metalinguistic ability (Perner et al., 2002) and also to children’s understanding about the 

source of their knowledge (Bright-Paul, Jarrold, & Wright, 2008). It is unclear whether this link is due 

to ToM being a socially specialized ability that leads to or facilitates these more general or non-social 

metacognitive abilities (Lockl & Schneider, 2007; Ricketts et al., 2013) or whether ToM draws on the 

same underlying ability as these other aspects of metacognition (Iao, Leekam, Perner, & McConachie, 

2011; Perner, 1991). Either way, ToM might therefore be expected to be directly linked to reading 

 

5 

 
 
comprehension not only because of the social aspect of reading comprehension (i.e., understanding 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

story character intentions, actions and behaviours), but also because of its links to other aspects of 

metacognition which may facilitate or contribute to the metacognitive requirements of reading 

comprehension more generally.  

 

To fully consider the degree to which ToM may predict reading comprehension, it was also essential 

to control for shared abilities in language and executive function (EF). ToM draws heavily on 

language skills (Slade & Ruffman, 2005; see Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007 for meta-analysis). 

As such, examining the unique effects of ToM over and above the linguistic comprehension 

dimension, controls for the potential shared variance between ToM and reading comprehension. 

Children’s EF ability also increases rapidly between the ages of three and four years, and is strongly 

linked to ToM development (Carlson & Moses, 2001; Shahaeian, Henry, Razmjoee, Teymoori, & 

Wang, 2015; see Devine & Hughes, 2014 for meta-analysis). EF, particularly working memory, is also 

important for reading comprehension, not only through its contribution to higher-order comprehension 

skills (Cain et al., 2004; Sesma, Mahone, Levine, Eason, & Cutting, 2009), but also through its 

contribution to emergent code-related skills (Blair & Razza, 2007; see Allan, Hume, Allan, Farrington, 

& Lonigan, 2014 for meta-analysis). Given the importance for both ToM and reading comprehension, 

EF was controlled for, in addition to age, non-verbal ability (NVA), decoding and language skills, in 

the regression and mediation analyses. 

 

The current study 

The current longitudinal study followed a UK sample of 80 young children (mean age 3 years: 10 

months) over two and half years to their emerging reading comprehension at six years old (mean age 6 

years: 3 months). We aimed to investigate the contribution of children's theory of mind to their reading 

comprehension and whether its contribution would be over and above the decoding and linguistic 

components of the SVR. We did this in two analyses. Firstly, we looked at the extent that ToM, 

measured as false belief understanding, at around four years (Time 1) predicted reading 

comprehension at six years (Time 2), after controlling for Time 1 concurrent measures of age, non-

verbal ability (NVA), executive function (EF), decoding, and language skills. Secondly, we examined 

 

6 

 
the direct and indirect effects of early ToM at four years (Time 1) on later reading comprehension at 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

six years (Time 2), controlling for the Time 2 concurrent SVR dimensions of decoding and linguistic 

comprehension, as well as shared correlates of age, NVA, and EF at Time 1. We predicted that early 

ToM would have both direct (over and above linguistic comprehension) and indirect effects on later 

reading comprehension. 

 

Participants 

Method 

The sample at Time 1 comprised of 80 preschool children (41 boys; mean age = 3:10 years, SD = 3.7 

months, age range: 3:05 - 4:06 years) attending the preschool year of two mainstream primary schools 

in South East England. The majority of the children came from well-educated families: 88% of parents 

had completed a higher education award. All children spoke English as their first language. Children 

attended school for five three-hour sessions per week. There was no formal literacy instruction given 

during this educational year; however, children experienced games to promote phonological 

awareness and were read to often. Formal literacy instruction was introduced the following year, when 

the children began full time compulsory education (Reception). At Time 2, the end of Year 1, all 80 

children (mean age = 6:03 years, SD = 3.8 months, age range: 5:09 - 6:09 years) were available for re-

testing. Eighteen additional children, who were tested at Time 1, were excluded from the study, 

because they had moved to alternative primary schools by Time 2. This resulted in an attrition rate of 

18% from preschool to Year 1, which compares favourably to other similar longitudinal studies, which 

have reported attrition rates of over 26% (e.g., Hood, Conlon & Andrews, 2008). Analysis of key 

variables revealed that there were no significant differences between the performances of the children 

who remained at the participating schools compared to those children who left during the study. 

 

Materials & Measures 

Nonverbal ability 

Children’s non-verbal ability was assessed at Time 1 using the Block Design subtest of The Wechsler 

Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence – III (WPPSI-III) (Wechsler, 2002). The task required 

 

7 

 
children to recreate a series of geometric patterns using 3-4 coloured blocks (10 items), followed by 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

designs using 2-4 two-toned blocks. Standard administration was followed.  Non-verbal ability (NVA) 

therefore consisted of a scaled score with a mean of 10 and standard deviation of 3. Split-half 

reliability for four year olds is reported as .87. 

 

Decoding 

At Time 1, children’s letter knowledge was measured using the Alphabet Knowledge subtest of the 

Phonological Abilities Test (PAT; Muter, Hulme, & Snowling, 1997). Children were presented with 

each letter of the alphabet printed individually on a card, and asked to give the name or sound of that 

letter. Letter knowledge therefore consisted of the number of letters correctly identified out of 26.  

 
At Time 2, the Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE; Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1999) was 

used to measure children’s word reading accuracy and fluency. The TOWRE is standardised for 

children from the age of six years and consists of two subtests involving word and non-word stimuli to 

provide measures of sight word reading efficiency and decoding efficiency, respectively. Data from 

the subtests were converted to age-appropriate standard scores, which were then combined to provide 

an overall reading efficiency standard score with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15. The 

reliability coefficient for the total word reading efficiency score for six year olds is reported as .98. 

 

Linguistic Comprehension 

Vocabulary. At Time 1 and Time 2, children’s receptive vocabulary was assessed using the British 

Picture Vocabulary Scale: 2nd Edition (BPVS II; Dunn, Dunn, Whetton, & Burley, 1997).  Raw 

scores were used, therefore the maximum score was 84 at Time 1 (7 sets) and 120 at Time 2 (10 sets). 

Cronbach's Alphas are reported as .96 for 3-4 year olds and .94 for six year olds. 

 
Language skills. At Time 1, children’s receptive and expressive language ability was measured 

through two subtests (linguistic concepts and recalling sentences in context) of the Clinical Evaluation 

of Language Fundamentals – Preschool Second Edition (CELF-Preschool; Wiig, Secord, & Semel, 

 

8 

 
1992). Raw scores were used, therefore the maximum scores were 20 for linguistic concepts (reported 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

Cronbach's α = .85) and 52 for recalling sentences in context (Cronbach's α = 93). 

 
At Time 2, children’s narrative comprehension ability was assessed, using the method outlined by 

Paris and Paris (2003). Children were asked to tell the story from a wordless picture storybook 

(“Robot-Bot-Bot” by Fernando Krahn). The book recounts a story about a family who buy a robot to 

help with the household chores. One of the children subsequently breaks the robot, which results in the 

robot behaving in an erratic manner causing several mishaps, until it is finally repaired by the father.  

 

After the children had finished telling the story from the book, it was removed and children were 

asked to recall the story. Children’s recall was recorded, transcribed and scored for content (six 

aspects of the narrative: characters, setting, initiating event, problem, solution, and ending) and 

awareness of story structure, giving a maximum score of 9. Following recall, the book was replaced in 

front of the child and the researcher asked a set of ten comprehension questions, turning to 

corresponding pages of the book before asking each question. Questions elicited explicit information 

(characters, setting, initiating event, problem, outcome resolution) and implicit information (feelings, 

causal inference, inference dialogue, prediction, overall theme). Children’s responses were transcribed 

in full and marked using a scoring rubric that awarded 0 to 2 points for each question, giving a 

maximum score of 20 points. Two independent coders scored 25% of children's responses for recall 

and comprehension questions. Inter-rater agreement was very good for both recall (Cohen's Kappa 

ranged between .80 and .99) and comprehension (Cohen's Kappa ranged between .76 and .97). An 

overall narrative comprehension score was calculated by summing the recall and comprehension 

scores to give a maximum total of 29. 

 

Linguistic comprehension composite scores were calculated for language ability at each time point 

with the aim of developing a richer measure of language comprehension, in line with the linguistic 

dimension of the SVR, than is provided by vocabulary measures alone.  At T1, two subtests of the 

CELF were summed to form a language skills score. Standard scores for CELF and T1 BPVS were 

 

9 

 
calculated and summed for an overall T1 linguistic composite score. At T2, standard scores were 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

calculated for the narrative comprehension and T2 BPVS and summed to form a composite score. 

 

Executive function 

At Time 1, children’s executive function (EF) was assessed using the Reverse Word Span task (Slade 

& Ruffman, 2005) and a card-sorting task, adapted from Kloo and Perner’s (2003) Dimensional Card 

Sorting task. The reverse word span task required children to reverse sets of words that were orally 

presented by the researcher. The researcher explained that she would say two words, e.g., “horse – 

sheep”, and the child would say them in a backwards order, e.g., “sheep – horse”. Following two 

practice items, the test phase included three sets of two words and a further three sets of three words. 

Scoring awarded one point for correctly reversing two words, two points for reversing three words and 

a half point was given for reversing two words that were not adjacent. The maximum score was 9. The 

card-sorting task required children to switch their response following a change of game rules.  

Initially, children were asked to sort a set of 9 cards (3 x yellow horse, 3 x red fish and 3 x blue bird) 

based on the colour of the illustrations. The test phase required children to sort an identical set of 

cards, but with a shift from their colour-based response to an animal-based response. One point was 

scored for each card correctly sorted in the ‘animal’ condition giving a maximum score of 9. Scores 

for both tasks were standardized and summed to give an overall T1 EF composite score. 

 

Theory of Mind 

At Time 1, children were administered two first-order false belief tasks. One was an unexpected 

contents task (Hogrefe, Wimmer, & Perner, 1986), where children were introduced to a toy character, 

which then remained out of sight while the child was asked to guess the contents of a “Smarties” tube. 

After the child had correctly guessed, they were shown that the tube, unexpectedly, contained 

colouring pencils. The box was then closed and the child was asked again what was inside (control 

question). The control question had to be answered correctly for credit to be given for the test 

questions. The child was then asked the first test question, which required them to say what they had 

thought was in the tube when they first saw it. The toy character was re-introduced and the child was 

reminded that the character had not seen the contents of the tube. The second test question required the 

 

10 

 
child to say what the toy character would think was in the tube. Children were awarded one point for 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

each correct answer, and a further point for justifying their answer to the second test question, if they 

had answered correctly, to give a maximum score of 3. Two independent coders scored 25% of 

children's responses. Agreement between the coders was excellent (Cohen's Kappa = 1.00). Scores 

were adjusted to reflect children's response to the control question and the adjusted scores were used 

in the analyses. 

 

The unexpected location task (Wimmer & Perner, 1983) required the child to watch a story, 

demonstrated by the researcher with toy figures, where one character (Sally) played with a ball and 

then placed it inside a blue box. Sally then left the scene and a second figure (Anne) came to play. 

Anne found the ball, played with it and then placed it in the red box. Anne leaves the scene and Sally 

returned wanting to play with ball again. On Sally’s return, the child was asked the test question, 

which requires the child to state where Sally will look for the ball and two control questions to ensure 

they had followed the story. Control questions had to be answered correctly for credit to be given for 

the test question. One point was awarded for a correct answer (blue, where Sally thinks it is) and a 

further point awarded for an appropriate justification, if the test question had been answered correctly, 

to give a maximum score of 2. Two independent coders scored 25% of children's responses. 

Agreement between the coders was excellent (Cohen's Kappa = .92). Scores were adjusted to account 

for the control questions and adjusted scores were used. ToM was defined as performance on the two 

tasks added together and therefore had a possible range of 0 to 5. 

 

Reading comprehension 

At Time 2, the York Assessment of Reading for Comprehension: Passage Reading (YARC; Snowling 

et al., 2011) was used to assess children’s comprehension skills. The standardised test comprised of 

graded passages, alternating between fiction and non-fiction, for reading aloud by children aged five 

to 11 years. Children initially completed a single word reading task (Foster, 2007) to determine the 

starting passage level for the YARC. Children were then required to read two sequential passages 

from Form A (one fiction and one non-fiction). Following each passage, children were asked a set of 

eight comprehension questions tapping literal and inferential comprehension skills. Time 2 Reading 

 

11 

 
 
Comprehension was therefore defined as the standard score, M = 100, SD = 15, on YARC passage

reading. Across the stories suitable for this age group, the median Cronbach's Alpha is reported as .64. 

 

Procedure 

At both time points children were tested individually in a quiet area immediately outside of their 

classroom and administration of the test sessions was fully counterbalanced. Children were initially 

tested (Time 1) during the spring term in their nursery year. In Year 1, children were tested at the end 

of the summer term (Time 2). For both time points, testing sessions were part of a wider study 

investigating an extensive range of cognitive measures linked to early literacy development and, 

overall, children completed three to four 15 to 20 minute sessions at each time point.   

 

Results 

Descriptive statistics 

Descriptive statistics for all variables are presented in Table 1. Distributions for variables were 

acceptable, with the exception of letter knowledge at Time 1, which was positively skewed. Data were 

log transformed to address the positive skew. The transformed variable was used in the analyses. 

There were no significant sex differences on any of the main variables, therefore gender was not 

considered in any further analyses.

Correlation analyses          

Concurrent relations. Zero-order correlations are reported in Table 2. At Time 1, ToM significantly 

correlated with linguistic ability, decoding, and EF. T1 EF was significantly correlated with linguistic 

comprehension and decoding at T1. As expected from the SVR model, reading comprehension at T2 

correlated with T2 linguistic comprehension and T2 decoding. 

 

Longitudinal relations. In addition to concurrent relations, T2 reading comprehension was 

significantly correlated with T1 linguistic comprehension and T1 decoding. T2 reading comprehension 

was also significantly correlated with earlier T1 EF and T1 ToM. T1 ToM was strongly correlated 

with T2 linguistic comprehension; however, its relation with T2 word reading efficiency (decoding) 

was not significant.

T1 ToM to T2 reading comprehension       

To investigate the longitudinal relation between T1 ToM and T2 reading comprehension, a 

hierarchical regression analysis was performed to determine if the addition of an early measure of 

ToM improved the prediction of Year 1 (T2) reading comprehension beyond that accounted for by 

differences in age, NVA, the dimensions of the SVR (decoding and linguistic comprehension) and EF. 

To account for the effects of age, all variables (excluding NVA, reading comprehension and reading 

efficiency where age had been accounted for in standard scores) were residualized for concurrent age, 

thus becoming age-independent variables (Durand, Hulme, Larkin, & Snowling, 2005). Analysis was 

performed using SPSS REGRESSION and SPSS EXPLORE for evaluation of assumptions. 

 

In the regression, NVA, and T1 decoding, language comprehension and EF skills were entered at Step 

1 and T1 ToM measure was entered at Step 2. Following each step in the analysis, residuals and 

influence statistics were explored to check and address any violation of assumptions of normality. A 

significant skew was found in the distribution of standardized residuals and further investigation was 

conducted to identify one multivariate outlier. The regression was rerun with data from the remaining 

participants (n = 79).

Results of the analysis are reported in Table 3. Step 1 produced a significant model, F(4, 74) = 9.32, p

= < .001 and an R2 value of .34. Examination of the coefficients showed that T1 decoding skill (letter 

knowledge) uniquely predicted significant variance in reading comprehension at the end of Year 1 

(T2). T1 NVA, linguistic comprehension and EF did not make a significant unique contribution to T2 

reading comprehension. With the addition of T1 ToM at Step 2, an improved model was constructed, 

F(5, 73) = 10.39, p < .001, accounting for a further 8% of variance in T2 reading comprehension.

Is the link between early T1 ToM and later T2 reading comprehension direct or indirect? 

A mediation analysis was conducted to investigate whether the relation between early ToM and later 

reading comprehension was direct over and above the dimensions of the SVR or indirect via the 

language dimension concurrent to the measure of reading comprehension. The analysis was performed 

by Hayes's PROCESS in SPSS (Hayes, 2012) using 1000 bootstrap samples to compute bias corrected 

and accelerated (BCa) confidence intervals (CI) around the indirect effect. Significant indirect effects 

are indicated when the confidence interval does not include zero (Preacher & Hayes, 2008; see Field, 

2013).

Discussion 

 
The aim of the current study, spanning a two and a half year period, was to investigate the relation 

between children’s early ToM ability at around four years old and their later emergent reading 

comprehension at six years old, over and above the effects of the dimensions of the SVR (decoding 

and linguistic comprehension). The influence of age, non-verbal ability (NVA) and executive function 

(EF) skills, measured at around four years, was also controlled within the analyses. We were 

specifically interested whether this effect was direct or indirect via linguistic comprehension 

concurrent with later reading comprehension.

Does ToM predict ability in reading comprehension? 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

 

Regression analyses showed that earlier ToM, at Time 1 (mean age 3:10) uniquely contributed to later 

reading comprehension ability at six years, even after controlling for age, measures of NVA, EF and 

the two dimensions of the SVR (decoding and linguistic comprehension). In sum, early ToM, 

measured as false belief understanding uniquely predicted later reading comprehension. 

 
 
Is the relation between ToM and reading comprehension direct or indirect via linguistic ability?  
 
Results from the mediation analyses showed a significant indirect effect from ToM at Time 1, to Time 

2 reading comprehension via Time 2 linguistic comprehension, suggesting that children's developing 

ToM also facilitated the language skills that are crucial for successful reading comprehension. These 

findings provide further evidence of the predictive relation between children's ToM ability and 

language development (Hughes, Ensor, & Marks, 2010; Milligan et al., 2007; Slade & Ruffman, 

2005). Additionally, they replicate a recent cross-sectional study with six-year-old children that 

showed an indirect pathway from ToM to concurrent reading comprehension, via language 

comprehension (Kim, 2015). Importantly, our novel findings extend this effect across a crucial early 

developmental period. Children typically begin to pass false belief tasks between the ages of three and 

five years old (Wellman et al., 2001). In other words, we showed that children's developing social 

cognition across the early years affects their later emerging reading comprehension through the 

facilitation of language skills. This explanation fits within the SVR account of reading comprehension 

(Gough & Tunmer, 1986; Hoover & Gough, 1990), such that ToM contributes to the linguistic 

dimension of the framework. 

 

However, importantly, our mediation analysis also showed that a significant direct relation remained 

between early ToM and later reading comprehension, over and above the linguistic comprehension 

dimension of the SVR. This is the first longitudinal study to show a direct contribution of theory of 

mind to reading comprehension. Preschool ToM at Time 1 predicted abilities specific to reading 

comprehension that go beyond skills required to comprehend spoken language. This novel finding is 

an important contribution to the understanding of the development of reading comprehension and 

indicates that the direct effect of early ToM to later reading comprehension may be as a result of when 

 

17 

 
children gain a ToM.  At six years old, during this early stage of reading comprehension acquisition, 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

decoding ability is the strongest predictor of reading comprehension leaving less to be explained by 

linguistic skills and, typically, the balance shifts with development, such that linguistic comprehension 

becomes more fundamental once word reading is fluent and efficient (Adlof, Catts, & Lee, 2010; 

Ouelette & Beers, 2010; Vellutino et al., 2007). It is plausible that previous studies (Guajardo & 

Cartwright, 2016; Kim, 2015), investigating the influence of ToM of older children, or with small 

samples with a broad age range, may have missed these early potentially crucial developmental 

effects. Additionally, the non-standard and linguistically-demanding ToM tasks employed in previous 

studies may have masked the effects of ToM or been biased to general language ability. Indeed, our 

finding is consistent with previous research suggesting that early ToM directly relates to later 

cognitive performance (Lecce et al., 2014; Lecce et al., 2011; Lockl & Schneider, 2007).  

 

Why does early theory of mind directly predict later reading comprehension? 

False belief understanding marks a crucial step in meta-cognitive development (e.g., Bartsch & Estes, 

1996; Flavell et al, 2000). This may be because it is part of, or draws upon, domain general meta-

cognitive abilities (Iao et al., 2011; Perner, 1991; Perner et al., 2002) or because it is a socially 

specialized ability (e.g., He, Bolz & Baillargeon, 2011) that facilitates other aspects of meta-cognition 

e.g., meta-memory (Lecce et al 2014; Lockl & Schneider, 2007) or source monitoring (Bright-Paul et 

al, 2008). Nevertheless, we argue that it is the coming online of these abilities that is crucial and that 

false belief understanding reflects a “watershed” in their availability. The early acquisition of theory of 

mind allows children greater exposure to and opportunities to use metacognitive strategies that 

facilitate later development of higher order comprehension skills (e.g., self monitoring and repair 

strategies), which promote increased performance in reading comprehension (Oakhill & Cain, 2012; 

Perfetti, Landi, & Oakhill, 2005). In other words, gaining false belief understanding early provides 

children with longer exposure to and, therefore, more opportunities and experience in using 

metacognitive skills relevant for reading comprehension, i.e., comprehension monitoring (Kirby & 

Savage, 2008) and meta-linguistic understanding (Yuill, 2009). Consistent with this, Lockl and 

Schneider (2007) concluded from their study that those children acquiring an early ToM performed 

 

18 

 
better in the later meta-memory tasks, suggesting that gaining a ToM might be a crucial step in 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

metacognitive development. 

 
ToM and the SVR account of reading comprehension 

Overall, our findings show a robust effect where ToM is indirectly linked to reading comprehension 

via linguistic comprehension, such that the effects of ToM are accounted for within the SVR 

framework via one of its key dimensions. Children's social cognition facilitates linguistic 

comprehension, which may play an important role in reading. Importantly though, early ToM also 

directly contributed to reading comprehension over and above the dimensions of the SVR. As we have 

argued, this is likely to be because it marks a watershed in metacognitive abilities relevant to reading 

comprehension. These metacognitive abilities will clearly be relevant to making sense of stories, 

thoughts and actions, specifically including socially relevant abilities such as thinking about 

characters' thoughts and feelings and linking those to actions within stories. Crucially, however, it will 

also be relevant to other broader metacognitive abilities relevant to reading, such as meta-memory 

(Lecce et al., 2014) and comprehension monitoring (Kirby & Savage, 2008).  

 

As a result of their study, Ricketts et al. (2013) suggest that the SVR framework should be extended to 

include mental state understanding when accounting for reading comprehension in an Autistic 

Spectrum Disorder population. These claims for ToM, indicating a role for meta-cognition, are 

consistent with the theory that higher-order comprehension processes, such as inference making, are 

used to integrate information from the text with the reader's general knowledge to the create a mental 

model of the text or situation model (Kintsch & Rawson, 2005; Perfetti & Stafura, 2014). The results 

from the current study support the view that ToM is a significant predictor of reading comprehension 

in typically developing children, and therefore should be included in the SVR model. An account of 

metacognition is essential to provide a full explanation of reading comprehension (Kirby & Savage, 

2008) and the SVR may need to be expanded to account for metacognitive skills, particularly for the 

acquisition and early development of reading comprehension. 

 
Limitations 

 

19 

 
One of the main strengths of the current longitudinal study was initially assessing pre-readers before 

 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

the beginning of formal literacy instruction. However, research with very young children brings 

inherent problems with regard to finding reliable measures. To limit demands on the children, 

assessment sessions were restricted in number and length; therefore, some variables were measured at 

a single time. However, during these early years, children’s development may be uneven and episodic 

and highly influenced by their environment, therefore it may have been more reliable to measure 

children’s abilities within each construct through a variety of assessments over different days.  

Overall, however, our sample performed highly in the standardized assessment tasks and were from 

families who reported above-average educational levels. As such, this may potentially limit the degree 

to which our results are extended to the population in general. 

 
The current study did not include additional measures of metacognition. Future research in this field 

should address this issue with the assessment of other aspects of metacognitive ability (for example, 

measures of source monitoring; Bright-Paul et al., 2008) at each time point. Additionally, six years is a 

relatively young age to assess reading comprehension. Decoding ability is the strongest predictor of 

reading comprehension through this early stage, but as word reading becomes more fluent and 

efficient, linguistic comprehension develops greater significance. Follow up assessments are vital to 

investigate how metacognitive ability relates to reading comprehension as the balance shifts between 

decoding and linguistic abilities.  

 

Conclusion and Implications 

In conclusion, this longitudinal study provides robust evidence that theory of mind through the early 

years promoted later linguistic comprehension, which in turn contributed to reading comprehension. 

Importantly, we also show a novel finding that ToM directly contributed to performance of reading 

comprehension, over and above age, NVA, decoding and linguistic comprehension and EF, in a 

typically developing population. This is the first longitudinal study to show that gaining early ToM 

(measured by false belief understanding) predicts better reading comprehension ability, two and a half 

years later. The current study supports previous research that has argued that early ToM leads to better 

performance in later academic achievement (Lecce et al., 2011) and cognitive development (Lecce et 

 

20 

 
 
al., 2014; Lockl & Schneider, 2007). Specifically, we show that early ability predicts later reading 

 

Theory of Mind and Reading Comprehension 

comprehension performance. Children may benefit from early ToM because it allows earlier and 

greater experience of applying metacognitive strategies, which become crucial for later reading 

comprehension. 

 
These findings have important applied implications. Robust relations between linguistic ability and EF 

for both ToM (Milligan et al., 2007; Devine & Hughes, 2014) and reading comprehension (Cain et al., 

2004; Kendeou et al., 2009; Paris & Paris, 2003; Sesma et al., 2009) have been well established. As a 

result, instruction and training in these skills are being increasingly promoted through the early years 

of education (e.g., Diamond, Barnett, Thomas, & Munro, 2007). The predictive link between ToM and 

reading comprehension, over and above the effects of language and EF, suggests that ToM is a crucial 

component in the development of reading comprehension. Likewise, parent and child discussion 

during shared reading may be an important context to learn about ToM and reading comprehension 

more generally (Symons, 2004; Symons, Peterson, Slaughter, Roche, & Doyle, 2005). Therefore, 

instruction and training in the skills and knowledge that underlie false belief understanding (e.g., 

Lecce et al., 2014) would be beneficial as an additional approach in promoting emerging reading 

comprehension.
