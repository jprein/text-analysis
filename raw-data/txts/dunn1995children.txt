Children as Psychologists: The Later Correlates of 

Individual Differences in Understanding of 

Emotions and Other Minds

The sequelae of  individual  differences  in  children’s understanding  of emo- 
tions  and  of  other  minds  were  investigated  in  a  longitudinal  study  of  46 
children.  At  40  months,  differences  in  the  children’s  understanding  of 
emotions were not significantly related  to their ability  to explain behaviour 
in terms of beliefs within a false belief paradigm. Follow-up in kindergarten 
showed that early emotion  understanding  was related  to children’s positive 
perception  of  their peer  experiences,  to their understanding  of  mixed emo- 
tions, and their moral sensibility as kindergarteners.  Early understanding of 
other minds was, in contrast, related to negative initial perceptions of school, 
and sensitivity  to teacher  criticism.  These differences in  sequelae highlight 
the importance of differentiating the emotional and cognitive components of 
social understanding in framing developmental questions. 

INTRODUCTION 

The young child as psychologist has become a topic of tremendous interest 
in  developmental psychology, with the rapid growth of  research on chil- 
dren’s theory of  mind, and on their understanding of  emotions. Yet  these 
two  aspects of  understanding have  chiefly  been  separately  investigated. 
The normative development of  children’s understanding of  emotions and 
its relation to the growth of  understanding of  desires and beliefs has been 
illuminated by  research such as that of  Bartsch and Wellman (1995) and 
their colleagues (Wellman, Harris, Banerjee, & Sinclair, this issue), but we

remain ignorant about the extent to which these aspects of  psychological 
understanding are  associated  in  the  preschool  years-or  later-in 
terms 
of  individual differences. Are the children who  are early  sophisticates in 
the  understanding  of  emotions  also  precocious  about  understanding 
others’  mental  states?  Should we  view  early  understanding of  emotions 
and  of  other  minds  as differentiated  aspects of  children’s  psychological 
understanding? 

One  study  of  individual  differences  suggests  that  understanding  of 
emotion  and  of  other  minds  in  the  early  preschool  years  are  indeed 
differentiated (Dunn, Brown, Slomkowski, Tesla,  & Youngblade,  1991). 
The abilities of 50 40-month-olds on assessments of their understanding of 
emotion and their ability to explain puppets’ behaviour in terms of  false 
belief were not significantly related. That is, some children in this sample 
were relatively  successful on the  emotion understanding assessment, but 
not on the task that involved explanation of  action in terms of  false belief 
and vice versa.  Such evidence supports Astington and Jenkins’ argument 
(this issue) that it may be a mistake to think of  the development of  social 
understanding as  “all of  a piece”.  It also raises the question of  what the 
implications of these different aspects of understanding others’ inner states 
may be for children’s social and emotional lives. 

Here  we  face  a  striking  gap  in  what  is  known-either  in  terms  of 
normative or individual differences in development. It is striking, because 
not only are children’s close relationships likely to be transformed by  the 
developments  in  their  understanding of  mental  and  feeling  states,  but  a 
wide range of other aspects of their later developmental outcomes may be 
implicated  too.  Children’s  adjustment  to  the  world  of  school,  to  the 
judgements  of  teachers, to  the peer  culture, and  to the  moral  issues that 
will confront them in middle childhood may all be linked to some features 
of  their  early  understanding  of  others’  inner  states.  The  research  of 
Astington and  Jenkins,  and  Lalonde and  Chandler (this  issue) that  links 
children’s understanding of  mental states to certain aspects of their social 
and emotional lives within the preschool years is then especially valuable. 
The  focus  of  this  article  is  on  the  related  issue  of  whether  and  how 
individual  differences  in  children’s  understanding  of  emotions  and  of 
other  minds  in  the  preschool  period  are  related  to  later  differences  in 
children’s social understanding. 

A  matter  of  particular  interest  is  the  question  of  whether  these  two 
aspects of  early understanding carry different implications for later devel- 
opment, and show differenr patterns of  later correlates. Very little is known 
about the sequelae of early differences in children’s understanding of either 
emotions or  mental states. These differences could be  merely aspects of 
different  rates  of  development  in  the  preschool  years.  If  so,  once  these 
developmental milestones are passed by 3- to 4-year-olds, it is possible that

children’s social understanding, relationships, and  school experiences  in 
middle childhood are unrelated to these early individual differences. The 
question of  whether such early differences do show continuity with chil- 
dren’s  understanding  and  relationships  when  they  reach  the  world  of 
school,  and  face  the  complexities  of  the  social  and  moral  issues  of 
middle  childhood,  remains  unexplored.  So,  too,  does  the  question  of 
whether  the  sequelae of  early  emotion  understanding differ  from  those 
of  early understanding of  mental states. 

The evidence of  the studies of  Astington and Jenkins, and Lalonde and 
Chandler  (this  issue)  show  that  some  but  not  other  aspects  of  social 
interaction among preschoolers are associated with  performance on  false 
belief tasks. In this article we take another step towards differentiating the 
various features of  children’s psychological understanding by  examining 
the  later  correlates  of  early  differences  in  understanding emotions  and 
understanding other minds. The data that  will be  summarised come from 
the project, to which we  have already referred, in which 50 children were 
studied  as  40-month-olds. The  children  were  then  followed  from  their 
second to their eighth year. Earlier reports of  this project have described 
the  antecedents of  individual differences  in  emotion  understanding and 
false belief task performance among the children as 3-year-olds (Dunn et 
al., 1991). 

Among  the  various  aspects of  the  children’s development, which  we 
studied when the children were 5,6, and 7 years old, certain domains are of 
particular  interest  in  relation  to  the  early  differences  in  sociocognitive 
understanding.  The  first  of  these  involves children’s  experiences  in  the 
new  world  of  school  to  which  they  have  had  to  adjust.  It  is  widely 
acknowledged that differences in children’s initial reactions to school are 
important to  take  seriously (Alexander & Entwistle,  1988; Ladd,  1990); 
however,  little  is  known  about  their  antecedents.  We  considered  two 
aspects  of  the  children’s  responses  to  school.  First  we  examined  their 
perceptions of  school within  the framework of  a  broad-based interview. 
In this open-ended interview, some described success and enjoyment in the 
world of  teachers, peers, and  academic work  (Donelan-McCall & Dunn, 
submitted).  Others  viewed  their  experiences  in  a  more  negative  way, 
describing lack  of  friends,  difficulties with  peers,  or  problems  with  the 
new demands of school work. The possibility that differences such as these 
are associated with early sociocognitive differences has not until now been 
examined. 

A second related issue concerning school that we investigated was more 
specific in  focus; this  was  the  children’s response to  the judgements  of 
teachers, and their own perceptions of  their inadequacy in  the face of  the 
demands  and  criticism  of  teachers.  We  employed  a  set  of  procedures 
developed  by  Heyman,  Dweck,  and  Cain  (1992)  to  assess  children’s 

response to teacher criticism and their tendency to self-blame in the face of 
judgement, and found marked individual differences in children’s reactions 
to  criticism. Whether  such differences  are  linked to early  differences  in 
either the children’s understanding of  other minds, or of  emotions has not 
yet been investigated. 

The next domain of particular interest in relation to early understanding 
of  emotion  and  other  minds  is  one  that  is  considered  to  be  of  major 
importance  in  middle  childhood,  both  for  children’s  relationships  and 
their  sense  of  self-the 
appreciation  of  mixed  conflicting  emotions 
(Fischer,  Shaver,  & Carnochan,  1990; Harris,  1989). It  is  not  until  the 
early school years that children begin to acknowledge that experiences may 
provoke a mix of both positive and negative emotions (Harter & Buddin, 
1987; Peng, Johnson, Pollock, Glasspool, & Hams, 1992); such knowledge 
is thought to be key in the development of moral understanding (Arsenio & 
Lover,  1994)’ and of conceptions of personal relationships. 

Finally,  the  third  domain concerns children’s  moral  sensibility  in  the 
kindergarten and first-grade years (Dunn, Brown, & Maguire, in press). As 
6-year-olds the children in the study differed notably in their response to 
transgressions involving friends: Some were concerned with the feelings of 
a victim and with the importance of reparation, others showed little such 
concern.  It  can  be  argued  that  differences  in  moral  sensibility  may  be 
linked to  both  emotional and  cognitive aspects of development (Arsenio 
&  Lover,  1994); thus  the  question  of  how  these  moral  responses  in 
kindergarten  were  related  to  earlier  understanding  of  inner  states  is  of 
interest. We  already know that the marked differences between the chil- 
dren  in  their  appreciation of  mixed emotions and  in  moral  sensibility in 
kindergarten  were  correlated  with  the  preschool  assessment  of  emotion 
understanding  (Brown  &  Dunn,  submitted;  Dunn  et  al.,  in  press).  The 
issue  on  which  we  centre  here  is  whether  there  are  differences in  the 
patterns  of  association  with  these  kindergarten  measures,  for  the  pre- 
school assessment of  children’s explanations of  action  in  terms  of  false 
belief  on  the  one  hand,  and  for  the  early  emotion  understanding on  the 
other. 

In summary, the following question is addressed. Are there differences 
in the correlations over time between 3-year-olds’ understanding of  other 
minds and  their  understanding of  emotions and  the  following  aspects of 
later  developmental  outcome:  their  perceptions  of  kindergarten  experi- 
ences, their response to teacher criticism, their appreciation of  conflicting 
emotions, and their moral sensibility?

METHOD 

Subjects 
The  subjects  were  second-born  children,  participating  in  a  longitudinal 
study  in  central  Pennsylvania.  Data  were  complete  at  all  time  points  for 
46 children: 22 boys and 24 girls. The mean age gap between  the siblings 
was 43 months  (range  16-93  months).  The  families  were  recruited  from 
sequential birth announcements in the local newspaper and included a wide 
range of backgrounds:  the occupational status of  the fathers was assessed 
with the National  Opinion Research Corporation (NORC) prestige ratings 
based on the  1970 census (Hauser & Featherman, 1977): the mean paternal 
rating  was  51.5  (SD  =  16.3). For  the  US  white  labour  force,  the  mean 
NORC rating is 41.7 (SD = 13.9); thus, although the Pennsylvania sample 
has a higher occupational prestige rating than the working US population, it 
is  reasonably  representative  in  the  sense that  its mean  is only  about 0.7 
standard deviation higher than the mean of the US white  labour  force. 

Procedures 
The data in this study were drawn from three time points in the longitudinal 
project.  The  children’s  understanding  of  emotions,  and  their  ability  to 
explain  action  in  terms  of  beliefs,  as revealed  in false  belief  tasks,  were 
assessed  when  the  children  were  40  months  old  (Dunn,  Brown,  Slom- 
kowski,  Tesla,  &  Youngblade,  1991).  The  families  were  subsequently 
visited at the beginning and end of the children’s kindergarten year. Table 
1 gives  an  outline  of  the  assessments  from  the  project  that  will  be  con- 
sidered in this article. All assessments were made in the children’s homes. 
As the various assessments have been described in other publications,  they 
will be briefly summarised  here, and references given to sources of  more 
detailed descriptions.

Preschool Social Cognition Tasks.  At 40 months, two visits were made 
in  which  the  false  belief  explanation  tasks  (Bartsch  & Wellman,  1989) 
were  conducted  on  the  first  visit  and  the  emotion  understanding  tasks 
(Denham, 1986) on the second. 

Kindergarten Interviews.  One month after the start of  their kindergar- 
ten year, and in the following May at the end of  their kindergarten year, the 
children  were  interviewed  about  their  perceptions  of  school  (Donelan- 
McCall & Dunn, submitted). At  the end-of-year visits, the children were 
also  administered  an  assessment  of  children’s  response  to  the  critical 
judgements  of  teachers  (Heyman  et  al.,  1992),  an  assessment  which 
focused  on  children’s  understanding  of  conflicting  emotions  (Gordis, 
Rosen, & Grand, 1989), and an assessment of response to moral transgres- 
sions (Kochanska, 1991). 

Measures 

Preschool  Emotion  Understanding.  The  two  procedures  reported  in 
Denham (1986) were followed (for details see also Dunn et al.,  1991). In 
one, the affective labelling task, children were asked to  identify verbally 
and by pointing to the appropriate expressions of happiness, sadness, anger, 
and  fear  depicted  on  four  faces  drawn  on  felt  circles.  They  received  2 
points  for each  correct  response for  a total  correct  of  16. In  the  second 
procedure the affective-perspective-taking task, puppets were used to enact 
a series of  16 vignettes, centring on emotion-inducing situations, in which 
the protagonist expressed either happiness, sadness, anger, or fear. At the 
end of  each story the children were asked how  the protagonist felt. Two 
points  were  given  for  a  correct  response  to  each  story,  making  a  total 
possible  score  of  32.  Following  Denham  (1986),  an  aggregate  score  of 
emotion understanding was created by combining these scores on the two 
tasks.  The  mean  value  for  the  children’s emotion  understanding on  this 
affective  aggregate  score  was  32.2  (SD  10.4,  range  9 4 7 ) .  Cronbach’s 
alpha for the affective aggregate was 0.91. 

Preschool  False  Belief  Explanation  Tasks.  At  40 months, children’s 
understanding of  the relation of  belief to  action was tested  in  a series of 
tasks that required them to explain a puppet character’s behaviour based on 
the  character’s  false  belief.  The  “unexpected  change”  procedures 
described by  Bartsch and Wellman (1989) were followed (for details see 
Dunn et al., 1991). Five explanation tasks involving stories were presented 
in a counterbalanced order across children, in each of which the child was 
shown two small boxes, one marked  with  a familiar and  obvious picture 

CHILDREN AS  PSYCHOLOGISTS 

193 

(e.g. a bandaid box) and the other a plain box of  the same size and colour. 
For example, the story involving bandaids went as follows: At the begin- 
ning of the session the experimenter told the child “Pick the box that you 
think  has bandaids in  it”.  As  the child discovered, the marked container 
was empty, whereas the other contained the bandaids. The child was then 
introduced  to  a  puppet, and  given the  explanation task,  watching as  the 
puppet  started  to  look  in  the  marked,  but  empty  container.  Then  the 
observer  asked  the  child  to  explain  the  puppet’s  action.  “Look  here’s 
Bill.  Bill  has  a  cut,  see?  And  he  wants  a  bandaid.”  Then,  as  Bill 
approaches the  bandaid  box  and  starts  to  open  it,  “Why  do  you  think 
he’s  looking in  there? ” If  the child failed to respond or mentioned only 
something  other  than  the  puppet’s  beliefs,  the  observer  prompted  with: 
“What  does Bill think?”  If  a false belief  was mentioned, the  child  was 
asked “Are the bandaids really there? ” to be certain that the child had not 
forgotten the actual contents of the container. Children giving one or more 
explanations of  the  puppet’s action  in  terms  of  what  he  or  she  thought 
(prompted or unprompted) were coded as ofleering explanations in terms of 
false belief; that is, the variable entered in the analyses was dichotomised, 
0 = no explanation, I  = one or more explanations. A total of  14 children 
gave  explanations in  terms  of  what  the  puppet  mistakenly thought;  the 
median number of  these  explanations per child was 4 out of  5  tasks, the 
mean number 3 (SD 1.37).’ 

Kindergarten  Interview.  Children  provided  information  about  their 
school  experiences  by  responding  to  both  open-ended  questions  and 
closed-ended  rating  questions.  The  former  focused  on  more  general 
aspects of  their  school experiences (e.g.  what  they  did  and  did  not  like 
about kindergarten, and what they would tell a younger boy  or girl about 
kindergarten). Their responses were  coded for the  frequency of  positive 
and  negative responses about school activities, peers, learning activities, 
teachers, best  friends, loneliness. For  the rating questions, children were 
asked to rate on 4-point scales the frequency with which they were teased, 
had trouble with the work, minded leaving their parents, etc. (see Donelan- 
McCall & Dunn, submitted, for details). Prior to the factor analyses used 
for data reduction, the narrative responses were expressed as a proportion 
of  the total number of  words the child used, to control for differences in 
talkativeness. 

Both  narrative  and  rating  variables were  then  included in  a principal 
components analysis with  orthogonal rotation. For  the  first  kindergarten

response to prompts.

interview,  a  single  general  factor  dominated  the  narrative  and  rating 
variables.  Only  one  factor  had  an  eigenvalue  greater  than  1.0  and  it 
accounted for  69%  of  the  total  variance.  This  factor  was  interpreted  as 
reflecting a negative dimension of  children’s school experiences, because 
its  highest  loading  variables  included  negative  statements about  school 
activities,  having  problems  with  the  new  work,  having  difficulty  with 
making new friends, disliking coming to school every day. 

For  the  kindergarten  interview  given  at  the  end  of  the  school  year, 
children’s perceptions of  school experiences became differentiated. Two 
factors had eigenvalues greater than 1 .O  and they accounted for 78% of the 
total  variance.  Rotation revealed  a  dimension of  positive  school experi- 
ences independent of  a factor of  negative school experiences. The highest 
loading  variables  on  this  positive  perception  factor  included  positive 
statements  about  peers,  teachers,  best  friends,  and  the  children’s  own 
adjustment to school. Variables loading on each factor were z-scored and 
summed to create the factor scales. 

Response  to  Criticism.  The  procedure  developed  by  Heyman  et  al. 
(1 992)  for  investigating  children’s  reactions  to  teacher  criticism  was 
followed. This involved interactive scenarios in  which children pretended 
to create a product and then were presented with a critical response by  an 
adult. The  observer read  two  stories in  which  the  main  character  shared 
gender and name of  the subject child, and directed the child to act out the 
role of the main character with a puppet simultaneously. The theme of each 
story involved the child working hard on a task and then making a small 
error. One story involved writing numbers, the other involved painting a 
family.  In  one  story  the  main  character  then  received  criticism  from  a 
teacher, enacted  as  a  puppet  by  the  observer. Following  each  scenario, 
the children made evaluations of  the products they  had  made.  The order 
of  stories  with  and  without  feedback  from  the  “teacher”  was  varied 
randomly. 

The measure employed in  this  study  was the product  rating: Children 
were asked to rate what they had done (the imaginary product) on a scale 
from 1  (a big frown) to 6 (a big smile). Thus a child who scored his or her 
product high was rating his or her product as good even though the teacher 
had  criticised it.  The mean  value for the  sample was  3.4  (SD  1.8, range 
1 -6). 

Kindergarten  Understanding  of  Conjicting  Emotions.  A  storytelling 
interview based on that developed by Gordis, Rosen, and Grand (1989) was 
used  to  assess children’s understanding of  situations in  which  one could 
feel two emotions of  opposite valence. Two sets of  stories were presented; 
in  the  first,  the  child  was  told  that  the  protagonist  felt  two  conflicting 

CHILDREN AS  PSYCHOLOGISTS 

195 

emotions  and  was  asked  to  explain  why;  in  the  second, the  child  was 
told  the  story alone  and  was  asked  what  the  character  felt.  There  were 
three stories in each set. Finally the children were asked whether they had 
ever experienced both  a positive and  negative emotion at the  same time, 
and to tell the observer the story of  what happened. Children’s responses 
were tape-recorded and  transcribed. Scores received were 0 for no emo- 
tions explained,  1 for one emotion, or 2 for two opposite-valenced emo- 
tions explained for each story in the first 2 story conditions (possible score 
12 points). In the own story condition, 2 points were given if  the children 
provided plausible explanations for two opposite-valenced emotions. The 
sum of the child’s responses in these 3 story conditions was the Total Score 
used  (possible score  14); mean  value  for the  sample was  8.81  (SD 2.49, 
range 3-14).  Cronbach’s alpha for the scale was 0.74. 

Kindergarten  Moral  Sensibility.  The  procedures  described  by 
Kochanska  (1 99 1) for  assessing children’s responses to  moral  transgres- 
sions were  followed. Three semi-projective narratives were  presented to 
each  child,  the  child’s  responses  audio-taped and  transcribed. For  each 
story  (accompanied by  photographs) the  child  was  asked  to  assume the 
perspective of  the child who commits a transgression (cheats, takes a toy, 
knocks over and neglects to help a child), and a series of standard questions 
asked concerning how the child would feel in the place of the transgressor, 
whether  he  or  she  would  feel  that  way  if  undetected, how  intense  the 
feelings would be, and how he or she would end the story. Two measures 
from these procedures are considered here: moral  orientation, the sum of 
the child’s scores for the 3 stories each scored on a 5-point scale with  1 
depicting the least and  5  the most  “intemalised”  moral reasoning score, 
and story completion  the sum of  the child’s scores for the  3 stories each 
scored on a 3-point scale with 1 depicting no resolution of the transgression 
and 3 depicting a reparative ending. Mean values for the two scales were 
moral  orientation 9.21  (SD 3.01, range 3-14),  and story completion  6.1 1 
(SD 1.91, range 3-9).  Cronbach’s alphas for the two scores were 0.62 and 
0.65. 

Results 
Scores on the preschool emotion understanding task were correlated with 
the  measures  of  the  four  outcomes from  the  kindergarten  assessments; 
similarly, false belief  explanation task  scores were  correlated with  these 
measures. Table 2 shows the results. 

Emotion understanding at 40 months was  significantly correlated with 
the children’s positive perception of  their school social experiences at the 
end  of  the  kindergarten  year,  with  their  understanding  of  conflicting

emotions as a 6-year-old, and with their moral orientation and moral story 
completion scores. The measures of negative perception of school experi- 
ence, and the product rating measure of response to teacher criticism were 
not  significantly  correlated  with  the  preschool  emotion  understanding 
measure. 

In contrast, successful performance on the false belief explanation task 
at 40 months was significantly correlated with the negative perception of 
school experiences at  the  start of  kindergarten. It  was  also  significantly 
correlated with the measure of response to teacher criticism: Children who 
had provided appropriate explanations in terms of  false belief in the tasks 
as 40-month-olds gave  themselves poorer  product ratings  in  the  face of 
teacher criticism  as kindergarteners. That  is, they  took  into  account the 
teacher’s criticism by judging‘their product as poor, whereas the children 
who  had  not  been  successful  at  the  false  belief  tasks  gave  themselves 
“good”  ratings  in  spite  of  the  teacher’s criticism.  Success on  the  false 
belief tasks was also significantly related to scores on the appreciation of 
mixed emotions, but not to the other kindergarten measures. 

Tests of  the  significance of  the  difference in  the correlations (Cohen, 
1988) were significant at P c 0.05 for the kindergarten negative perception 
scores, and  for the response to teacher criticism, and at P < 0.10 for the 
positive perception of  peer experiences at the end of  kindergarten. 

DISCUSSION 

In this study we asked whether early differences in children’s performance 
on  assessments of  understanding emotions and  in  their ability to explain 
behaviour in  terms of  beliefs  would  show  associations with  later differ- 
ences  in  their  perceptions  of  school,  their  appreciation  of  conflicting 
emotions, and their moral sensibility. Of  particular interest was the ques- 
tion  of  whether the later correlates would  differ for these two aspects of 
evidence for both continui- 
early social understanding. The findings-the 
ties and differentiation in children’s psychological understandings-raise 
a 
number of  general developmental issues. 

The first is the significance of early emotion understanding for a range of 
developmental outcomes. We  have  discussed elsewhere the  evidence for 
continuity between  early  emotion understanding and  the  appreciation of 
conflicting emotions in  middle childhood and moral sensibility (Brown & 
Dunn,  submitted; Dunn  et  al.,  in  press).  The  findings  here  add  to  that 
picture with the evidence that these differences among young 3-year-olds 
in emotion understanding also relate to the children’s accounts of  positive 
peer  experiences in  kindergarten, three years later. These results support 
and  extend  those  of  other  research  showing  links  between  children’s 
emotion  understanding  and  peer  popularity  within  the  preschool  period 

198 

DUNN 

(Denham, McKinley,  Couchoud,  & Holt,  1990); they  remind  us  of  the 
central importance of  understanding others’ feelings for  a wide range of 
social behaviour. 

The second developmental point is that the pattern of  later correlates of 
the  individual differences in  children’s false belief explanation  task  per- 
formance showed some interesting differences from the later correlates of 
emotion  understanding.  The  children  who  as  40-month-olds  had  been 
successful at  explaining others’ behaviour  in  terms of  their beliefs  were 
more likely in the kindergarten interview to describe some difficulties with 
their teachers, their school activities, and their peers than the children who 
had done less well on the false belief tasks. They were also more likely to 
take  account  of  teacher  criticism,  and  judge  their  own  products  more 
harshly,  in  the  puppet  procedures.  It  is  important  to  note  that  these 
children  were  not  having  major  difficulty  in  adjustment  to  school. 
Rather, they were more likely to describe the reactions of  others towards 
them at school in guarded or slightly negative terms, and to mention their 
own difficulties or inadequacies. Note, too, that in the teacher criticism task 
the puppet teacher did not react in a strongly emotional way to the failure 
to produce “correct”  work. Instead, it was a negative judgement  that was 
implied. The results can be tentatively viewed, then, as indicating that the 
children  who  were  successful  at  the  false  belief  tasks  may  have  been 
particularly sensitive to  how  others are thinking about them  and judging 
them at school. More generally the findings suggest that early understand- 
ing of other minds does not guarantee an easier life at school; instead, these 
children may be particularly sensitive to, and aware of others’ judgements 
and  suffer accordingly. 

The differences in the patterns of sequelae found here further highlight 
the points made in the studies by Lalonde and Chandler and by Astington 
and Jenkins (this issue): that we do indeed need to differentiate the various 
aspects of social understanding shown by  2- and 3-year-olds. The findings 
also  raise  a  host  of  further  questions.  First,  how  may  the  continuities 
between  the  early  false belief  measures and  the  children’s  later  percep- 
tions be explained? For instance, do these correlations reflect continuities 
in characteristics of  the children themselves, or could contributions to the 
patterns over time be made by  certain kinds of  social experiences that are 
set in motion by  the children’s early skills at understanding other minds? 
Secondly, the particular false belief task measure that was employed was 
one  which  centred  on  children’s  ability  to  provide  explanations  of 
another’s  behaviour  in  terms  of  beliefs.  Would  we  find  different  later 
correlates  for  assessments  that  focus  on  children’s  ability  to  predict 
another’s  behaviour?  Are  there,  indeed,  individual  differences  in  how 
children  “solve” problems that  involve thinking about the representation 
of  mental  states? That  is,  are  some  children  “theorists”  in  the  terms of 

CHILDREN AS  PSYCHOLOGISTS 

199 

Astington  and  Gopnik  (1991),  and  others  “simulators”  (Harris,  1992)? 
More  generally  the  question  of  what  other  differences  characterise  chil- 
dren  who differ in  their ability to solve tasks that  involve thinking  about 
another’s thoughts deserves our attention40 they differ in the quality of 
their close relationships, for instance? 

In relation to the explanations the children gave in the false belief task, a 
further comment  is needed.  Most  children  who  provided  explanations  in 
terms of false belief did so in response to prompts, rather than unprompted. 
Children of 40 months are evidently only just beginning to understand the 
relations of false belief  to action: however,  in the context of the conversa- 
tion with observer and with the stimulus of the prompt question, they were 
able to generate appropriate, and original (rather than  imitative) explana- 
tions. There is a parallel here with the evidence from Scholnick and Wing’s 
(1992) study of the development of  children’s powers of logical inference, 
that  young  children’s  logical  capacities  in  conversation  are  considerably 
greater than those reported in test situations. There are, of course, notorious 
problems  in  making  inferences  about children’s capabilities  from  natural 
discourse with another; as Scholnick and Wing note, it  is evident that  the 
children in their studies could not have made such deductions on their own 
without  the  supportive  framework provided  by  conversation  with  a more 
mature person. However, Scholnick and Wing’s Vygotskyan argument that 
“the  origin  of  logic  is collaborative”  may well be echoed in our findings 
here.  The children in  our  study were taking the  first steps towards under- 
standing false  belief,  and  with  the  support  of  the  questions  and  prompts 
provided  by  the  adult,  some  of  them  were  able  to  generate  appropriate 
explanations of  the  puppet’s actions  in  terms  of  false belief.  Rather than 
dismissing these  ‘first steps”  as uninformative and insufficient evidence of 
independent  capacity,  we  view  them  as  important  early  indicators  of 
growing understanding.  The correlations over time  support such a view. 

Finally, two notes of caution are warranted. The first is that although the 
differences in patterns of correlates for understanding  emotions and other 
minds  are  intriguing,  they  are  based  on  one  relatively  small  sample  and 
clearly  need  replication.  The  second  caution  is  more  interesting concep- 
tually.  It is that measuring children’s performance  in these tasks does not 
tell us how  children  actually marshal  and use their understanding  in real- 
life  close  relationships.  Indeed,  other  findings  from  this  project  strongly 
underline  the point that the same child may show very different powers of 
understanding-in-action  in  different close relationships, depending on the 
emotional context of  the relationship and the pragmatics  of  the particular 
interaction. Evidence for this comes  from  observations of  the children  in 
interaction  with  their  mothers,  their  siblings  and  friends,  and  from  con- 
sideration of a number of different aspects of their interaction, such as their 

200 

DUNN 

engagement  in  joint  pretend  play,  their  management  of  conflict,  their 
discussion of  mental states. 

For example, there was not a significant correlation between children’s 
participation  in  joint  role  play  (which  reflects  an  ability  to  share  an 
imaginary world  with  another)  with  their mothers,  siblings, and  friends. 
Some children engaged in frequent joint role play  with  their siblings but 
not  their mothers, and  vice  versa (Youngblade & Dunn, in  press),  Simi- 
larly, there were not significant correlations between children’s propensity 
to take account of their antagonist’s feelings or needs when in conflict with 
their  mothers,  siblings  or  friends  (Slomkowski  &  Dunn,  1992).  Some 
children  used  conciliatory  strategies  and  took  account  of  their  mothers’ 
feelings when arguing with them, but failed to show such “other-oriented’’ 
strategies with  their  siblings-instead 
they  simply insisted on  their  own 
position. Others used “other-oriented’’ strategies when in dispute with their 
siblings  but  rarely  did  so  with  their  mothers.  Finally,  there  were  not 
significant correlations  between  the  frequency  with  which  they  engaged 
in mental state talk or causal talk with these different partners (Brown & 
Dunn, submitted; Dunn & Brown, 1993). Such findings suggest that it may 
be  misleading to  conceptualise children’s understanding of  others’  inner 
states solely as “within-child”  characteristics. Rather, the children’s under- 
standing  of  their  partner’s  inner  states-or  at  least  their  use  of  such 
understanding-is  crucially related to the emotional context of  the inter- 
action. This evidence provides yet another example of how important it is 
to  frame  our  developmental  questions  in  terms  of  both  cognitive  and 
emotional considerations.
