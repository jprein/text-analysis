Although key differences have been found in boys’ and girls’ proso-
cial behavior toward peers, few studies have systematically exam-
ined gender differences in how intrinsic perspective-taking
abilities—theory of mind (ToM) and emotion understanding
(EU)—and the extrinsic peer environment relate to prosocial
behavior. In this prospective longitudinal study, we studied gender
differences in the relations between children’s observed prosocial
behavior and their ToM, EU, and social preference ratings in 114
children (58 boys and 56 girls). We used conventional ToM and
EU tasks at 5 and 7 years of age. Observed prosocial behavior in tri-
adic peer interactions was assessed at both time points. Controlling
for gender, age, verbal ability, and earlier prosocial behavior, ToM
at 5 years was found to predict prosocial behavior at 7 years.
Results also revealed gender-differentiated associations at 7 years,
whereby only girls’ prosocial behavior was positively associated
with EU. Results are discussed in terms of gender-differentiated
patterns of socialization.

Introduction

A consistent feature of children’s successful peer interactions is prosocial behavior, conceptualized
as a voluntary act done with the speciﬁc intention to beneﬁt another (Eisenberg, 1986). Although
prosocial behavior appears early in life, it nonetheless undergoes considerable change during child-
hood; it becomes more sophisticated and increasingly nuanced according to gender as boys’ and girls’
peer interactions take somewhat distinctive pathways (Eisenberg, Fabes, & Spinrad, 2006; Rose &
Rudolph, 2006). Early manifestations of prosocial behavior have been consistently associated with
children’s perspective-taking skills in the context of both empathy development and, more recently,
early appearing understanding of others’ intentional attitudes, sometimes termed implicit theory of
mind (Eisenberg et al., 2006; Low & Perner, 2012; Moore, 2007; Vaish, Carpenter, & Tomasello,
2009). In both cases, children typically show their sensitivity to others’ emotional predicaments or
states of mind through their prosocial acts, often tailoring their action to others’ distress or intention,
even prior to 2 years of age (Svetlova, Nichols, & Brownell, 2010; Warneken & Tomasello, 2007). How-
ever, although it is well known that children’s understanding of mind and emotion undergoes pro-
found transformation during the transition to the school period (Harris, de Rosnay, & Pons, 2016;
Wellman, 2002), very little is known about how these unfolding perspective-taking abilities continue
to inﬂuence prosocial behavior development and whether gender socialization increasingly affects the
way children use their understanding of mind and emotion in prosocial interactions.

Also of importance to children’s early appearing prosocial behavior is the socializing environment;
prosocial behavior is socially motivated, driven and reinforced by afﬁliative interactions with others
(Grusec, 2006; Simpson & Willer, 2008), which again may be observed in children younger than 2
years of age. On entry to school, however, for many children there is a profound shift in their social
context, being thrust into the busy to and fro of peer interactions and increasingly complex social net-
works. Although much is known about the importance of children’s social relations for their school
success and social adaptation, relatively few studies have examined how the peer environment inﬂu-
ences prosocial behavior and whether this plays out differently for boys and girls.

In the current study, therefore, we examined whether known correlates of children’s prosocial
behavior—understanding of mind and emotion and social preference—exert gender-differentiated
effects on prosocial behavior development over the ﬁrst few years of school. We adopted a longitudi-
nal design ideally suited to quantifying changing patterns of prosocial behavior, which was the focus
of the investigation, rather than the origins of prosocial behavior per se. Despite the fact that children
enter school with a good repertoire of prosocial behaviors, we nonetheless expected that observing
children’s spontaneous peer interactions during this period, which is a time of rapidly growing under-
standing of mind and emotion and expanding social relationships, would provide important insight
into how prosocial behavior comes to be increasingly gender differentiated.

Gender differences in prosocial behavior

As children mature, peer relations become increasingly gender segregated and the interactions that
boys and girls have with their same-sex peers become more differentiated (Maccoby, 1998; Rose &
Rudolph, 2006). By middle childhood, boys predominantly socialize in larger peer groups that are
more agentic-focused and competitive, whereas girls typically interact in dyadic peer relationships
that are more interpersonal by nature (Geary, Byrd-Craven, Hoard, Vigil, & Numtee, 2003; Maccoby,
2002). Indeed, gender differences in prosocial behavior may be present in children as young as 3 years
(Sebanc, 2003), but these differences become increasingly pronounced as children enter middle child-
hood and remain intact through to adolescence (Maccoby, 1990). Increasing age-related gender seg-
regation is thought to be inﬂuenced by multiple biological, environmental and cultural factors,
including hormonal changes and maturation, emerging differences in the structure and style of play,
the development of gender identity, and an increasing awareness of gender stereotypes and socially
prescribed gender roles (Eagly, 1987; Maccoby, 1998). Cumulatively, these factors are thought to con-
tribute to the increasingly ingrained gender differences in peer interactions as children spend more

15

time in the school environment. Thus, although differences in boys’ and girls’ peer interactions may
begin to emerge on school entry, the literature suggests that they become especially pronounced dur-
ing middle childhood (Golombok, Rust, Zervoulis, Golding, & Hines, 2012; Gray & Feldman, 1997).

In relation to prosocial behavior speciﬁcally, previous studies have typically found that girls tend to
act more prosocially toward their peers than do boys when rated by peers and teachers (Crick &
Grotpeter, 1995; Ladd & Proﬁlet, 1996) and in observational studies (Leaper, 1991; Strough & Berg,
2000). This disparity is conﬁrmed in girls’ personal accounts of their friendships; girls more often
report that they are the recipients of prosocial acts than do boys (Sandstrom & Cillessen, 2003;
Storch, Nock, Masia-Warner, & Barlas, 2003). Against this backdrop, it is important to consider
whether those factors shown to be associated with prosocial behavior exert an inﬂuence on prosocial
behavior development differently for boys and girls.

Links between perspective taking and children’s social behavior

During early to middle childhood, children form and reﬁne their ability to predict and explain
behavior based on their understanding and interpretation of other people’s mental attitudes (Flavell
& Miller, 1998; Wellman, 2002). This ability has been largely investigated in two domains: theory
of mind (ToM), the understanding of others’ mental states such as beliefs and desires, and emotion
understanding (EU), the ability to predict and explain emotion in terms of causes, consequences,
and contextual determinants (Harris, 2000). Although ToM and EU are conceptually interrelated, they
appear to be subtlety yet critically distinctive. ToM reﬂects an ability to represent and understand the
beliefs and desires of others, which enables children to take on the perspectives of others and accord-
ingly attune their behavior (Wu & Su, 2014). EU, while often drawing on ToM insights, captures chil-
dren’s capacity to judge or infer an emotional outcome based on multiple determinants and becomes
particularly elaborated during middle childhood when children’s adaptive social functioning—that is,
the ability to interpret and respond to emotional cues in a socially appropriate way—is critical to their
successful peer interactions (Denham, 2007).

On balance, existing research indicates that there is a positive association between prosocial
behavior and both ToM and EU (see Eisenberg et al., 2006, for an overview), although it should be
noted that some studies have failed to document an association (Hughes, White, Sharpen, & Dunn,
2000; Ruffman, Slade, Devitt, & Crowe, 2006). The somewhat inconsistent nature of these ﬁndings sug-
gests that such relations are not incontrovertible and may be inﬂuenced by child-level characteristics
such as gender. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the nature of the relation between prosocial behav-
ior and ToM is the same as the relation between prosocial behavior and EU (see de Rosnay, Harris, &
Pons, 2008, for a review). In addition, positive associations between ToM and prosocial behavior have
not consistently been shown to be independent of children’s linguistic ability (de Rosnay et al., 2008;
Slaughter, Imuta, Peterson, & Henry, 2015). Therefore, it is important to continue to examine the inde-
pendent inﬂuences of ToM and EU on prosocial behavior.

Although previous literature on ToM and EU generally demonstrates boys and girls to be compa-
rable in these two domains (Charman, Ruffman, & Clements, 2002; Pons, Lawson, Harris, & de
Rosnay, 2003), there is preliminary evidence to suggest that gender may play a moderating role in
the relation between these perspective-taking skills and prosocial behavior. Research examining
ToM, EU, and various social outcomes indicates a stronger association for girls compared with boys.
For example, a study by Badenes, Clemente Estevan, and García Bacete (2000) found that only girls’
peer acceptance was associated with performance on a ToM deception task as they entered middle
childhood. Furthermore, in a sample of 9- to 12-year olds, Custrini and Feldman (1989) found that
the ability to encode and decode others’ emotions was related to social competence in girls but not
in boys. Finally, a study by Banerjee, Rieffe, Meerum Terwogt, Gerlein, and Voutsina (2006) showed
that peer acceptance for 8- to 11-year-old girls, but not boys, was associated with their emotional
state references in a task tapping understanding of negative emotions. The extent to which these latter
ﬁndings can be generalized to prosocial behavior is unclear because prosocial behavior is a distinct
construct that emphasizes a different facet of children’s social interactions compared with peer accep-
tance or social competence (Eisenberg et al., 2006), but it remains noteworthy that gender exerts a
moderating inﬂuence on the association between EU and social outcomes. To date, no study has

16

speciﬁcally investigated the role of gender in the relation between ToM and EU with prosocial behav-
ior during middle childhood; thus, the current study aimed to address this gap in the literature.

Social preference and prosocial behavior

In addition to intrinsic perspective-taking abilities, prosocial behavior has also been shown to be
inﬂuenced by extrinsic social factors (Eisenberg et al., 2006). Existing research suggests that peer rat-
ings of classmates’ likeability, or their social preference (see Coie, Dodge, & Coppotelli, 1982), can have
a reinforcing effect on the extent to which one may act prosocially (Gifford-Smith & Brownell, 2003).
Alternatively, this association may occur through a self-fulﬁlling cycle whereby children who sponta-
neously display more prosocial behavior elicit more positive peer feedback and enjoy higher levels of
peer acceptance, which in turn encourages more prosocial behavior and so on (Eisenberg et al., 2006;
Laible, McGinley, Carlo, Augustine, & Murphy, 2014). Indeed, recent longitudinal research has sup-
ported this latter scenario, demonstrating a positive bidirectional association between popularity
and a proclivity to act more prosocially toward peers (Caputi, Lecce, Pagnin, & Banerjee, 2012;
Kornbluh & Neal, 2016). Thus, children’s social preference appears to play a critical role in their proso-
cial behavior.

As to whether there may be gender differences in the association between prosocial behavior and
social preference, given established gender differences showing that girls to rely on reciprocal inter-
personal relations to a greater extent than do boys (Rose & Rudolph, 2006), it seems plausible that
the prosocial behavior of girls may be more inﬂuenced by their social preference ratings than that
of boys. Indeed, a number of studies have shown that the positive association between popularity
and prosocial behavior during middle childhood is stronger for girls than for boys (Banerjee et al.,
2006; Kornbluh & Neal, 2016; Lansford et al., 2006).

The current study

This study focused on children’s prosocial behavior toward peers during the ﬁrst few years of
school, a time of rapidly increasing gender segregation. Speciﬁcally, we sought to examine how chil-
dren’s understanding of mind and emotion (ToM and EU) and important aspects of peer experience
(social preference) inﬂuence prosocial behavior development in relation to gender. Using a prospec-
tive longitudinal design, we examined how the associations between key variables may change or
develop as children mature from 5 years to 7 years of age and included age-appropriate measures
of both ToM and EU at each time point. We also examined social preference at both time points,
derived from nominations of the peers who children most and least liked to play with, which provided
an index of children’s peer-rated social standing among their classmates. We used an observational
measure of prosocial behavior in a triadic free-play session, as opposed to a trait-based measure of
prosociality, to examine children’s proclivity to act prosocially speciﬁcally in the context of peer inter-
actions. Finally, we included a measure of children’s verbal ability because verbal ability is a well-
known ToM correlate (see Milligan, Astington, & Dack, 2007, for a relevant meta-analysis) and plays
an indispensable role in social interactions.

Based on previous ﬁndings, it was hypothesized that better ToM and EU would be associated with
higher levels of prosocial behavior and that social preference would have independent positive asso-
ciations with prosocial behavior toward peers at both 5 and 7 years of age. With respect to gender dif-
ferences, we predicted that girls would display more prosocial behavior than boys at both time points.
We also tentatively hypothesized that prosocial behavior would be more robustly associated with
ToM, EU, and social preference in girls compared with boys based on previous work examining gender
differences in ToM and EU with various social outcomes (Badenes et al., 2000; Banerjee et al., 2006;
Custrini & Feldman, 1989) and in sociometric status (Banerjee et al., 2006; Kornbluh & Neal, 2016;
Lansford et al., 2006). From a longitudinal perspective, we predicted that this gender differentiation
in how our key variables relate to prosocial behavior would be more pronounced at 7 years compared
with 5 years, in line with established accentuations of gender differences as children get older and
once they have been in the school environment for a longer period (Maccoby, 1998; Rose &
Rudolph, 2006).

Method

Participants

A total of 114 kindergarten children (58 boys and 56 girls) were recruited from three inner subur-
ban schools in Sydney, Australia. Children came from a mixture of ethnic backgrounds common to the
area, and all had English as a native language. None experienced serious economic disadvantage. Opt-
out recruitment was against local ethical guidelines, so only children whose parents gave written con-
sent in kindergarten participated in the current study. Mean age at Time 1 was 5.61 years (SD = 0.42).
Children were tested again 24 months later when they were in Year 2. At Time 2, 18 children were
unavailable owing to mobility; thus, the Time 2 sample comprised 96 children (49 boys and 47 girls).
Mean age at Time 2 was 7.73 years (SD = 0.38). Testing at both time points took place during the sec-
ond half of the school year when familiarity with the classroom peer group was well established.

Procedure

Children were interviewed individually in a quiet room at school for their assessments of verbal
ability, ToM, and EU. Task and trial orders were varied, and children were randomly assigned to
one of two orders. In the ﬁnal testing session at both time points, prosocial behavior was observed
during a free-play session with groups of 3 children at a time.

Measures

Verbal ability

Children’s verbal ability was assessed using the Test of Early Language Development (TELD-3;
Hresko, Reid, & Hammill, 1999), which measured expressive and receptive semantic skills. Raw
(unstandardized) scores were used in statistical analyses to permit independent analysis of chronolog-
ical age effects.

Time 1 ToM

Six false-belief understanding tasks were administered: (a) two unexpected contents tasks based
on Perner, Leekam, and Wimmer (1987), (b) two unexpected transfer tasks based on Wimmer and
Perner (1983), and (c) two nice/nasty surprise tasks based on Hughes and colleagues (2000). Tasks
were narrated as storybook vignettes accompanied by colored drawings. For tasks (a) and (b), children
were asked a reality control question (e.g., ‘‘What is really inside the box?”) in addition to a target
false-belief question (e.g., ‘‘What does Lily think is inside the box?”). Both the control question and
the test question needed to be answered correctly for children to be awarded 1 point. The nice/nasty
surprise tasks required children to attribute a feeling to the story protagonist based on the match
between his or her desires (e.g., the protagonist likes Coke) and his or her expectation (e.g., the pro-
tagonist [mistakenly] thinks he or she will get Coke). Children needed to correctly answer the control
question and the target question and to attribute an appropriate feeling to the protagonist to be
awarded 1 point. All tasks are widely used (Milligan et al., 2007; Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001)
and have good reliability and internal consistency (e.g., Hughes et al., 2000). A total false belief score
summed the six false-belief items and had sound internal consistency, with Cronbach’s a = .78.

Time 2 ToM

Six vignettes assessing children’s faux pas understanding were individually narrated to children
based on those developed by Baron-Cohen, O’Riordan, Stone, Jones, and Plaisted (1999). Each vignette
detailed an example of a faux pas being committed such as unintentionally spoiling a surprise party.
After each vignette, children were presented with six questions to assess whether they had detected
and identiﬁed the speciﬁc faux pas (‘‘Did anyone say something they shouldn’t have said or maybe
something a bit awkward?”), their identiﬁcation of the scenario (‘‘What did they say that they should
not have said?” and ‘‘Why shouldn’t they have said it?”), their comprehension of the scenario (‘‘In the

18

story, who was the surprise party for?”), whether the perpetrator was ignorant when committing the
faux pas (‘‘Did Nicky remember the party was a surprise?”), and how the target of the faux pas would
feel (‘‘How do you think Helen felt? Why do you think she felt that way?”). For each vignette, children
needed to answer all six questions correctly in order to pass. A total faux pas score was summed from
the six vignettes. Internal consistency was low (a = .63). However, this value is not unexpected given
the low item number for this task (Clark & Watson, 1995) and reﬂects the diversity of the construct
being assessed (Crutzen & Peters, 2015).

Time 1 EU

Based on Pons, Harris, and de Rosnay (2004), three age-appropriate components of emotion under-
standing were chosen from the Test of Emotion Comprehension (TEC) to assess the emotional con-
structs of (a) two items assessing emotion based on diverse desires (e.g., attribution of distinct and
appropriate emotions to two characters—one who likes lettuce and one who dislikes lettuce—when
they receive lettuce), (b) four items assessing emotion based on ignorance (e.g., attribution of emotion
to a rabbit eating a carrot without knowing a fox is hiding nearby), and (c) four items assessing under-
standing hidden emotion (e.g., attribution of emotion to a character who is smiling in order to conceal
his or her distress while being teased). Two items assessing false-belief-based emotion were also
included (Hughes et al., 2000). All components involved short vignettes about pictured protagonists,
and test questions required choosing from four pictured facial expressions. All components assessed
equal numbers of positive and negative emotion scenarios. Initial analysis showed that one of the
ignorance-based emotion stories failed to correlate with any other task, so it was omitted from anal-
yses. Thus, children received a possible score between 0 and 11. Internal consistency for the total was
low (a = .60) but not unexpected considering the diversity of this construct (see Pons & Harris, 2005).

Time 2 EU

An assessment of children’s understanding of mixed emotions was individually administered and
comprised eight mixed-emotion vignettes (Brown & Dunn, 1996; Kochanska, 1991; Meerum Terwogt,
Koops, Oosterhoff, & Olthof, 1986; Nunner-Winkler, 2007; Thompson & Hoffman, 1980). In each vign-
ette, a scenario was described that would cause the protagonist to feel multiple emotions; for exam-
ple, the protagonist helps her friend read a book during reading time but consequently runs out of
time to read her own book, causing her to feel both happy (that she helped her friend) and sad (that
she could not read her own book). After each vignette was read aloud, children were asked how the
protagonist would feel and why. Children passed only if they correctly identiﬁed two divergent emo-
tions for each vignette and gave a coherent justiﬁcation that was distinct and appropriate for each
emotion (children were given no score if they reported feeling two separate emotions for the same
reason). A total score out of 8 was summed across vignettes. Internal consistency across the eight
items was good (a = .72).

Social preference

At both time points, social preference was assessed using Coie and colleagues’ (1982) peer nomi-
nation sociometric interview technique. Children were asked to nominate three classmates who they
‘‘like to play with the most” and three classmates they ‘‘do not like to play with,” using photographs of
their peers as prompts. Each child’s individual ‘‘like most” and ‘‘like least” scores were standardized
within classrooms in order to account for different-sized peer groups. Social preference was calculated
by subtracting classroom-standardized ‘‘like least” from standardized ‘‘like most” nominations.

Prosocial behavior

Children’s prosocial behavior was assessed during a free-play session with two other same-sex
classmates. Triads were selected based on children’s social preference nominations at each time point,
such that children were grouped together with two other peers who were not nominated as their best
friends. Thus, the triads comprised different combinations of peers for each child at 5 years and at 7
years of age. Each triad was ﬁlmed unobtrusively for 7 minutes with no adults present. At 5 years chil-
dren played with a large toy zoo, and at 7 years they played with a large toy castle. Using Ensor and
Hughes’ (2010) methods, ﬁve prosocial acts were coded for the triad free-play sessions at both time

R.-L. Kuhnert et al. / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 154 (2017) 13–27

19

points: sharing, helping, comforting, praising, and encouraging. These prosocial acts were coded
accordingly: focal child offering an object previously in his or her possession to peer (into peer’s hand
or lap) or intentionally adding an object to an array within which peer was situated (sharing); focal
child providing physical/verbal assistance to peer (helping); focal child expressing concern for peer
or offering physical/verbal reassurance to peer (comforting); focal child praising congratulating, or
complimenting peer (praising); focal child responding to peer’s emotion or request in a positive
way that encouraged or supported peer’s emotion or request (encouraging). Each behavior could arise
spontaneously or in response to a peer’s request. Displays of each prosocial act were recorded as fre-
quencies regardless of how short or long the displays lasted. A total prosocial behavior score was
summed across the ﬁve acts, reﬂecting an overall tendency to assist and share with same-sex peers
during free play. Total scores ranged from 0 to 8 at 5 years and from 0 to 15 at 7 years. Coding of
the free-play sessions was conducted separately by two of the study’s authors, both of whom had been
trained on video coding in a previous study. An independent rater (a doctoral student who had also
been trained on video coding) coded 20% of the total triad free-play sessions at both time points,
and inter-rater reliability was substantial across all ﬁve categories, with Cohen’s j = .73.

variable.

Separate correlations were run for boys and girls in order to systematically examine potential gen-
der differences (Table 2). First, it is noteworthy that there was little evidence that Time 1 prosocial
behavior predicted children’s ToM, EU, or social preference. However, for girls, ToM and EU showed
distinctive associations with Time 2 prosocial behavior; longitudinally T1 ToM, but not EU, was pos-
itively correlated with T2 prosocial behavior, whereas concurrently T2 EU, but not ToM, was positively
correlated with T2 prosocial behavior. The differentiated inﬂuence of ToM and EU on prosocial behav-
ior was evident in girls despite the robust correlation between these two variables, indicating that
their independent assessment was justiﬁed. In addition, for girls there was a positive association

Associations with prosocial behavior at Time 1 and Time 2

Two planned hierarchical regression models were constructed to evaluate the proposed patterns of
association among prosocial behavior, ToM, EU, and social preference at both 5 and 7 years of age (see
Tables 3 and 4). We also controlled for possible confounding effects of age and verbal ability. Interac-

tion terms between gender and variables of interest were calculated based on gender differences iden-
tiﬁed in Tables 1 and 2 in order to further explore these speciﬁc ﬁndings. Regression analyses with all
gender interaction variables included were also conducted, and the overall pattern of ﬁndings for both
T1 and T2 prosocial behavior remained unchanged. Thus, the ﬁnal models included only interaction
variables where gender differences were identiﬁed in preliminary analyses.

In the ﬁrst model predicting T1 prosocial behavior (Table 3), gender, age, and verbal ability were
entered on the ﬁrst step; T1 ToM, EU, and social preference were entered on the second step; and a
separate gender interaction variable with T1 ToM was entered on the ﬁnal step. The overall model
was signiﬁcant; however, none of the variables in the model was found to be a signiﬁcant independent
predictor of T1 prosocial behavior.

In the second model predicting T2 prosocial behavior (Table 4), gender, age, verbal ability, and T1
prosocial behavior were entered on the ﬁrst step; T1 and T2 ToM, EU, and social preference were
entered on the second step; and three separate gender interaction variables with T1 ToM, T2 EU,
and T2 social preference, respectively, were entered on the ﬁnal step. The model was signiﬁcant at
the second and ﬁnal steps, and both of these steps signiﬁcantly improved model ﬁt. In the ﬁnal step,
T1 ToM signiﬁcantly predicted T2 prosocial behavior, b = .31, t(72) = 2.11, p = .039, indicating that chil-
dren’s ToM at 5 years of age had a positive longitudinal inﬂuence on their prosocial behavior at 7 years

irrespective of gender. Unexpectedly, verbal ability was found to negatively predict T2 prosocial
behavior, b =  .33, t(72) =  2.65, p = .010.

The ﬁnal step also revealed that the interaction between gender and Time 2 EU was signiﬁcant,
b = .38, t(72) = 2.67, p = .009 (see Fig. 1). Subsequent simple slopes analysis of this interaction showed
that for girls there was a signiﬁcant positive association between EU and prosocial behavior, b = .25, t
(72) = 2.22, p = .029, whereas for boys this association was not signiﬁcant, b =  .15, t(72) =  1.43,
p = .16.

Discussion

The current study used a prospective longitudinal design to investigate gender-differentiated asso-
ciations among prosocial behavior, ToM, EU, and social preference, and how these associations may
change from 5 years to 7 years of age. Children’s ToM at 5 years signiﬁcantly and independently pre-
dicted prosocial behavior toward peers at 7 years, even after controlling for potentially confounding
variables such as age, verbal ability, and earlier prosocial behavior. This ﬁnding demonstrates a longi-
tudinal, but not concurrent, association between ToM and prosocial behavior that was not moderated
by gender. In addition, at 7 years, prosocial behavior was positively associated with EU for girls but not
for boys. Taken together, these ﬁndings show that by middle childhood, boys and girls draw on dis-
tinct factors when interacting with their same-sex peers.

Theory of mind and prosocial behavior

Our ﬁndings add to the growing body of research demonstrating a positive association between
children’s ToM and their prosocial behavior (e.g., Cassidy, Werner, Rouke, Zubernis, & Balaraman,

R.-L. Kuhnert et al. / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 154 (2017) 13–27

23

2003; Slaughter, Dennis, & Pritchard, 2002; Wu & Su, 2014). Furthermore, our results provide support
for the theoretical assumption that underpins the majority of research on ToM—that children’s intrin-
sic capacity to understand the thoughts, beliefs, and desires of others may facilitate their tangible real-
life behavior in social interactions. Importantly, skills like ToM are not merely theoretical attributes
that exist in a vacuum; rather, they may be critically inﬂuential in the practical manifestation of chil-
dren’s social behavior in everyday life. The current study demonstrated a longitudinal, but not concur-
rent, association between ToM and prosocial behavior. This supports the ﬁndings of Caputi and
colleagues (2012), who similarly found longitudinal effects of ToM on prosocial behavior from 5 years
to 6 years, and from 6 years to 7 years, but did not ﬁnd any concurrent relationships within time
points. Indeed, longitudinal associations have been reported in various studies that examined other
real-life social outcomes in relation to ToM such as friendship insight (Dunn, Cutting, & Fisher,
2002), mental-state talk in conversations with friends (Hughes & Dunn, 1998; Hughes, Ensor, &
Marks, 2011), and sensitivity to criticism (Cutting & Dunn, 2002; Lecce, Caputi, & Pagnin, 2013). Thus,
the ﬁndings of the current study, in conjunction with previous research, highlight that the consolida-
tion of social cognitive skills is a developmental process that requires time, experience, and matura-
tion in order for these skills to be maximized in practical social behavior (Hughes, 2011).

Gender-differentiated associations with EU

Based on previous studies that have examined gender differences in the associations among ToM,
EU, and various social outcomes (Badenes et al., 2000; Banerjee et al., 2006; Custrini & Feldman, 1989),
it was hypothesized that both ToM and EU would be more robustly associated with prosocial behavior
for girls compared with boys, and that this association would be more prominent at 7 years of age
compared with 5 years once children had spent more time in the school environment. This hypothesis
was partially supported by our ﬁndings, which demonstrated that girls’ EU was positively associated
with their prosocial behavior at 7 years, with no such relation for boys. As such, a main effect of gender
at 7 years was qualiﬁed by the signiﬁcant difference in how boys’ and girls’ EU related to their proso-
cial behavior time point. Indeed, other studies that have examined prosocial behavior in relation to
other key variables similarly failed to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant independent association with gender once
the contributions of other variables were taken into account (e.g., Caputi et al., 2012; Eggum et al.,
2011; Ensor & Hughes, 2005).

It appears that by middle childhood, girls may use their EU abilities during practical prosocial acts
toward peers in a way that boys do not. This distinction may reﬂect a greater proclivity for girls, com-
pared with boys, to capitalize on their understanding of others’ emotions in their peer interactions.
Based on the established gender-differentiated nature of children’s peer relations, whereby girls’ rela-
tionships are more interpersonal by nature and have a stronger focus on emotional transactions (Rose
& Rudolph, 2006), it seems likely that there may be a greater actual or perceived need for girls to be
able to understand how their peers are feeling and to harness this knowledge to act prosocially and,
thus, maintain their interpersonal emotional bonds. From an evolutionary viewpoint, the need for
females to interact with and rely on more distally related kin and non-kin members, compared with
males, may have contributed to ‘‘a unique suite of selection pressures for females to be more sensitive
to the display and reception of higher levels of interpersonal investment behaviors” (Vigil, 2007, p.
146). Indeed, research on children’s emotional displays indicates that girls are more attuned to the
emotional experiences of their peers (Banerjee et al., 2006; Custrini & Feldman, 1989) and are more
likely to conceal their negative emotions for the sake of others in a social situation (Cole, 1986;
Saarni, 1984) compared with boys.

In addition, it appears that ToM and EU have distinctive relations with prosocial behavior moder-
ated by gender. Our results indicate that earlier ToM understanding is important for boys and girls
alike, whereas EU appears to be more inﬂuential in the prosocial behavior of girls than in that of boys.
This supports the account that EU may reﬂect a more interpersonally oriented perspective-taking abil-
ity that is sensitive to gender differences in social relations, whereas ToM may be a relatively more
gender-neutral ability (Braza et al., 2009). Intriguingly, the current study also found differences in
how ToM and EU related to prosocial behavior from 5 years to 7 years of age; ToM showed longitudi-
nal, but not concurrent, associations with prosocial behavior, whereas EU showed concurrent, but not

24

longitudinal, relations. One possible account of this distinction is that ToM and EU may differ in their
scope; whereas ToM is more narrowly focused on the acquisition of cognitive milestones or conceptual
insights that are critical to children’s perspective taking, EU incorporates a broader range of psycho-
logical phenomena, whereby a prerequisite of interpreting a wide range of idiosyncratic emotional
reactions and responding sensitively to others’ emotional cues is grounded in ToM abilities
(Hoffman, 1982). Consequently, children’s EU abilities at 7 years may have drawn on their earlier
ToM skills at 5 years, in addition to their concurrent skills concerning the interpretation of and
response to emotional cues, reﬂected in a concurrent, but not longitudinal, association between EU
and prosocial behavior at 7 years. Alternatively, it may be the case that earlier ToM skills, but not
EU skills, confer a later advantage to children’s peer interactions because of a mediated effect on a
third variable, which then in turn increases children’s later prosocial behavior. Although we did not
explicitly investigate any mediational relations in the current study, our longitudinal ﬁndings indicate
that future research on ToM and prosocial behavior would beneﬁt by examining potential mediational
effects of different child and situational factors.

The current study had an unexpected ﬁnding at 7 years of age, whereby children’s verbal ability
was found to negatively predict prosocial behavior. Although this appears to contradict existing
research (e.g., Cassidy, Werner, Rourke, Zubernis, & Balaraman, 2003; Slaughter et al., 2002), it should
be noted that there is signiﬁcant variation in how children’s linguistic skills relate to their prosocial
behavior, depending on the measures used to assess these two constructs (Eisenberg et al., 2006). Per-
haps the children in the current study who were more verbally proﬁcient used their linguistic skills to
act prosocially toward their peers, which was not captured by our measure of prosocial behavior.
Including a verbal-based measure of prosocial behavior may be a fruitful area for future research.

Contrary to the study hypothesis, social preference was not associated with prosocial behavior at
either time point. This ﬁnding suggests that during middle childhood intrinsic factors such as ToM and
EU may play a relatively greater role in inﬂuencing prosocial behavior compared with extrinsic factors
such as social preference.

Limitations and future directions

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of the current study and the ensuing potential direc-
tions for future research. First, although observational measures of prosocial behavior have been found
to be less gender biased than report-based measures (Rose & Rudolph, 2006; Zarbatany, Hartmann,
Gelfand, & Vinciguerra, 1985), it is possible that our conceptualization of prosocial behavior may have
nonetheless implicitly favored girls. There was an observed trend in the triadic play sessions for girls
to engage in more logistical interactions concerning rule making and boundary setting for the play
compared with boys, which in turn may have given rise to greater numbers of the types of prosocial
acts coded in the current study. It would be interesting to examine whether girls still display more
prosocial behavior when it is measured as a ratio of time spent engaging in interactions that require
children to help and share, rather than an absolute number of acts, or whether this gender difference is
merely reﬂective of the distinct types of interactions in which boys and girls engage.

Second, due to the relatively modest sample size, we were unable to analyze any effects relating to
each individual component of our prosocial behavior composite (sharing, helping, comforting, praising
and encouraging). It would be worth exploring whether speciﬁc types of prosocial acts have unique
relations with ToM and EU and whether they show differential associations for boys and girls. It is
likely, given that certain prosocial acts rely more heavily on perspective-taking abilities such as com-
forting (Eisenberg et al., 2006), that psychological understanding may inﬂuence speciﬁc prosocial acts
to a greater extent than others. Similarly, it may be that girls are more inclined to display certain types
of prosocial behaviors compared with boys but that boys may in turn display other types of prosocial
behaviors more than girls. Thus, gender differences in prosocial behavior may be more complex than
simply observing any overall difference in the number of total prosocial behaviors, as an amalgam, and
may instead manifest in differences within and between speciﬁc prosocial acts.

Finally, prosocial behavior in the current study was measured in interactions with same-sex peers
so as to reﬂect the predominance of gender-segregated peer interactions that typify middle childhood.
However, it is possible that this may have overinﬂated any gender differences in prosocial behavior

R.-L. Kuhnert et al. / Journal of Experimental Child Psychology 154 (2017) 13–27

25

given that boys and girls have been found to engage in signiﬁcantly more gender-stereotyped activi-
ties when interacting with same-sex peers compared with mixed-sex peers (Fabes, Martin, & Hanish,
2003). Furthermore, it is difﬁcult to determine whether the gender effect found in the current study
was driven by child gender or by peers’ gender—namely, the gender of the recipients of children’s
prosocial behavior. It may be that boys and girls are generally treated differently regardless of who
is instigating the prosocial behavior toward them. Indeed, research indicates that boys and girls show
differences in the ways they behave toward same-sex versus other-sex peers; boys tend to afﬁliate
more than girls with familiar same-sex peers (Benenson, Quinn, & Stella, 2012), and girls show greater
variability in the amount of time spent engaged in play with peers of the opposite sex (Martin & Fabes,
2001). Future research comparing boys’ and girls’ interactions with same-sex versus other-sex peers,
as well as using naturalistic observations of children’s interactions in settings such as the school play-
ground, may be beneﬁcial in clarifying these issues concerning peer gender.

Conclusion

The current research is the ﬁrst longitudinal study to systematically examine gender differences in
the relations among observed prosocial behavior with ToM, EU, and social preference during middle
childhood. The results indicated that earlier ToM at 5 years of age positively predicted later prosocial
behavior for all children irrespective of gender. By contrast, the relation between EU and prosocial
behavior at 7 years was moderated by gender, such that there was a positive association between
EU and prosocial behavior for girls only. Thus, it appears that ToM and EU have unique gender-
differentiated associations with children’s prosocial behavior toward peers during middle childhood.
