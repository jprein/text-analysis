Abstract 

This study investigated the longitudinal relations between theory of mind (ToM) understanding, 
self-perceptions,  and  perceptions  of  gender-role  orientation  in  28  school-aged  children,  (16 
girls, 12 boys, aged 8-12 years). Theory of mind and perceptions of self were assessed at Time 
1 (T1, M = 8 y 5 m) and two years later at Time 2 (T2, M = 10 y 4 m). Negative correlation was 
found  between  T1  ToM  and  T2  Perceptions  of  Moral  Self    (r  =  -.55,  p  =  .004).  Positive 
correlations were found between T1 Perceived Masculinity and T1 ToM (r = .682, p = .015). No 
relations were found between ToM T1 and T2 (r = .281, ns), as well as between T1 and T2 Self-
Understanding scores (r = .244, ns). Positive relations were found between self--understanding 
and ToM at T1 only (r = .394, p = .038).  Implications for children’s socioemotional development 
are discussed.

Introduction 

Evidence  over  the  past  decade  suggests  understanding  of  mind  may  grow  from  a 
foundation  of  understanding  of  emotions  and  self  (Bartsch  &  Wellman,  1995),  and 
develops  in  part  through  social  relationships  and  attachment  relations  (Dunn,  2008; 
Hughes, 2011; Meins et al., 2002). Few studies, however, have examined such a link 
past  middle  childhood  (Meins  et  al.,  2006;  Watson  et  al.,  1999),  and  thus,  there  is  a 
need to understand how the child’s mind and emotion connect (Dunn, 2008). Given the 
important role that interactions play in children’s later success in understanding other’s 
mind  and  behaviour  (Amsterlaw  et  al.,  2009;  de  Rosnay  &  Hughes,  2006),  there

remains  a  lack  of  research  on  how  social  experiences  foster  the  growth  of  children’s 
understanding mind and self including gendered aspects of one’s identity. 

Although  Theory  of  Mind  (ToM)  development  or  the  ability  to  understand  thoughts 
and  emotions  in  self  and  other  is  an  active  area  of  research  (Dunn,  2008),  empirical 
evidence gleaned from the later childhood and early adolescent years remains sparse 
(Hughes, 2011). In addition, there remains a dearth of longitudinal studies that explore 
whether  or  not  reasoning  about  self    (intrapersonal)  and  other  (interpersonal)  are 
reciprocal  and  interdependent,  or  remain  isolated  and  independent  from  one  another 
(Lucariello,  2005).    To  address  this  gap  in  the  research,  the  purpose  of  the  present 
study is to explore connections over time between children’s theory of mind (ToM), or 
the ability to understand thoughts and emotions in self and other and their perceptions 
of self-worth and gender-role orientation. Our main research question is: Do links exist 
over time (2 years), between children’s ToM understanding and their perceptions of self 
and gender-role orientation? 

Children’s Understanding of Mind and Emotion 

The development of the ability to represent and reason from second-order beliefs (two 
or more mental states) has received relatively little attention in the literature particularly 
during the transition from middle  to  late childhood  (e.g.,  8  –  12  years) (Carpendale  & 
Chandler,  1996;  Carpendale  &  Lewis,  2004).    This  is  surprising,  given  that  social 
communication  depends  mainly  on  what  people  believe  about  other  people's  beliefs 
and emotions (Astington, 1993).  Past research shows that second-order or interpretive 
reasoning  may  influence  children's  ability  to  understand  speech  acts  such  as  lies, 
jokes, sarcasm, and irony (Filoppova & Astington, 2008, 2010; Leekam, 1993), and in 
their  ability  to  understand  self-representational  display  rules  (Banerjee  &  Yuill,  1999; 
Banerjee & Watling, 2007).  Given that advanced or higher order social reasoning may 
also  help  adolescents  understand  the  ambiguous  nature  of  personal  and  social 
silences (Bosacki, 2008), some researchers suggest such advanced reasoning is also 
fundamental 
(e.g, 
embarrassed, proud, etc.), their sense of self and other persons, and social interactions 
(Hughes, 2011). 

to  adolescents’  understanding  of  social  moral  emotions 

to  understand  complex  or  socio-moral  emotions 

Recent  evidence  suggests  that  ToM  understanding  continues  to  develop  during 
middle  childhood  to  late  childhood  (approximately  during  the  ages  8-12  years), 
particularly regarding the understanding of complex and ambiguous emotions (Pons, et 
al. 2003, 2004; Yuill & Coutlas, 2007).  In contrast to the simple or basic emotions (e.g., 
happy,  sad), 
(e.g.,  pride, 
embarrassment), children must hold in mind two separate pieces of information: other 
people's and societal norms (Saarni, 1999).  That is, children must imagine what others 
think  of  their  behaviour  and  self-evaluate  their  behaviour  against  internalized 
behavioural standards.  Although complex emotion understanding hinges on cognitive 
abilities such as second-order ToM reasoning and perceptions of self including gender-
role orientation, to date, no studies have investigated the links among these concepts 
during  middle  to  late  childhood.  Given  this  gap  in  the  literature,  this  study  will 
investigate  individual  differences  in  social  cognition  within  the  school  context  during 
middle childhood. 

ToM and Self-Perceptions in School Context  

Although ToM and self-perceptions are foundational to child's educational experiences 
(Bruner,  2006), 
relations  between  ToM 
understanding,  self-perceptions,  and  school  experiences  beyond  the  age  of  8  or  9 
either  within  their  family  or  school  context    (Bosacki,  2003;  Hughes,  2011).  Similar  to 
the  rich  family  context,  the  school  classroom  provides  children  with  a  valuable

opportunity to learn social and emotional messages regarding interactions and others’ 
mental  states.    Regarding  academic  competence  and  school  success,  associations 
have  been  found  between  ToM,  emotion  understanding  and  the  production  of  stories 
and general language ability (Astington & Jenkins, 1995; Denham et al., 2013). Theory 
of  mind  understanding  has  also  been  claimed  to  facilitate  children's  ability  to  self-
monitor and regulate their cognitive process and engage in reflexive thinking (Fiasee, & 
Nader-Grosbois, 2012; Lagattuta & Wellman, 2002). 

that  psychological  understanding 

Although  research  shows  that  knowledge  about  self  and  others’  thoughts  and 
emotions  continues  to  develop  during  middle  to  late  childhood  (Hughes,  2011),  we 
know  little  about  older  children’s  ToM  understanding  and  self-perceptions.    Research 
studies  suggest 
to  higher-order, 
metacognitive  thought  or  more  advanced  reasoning  (Pine  &  Siegler,  2003).    That  is, 
children  who  possess  high  levels  of  ToM  understanding  or  provide  psychological 
explanations are more likely to "think about their own and others thinking" and engage 
in  critical  philosophical  enquiry  and  shared  dialogue  during  the  school  day  (Haynes, 
2002). Thus, given that teaching and learning is crucial to self- and ToM understanding 
(Bruner,  1996),  this  study  explores  how  children’s  ToM  understanding  plays  a  role  in 
their perceptions of self within the middle school years  (Ladd, Buhs, & Troop, 2002).  
Also,  as  Hughes  (2011)  states,  a  relatively  small  number  of  studies  have  examined 
individual  differences  in  social  understanding  in  relation  to  children’s  own  views  of 
themselves within the context of their middle school experiences.

Children’s Perceptions of Self and Gender-Roles 

Another aspect of social cognitive development is also the ability to understand oneself 
as  a  concept  that  continues  to  develop  during  childhood  and  into  adulthood  (Harter, 
1999).  Past  research shows  that  during  childhood, the focus  on  one’s gender  identity 
during  development  affects  children’s  perceptions  of  their  physical  appearance  and 
body-image  (Golombok  &  Hines,  2002).  Previous  findings  show  that  children’s 
perceptions  of  physical  appearance  and  how  they  conform  to  societal  stereotypes  of 
gender-role orientations (e.g., societal stereotypical feminine and masculine behaviour) 
often serves as a source of self-worth (Aina & Cameron, 2011; Compion et al., 2004; 
Harter,  1999).  Such  societal  messages  may  in  part  be  transmitted  and  reinforced  by 
various  social  agents  including  family,  peers,  and  the  mass  media  (e.g.,  Costarelli  et 
al.,  2011;  Smolak,  Levine,  &  Schermer,  1999).    Past  studies  suggest  that  parental 
comments  and  modeling  regarding  gender-role  stereotypes  may  influence  children’s 
self-perceptions  and  attitudes  concerning  physical  appearance  (Maccoby,  1998).  
However,  given  the  possible  influence  of  peers  and  teachers  on  children’s  self-
perceptions and gender-role identity (McHale et  al., 1999; Sandberg et al. 2006), it is 
surprising  that  few  studies  investigate  children’s  understanding  of  self,  gender-roles, 
and ToM in childhood within the school context.  

forming  self-judgments  (Fine,  2011;  Maccoby,  1998),  and 

In  addition,  given  the  notion  that  young  females  and  males  may  use  a  different 
“metric”  when 
that 
perceptions  of  others’  social  and  emotional  worlds  may  be  viewed  differently  for 
females  and  males  (Bussey  &  Bandura,  1999;  Fine,  2011),  this  study  explored  links 
among  children’s  ToM  understanding  and  understanding  of  self  and  gender-role 
orientation. Given that social-cultural experiences and self-conceptions are inseparable 
(Bronfenbrenner, 2005), the present study explored how might children’s perceptions of 
self  and  gender-role  relate  to  one’s  ToM  ability  during  middle  childhood.  More 
specifically,  the  present  study  addressed  the  following  questions:  1)  Do  longitudinal 
relations exist among children’s ToM understanding, self-perceptions, and gender-role 
orientation at Time 1 and 2 years later at Time 2; and 2) Do individual differences exist

in  children’s  scores  and  correlational  patterns  among  variables  at  both  time  points  (8 
years and 10 years of age)? 

Method 

Participants 

As part of a larger longitudinal study of children’s ToM understanding and its relation to 
social  cognitive  and  emotional  competencies  (Bosacki,  2008),  this  small-scale, 
longitudinal,  correlational  study  focused  on  two  time  points  (T1,  2006  and  T2,  2008) 
involving  28  mainly  Euro-Canadian  children 
from  middle  SES,  semi-rural 
neighbourhoods (12 boys, 16 girls, M = 10y, 4m).   

Procedures 

Upon  obtaining  ethical  clearance  from  the  universities,  school  board,  principals, 
teachers, parents, and students, each year children completed standardized pencil and 
paper measures and participated in individual interviews that involved social stories to 
assess  children’s  ToM  understanding  (e.g.,  how  did  they  interpret  mental  states  in 
others),  and  their  perceptions  of  self  (physical  appearance,  behavioural  or  moral 
conduct,  and  global  self-worth)  and  gender-role  orientation  (perceived  femininity  and 
masculinity). Only those children who received written parental permission and agreed 
verbally participated in the study. 

Data  collection  each  year  (T1  and  T2)  consisted  of  two  stages;  the  first  stage 
consisted  of  a  group,  in-class  session  where  three  trained  female  researchers  group 
administered  a  pencil-and-paper  self-report  questionnaire  regarding  self-perceptions 
and gender-role orientation to the children.  To facilitate task completion, researchers 
provided explicit written (on the blackboard) and verbal task instructions to the children.  
Following  this  group  instruction  session,  one researcher read  aloud  the questionnaire 
items  to  the  participants  and  the  children  completed  the  task  together  item  by  item.  
The  two  remaining  researchers  monitored  the  class  session  and  addressed  any 
questions  that  children  had  as  they  completed  the  task.    This  task  was  completed 
within a 30 minute class period.   

The  second  stage 

involved  an 

two  story-interviews 

individual  session 
to  explore  TOM 

in  which  children  were 
administered 
(order  of  stories  was 
counterbalanced), followed by a series of questions to assess their self- understanding.  
Interviews were conducted in a small room outside of the classroom and all interviews 
were  audiotaped  and  transcribed.    The  interview  session  was  approximately  20-30 
minutes in length.  Demographic information pertaining to family structure was obtained 
through parent questionnaire. Children also participated in a semi-structured interview 
regarding  self-understanding  that  focused  continuity,  distinctiveness,  and  agency 
(Damon  &  Hart,  1988).  All  tasks  were  administered  by  three  trained  female 
researchers,  and  children  were  reminded 
their  responses  would  remain 
confidential,  and  that  they  had  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions  or  stop  at  any  time 
during the research.   

that 

This study focuses on tasks conducted during each of two time points (T1 = 2006/7, 
T2 = 2008/9), the ToM story and self-understanding interviews (February-April T1, T2) 
and the self-report questionnaire to assess self-perceptions and gender-role orientation 
(November – April, T1, T2).  As noted above, the self-concept questionnaire (SPSSC, 
Harter,  1985)  was  group  administered  within  class,  whereas  the  ToM  story  and  self-
understanding interviews were conducted within a quiet room outside of the classroom 
during  school  time.  Interviews  were  audiotaped  for  subsequent  transcription  and 
analysis.

Measures 

Children’s ToM, Self, and Gender-Role / Bosacki 

 

Theory of Mind Understanding (Social Ambiguous Stories)  (Bosacki, 2000; Bosacki & 
Astington,  1999).    Gleaned  from  past  research,  to  assess  ToM  understanding  or 
understanding  other’s  mental  states  and  emotions),  adapted  versions  of  two  brief 
vignettes  consisting  of  an  ambiguous  social  situation)  that  describe  an  ambiguous 
social  event  with  three  children  (one  story  involves  three  females,  one  story  involves 
three  male)  were  read  to  the  child  (Bosacki,  2008).  Borrowing  from  theoretical  work 
that views ToM as a vehicle or instrument that is used to co-construct or narrate ones’ 
social reality (Astington, 1993; Bruner, 2006), and studies that investigate an advanced 
ToM  through  the  use  of  narratives  (Artar,  2007;  Charman  &  Shumeli-Goetx,  2008; 
Fiasse  &  Nader-Grosbois,  2012;  Happe,  1994),  this  task  aimed  to  asses  the  ToM 
involved in interpreting social meaning from ambiguous stories.  

The  stories  were  socially  ambiguous  because  past  research  has  found  children’s 
interpretations  of  ambiguous  social  situations  to  be  an  effective  method  of  eliciting 
children’s representational understanding of mind and emotion (Dodge & Frame, 1982; 
Levinson, 1995). Thus, this task was developed to strike a balance between projective, 
open-ended narrative tasks (e.g., Fox, 1991; Selman, 1980), and more forced-choice, 
experimental  tasks  (e.g.,  see  Baron-Cohen,  2011).    The  two  stories  involved  one 
scenario for girls (an unfamiliar girl approaches two friends already engaged; two boys 
on a sports team need to choose another boy for their team).  However, no reason was 
given  in  this  story  to  explain  why  the  actors  did  not  speak  to  the  recipient.  Thus, 
participants  had  to  infer  the  reason  that  the  actors  disregarded  the  recipient.  The 
following  stories  are  excerpts  from  the  Nancy  Margie  and  Kenny/Mark  Social 
Ambiguous  Story  Interviews  used  to  assess  participants’  understanding  of  emotions 
and mental states (Bosacki, 2000). 

Nancy/Margie 

Nancy and Margie are watching the children in the playground.  Without saying a word, 
Nancy nudges Margie and looks across the playground at the new girl swinging on the 
swing set.  Then Nancy looks back at Margie and smiles.  Margie nods, and the two of 
them start off toward the girl at the swingset.  The new girl sees the strange girl walk 
towards her.  She'd seen them nudging and smiling at each other.  Although they are in 
her class, she has never spoken to them before.  The new girl wonders what they could 
want. 

Kenny/Mark 

Kenny  and  Mark  are  co-captains  of  the  soccer  team.    They  have  one  person  left  to 
choose for the team.  Without saying a word, Mark winks at Kenny and looks at Tom 
who is one of the last children left to be chosen.  Mark looks back at Kenny and smiles.  
Kenny nods and chooses Tom to be on their team.  Tom sees Mark and Kenny winking 
and smiling at each other.  Tom, who is usually one of the last to be picked for team 
sports, wonders why Kenny wants him to be on his team. 

The  stories  were  followed  by  questions  that  assessed  emotion  understanding 
including emotion word labelling and understanding of situational causes of emotions.  
In  addition,  following  each  narrative,  the  children  were  asked  to  imagine  and  predict 
what the characters would do next, what they be thinking and feeling, and whether or 
not  the  actions  would  be  considered  the  ‘right’  or  ‘wrong’  thing  or  moral  judgements.  
They were also asked to imagine what would happen next in the story.  Based on past 
research  (Bosacki,  2000),  responses  to  each  emotion  were  coded  according  to  their 
accurateness  (mental  state  and  emotional  labelling),  and  their  level  of  conceptual 
sophistication  (understanding  of  the  socially  ambiguous  situation,  or  what  causes

emotions  for  both  self  and  peer).  For  example,  a  code  of  0  was  provided  for 
intangential  or  “I  don’t  know  responses,”1  =  behavioral/physical  responses  such  as 
“Tom  would  walk  away  and  play  elselwhere.”,  2  =  Psychological  that  would  include 
references to at least 1-2 psychological or emotional state such as “Tom thought that 
Kenny and Mark were unfair.”  3 = Integrated psychological response which would be a 
sophisticated  response  involving  a  complex  (3  or  more),  and/or  contradictory 
combination  of  psychological  emotional  terms  (e.g.,  “Tom  felt  that  Kenny  and  Mark 
were  angry  with  him  and  wanted  to  trick  him  into  thinking  they  were  his  friends.”). 
Responses  were  also  coded  for  emotional  valence  including  positive,  negative,  and 
neutral scenarios. 

Cronbach's alpha for the 21-item aggregate score for the Nancy/Margie/new girl and 
Kenny/Mark/Tom  story  was  .67  and  69  respectively.  To  obtain  as  sensitive  a  ToM 
measure  as  possible,  children’s  scores  on 
the  Nancy?Margie/new  girl  and 
Kenny/Mark/Tom  (0-21)  were  summed  into  a  reliable  composite  (0–42).    For  the 
present  sample,  Cronbach’s  alpha  for  the  sum  of  these  two  scores  was  α  =  .69.  
Consistent  with  past  research  (Bosacki),  this  was  deemed  to  indicate  modest,  but 
adequate,  internal  consistency  to  use  the  combined  total  score  as  our  main  index  of 
Time  1  ToM  understanding  (M  =  23.34;  SD  =  4.56,  range  0-42).  Randomly  selected 
25%  of  the  transcripts  were  coded  by  a  second  independent  coder,  resulting  in  an 
average  kappa  of  (.92)  across  the  two  stories.  Discrepancies  were  discussed  until 
consensus was achieved. 

Self-concept.  To assess children’s perceptions of their competencies, three subscales 
from Harter's (1985) Self-Perception Profile for Children (SPPC) were used.  Based on 
past  literature  (Cassidy,  1999;  Harter,  1999),  the  present  study  focused  on  three 
aspects  that  some  researchers  consider  particularly  relevant  to  children  including:  
perceived behavioral conduct (6 items, e.g., “how well-behaved do you think you are,” 
Cronbach’s alpha = .81), physical appearance (6 items, e.g., “how good-looking do you 
think  you  are,”  Cronbach’s  alpha  =  .79),  and  global  self-worth  (6  items,  e,g.,  “how 
happy are you being who you are?”  Cronbach’s alpha = .89). Randomly selected 25% 
of the transcripts were coded by a second independent coder, resulting in an average 
kappa of (.90) across the two coders.  Discrepancies were discussed until consensus 
was achieved. 

Self-understanding.  To  assess  the  complexity  of  the  self-system,  in  addition  to 
assessing  the  evaluative  or  objective  component  of  self  as  measured  by  the  SPPC, 
children  were  also  asked  questions  to  assess  the  subjective  self.    Adapted  from 
questions from past research, these questions addressed topics of continuity, agency, 
and distinctiveness.  (Damon & Hart, 1988).  Randomly selected 25% of the transcripts 
were  coded  by  a  second  independent  coder,  resulting  in  an  average  kappa  of  (.88) 
across the two coders. Discrepancies were discussed until consensus was achieved. 

Gender-Role  Perceptions.  To  assess  children's  self-perceived  gender  roles,  children 
were  administered  a  self-report  questionnaire  that  contained  items  gleaned  from  two 
standard  measures  used 
in  research  on  children’s  gender  role  perception. 
Stereotypical  masculine,  feminine  and  neutral  items  concerning  characteristics  and 
activities were gleaned from the Children's Sex Role Inventory (CSRI, Boldizar, 1991), 
and  a  recent  study  on  gender  roles  in  middle  childhood  (McHale  et  al.,  1999).  The 
present  study  focused  on  the  masculinity  items  (6  items,  e.g.,  “I  am  good  at  sports.” 
Cronbach’s alpha = .70) and the femininity items (6 items, e.g., “I like babies and small 
children a lot.” Cronbach’s alpha = .72).  This scale was presented orally to the children 
and  after  each  item  they  were  asked  to  respond  to  a  Likert-type  scale  of  pictures 
indicating how true it was for them.

Children’s ToM, Self, and Gender-Role / Bosacki 

 

Descriptive Statistics and Preliminary Analysis 

Data  analysis  based  on  a  coding  scheme  developed  from  previous  research  was 
derived  from  the  ToM  interview  questions  to  create  a  composite  ToM  understanding 
score  (Bosacki,  2000).    Thus,  higher  ToM  scores  represented  a  more  sophisticated 
understanding of emotion and mental state concepts. Likewise, a coding scheme was 
derived  from  the  self-understanding  questions  to  create  a  total  composite  subjective 
self-understanding score as mentioned above. Accordingly, higher scores represented 
higher  perception  of  self-understanding.  High  ToM,  Self-Perceptions,  Self-
Understanding, and Gender-Role Orientation scores represented a more sophisticated 
understanding  of  both  mental  states  in  others  and  one's  own  self-theory  including 
perceived femininity and masculinity.

Longitudinal Individual Differences  

Examination  of  the  means  of  the  main  variables  (T1,  T2:  ToM,  SPCC,  Gender-Role 
Orientations)  showed  significant  effects  for  time  for  ToM,  Self-Understanding  and 
Perceived  Masculinity  (see  Table  1).    Paired  T-tests  showed  significant  increases 
between  Time  1  and  Time  2  ToM  Total  scores,  Self-Understanding  Scores  and 
Perceived Masculinity. In contrast, Self-Perception scores did not increase significantly 
from T1 and T2. 

Cross-sectional and Longitudinal Correlational analysis 

Correlational analysis was conducted between aggregate ToM scores, self-perceptions 
and  understanding  and  gender-role  orientation  variables  cross-sectionally  at  T1  and 
T2, as well as longitudinally between T1 and T2 scores. 

Table  2  shows  cross-sectional  correlations, 

for  ToM,  self-perceptions  and 
understanding, and gender-role orientation correlations at T1 and T2. Results showed 
significant positive correlations between T1 ToM scores and T1 perceived Masculinity 
(r(27) = .68, p = .015), but not at Time 2.  Self-Understanding and ToM were related at 
T1  only  (r(27)  =  .39,  p  =  .038).  A  negative  correlation  was  found  between  self-
understanding and perceived physical self-concept at T1 only (r(27) = -.39, p = .039). 

Regarding longitudinal relations between T1 and T2, children’s T1 Total ToM scores 
and their perceptions of self at T2 showed significant negative correlations between T1 
Total ToM scores and T2 children’s perceptions of behavioral conduct or a moral sense 
of self: r(24) = -.55, p = .004; and perceptions of global self-worth: r(22) = -43, p < .05). 
These  results  support  previous  research  that  found  negative  relations  between  ToM 
and  self-perceptions  (Bosacki,  2000).  Regarding  connections  between  Time  1  and 
Time 2 ToM and self-concept scores, no correlations were found between Time 1 and 
Time  2  ToM  scores  (r(26)  =  .28,  p  =  ns).  Similarly,  no  relations  were  found  between 
children’s  T1  and  T2  self-perceptions  were  found,  nor  T1  and  T2  self-understanding 
total scores. 

Regarding longitudinal relations between T1 and T2  among perceptions of gender-
role  self,  ToM,  a  marginally  significant  negative  correlation  was  found  between 
perceptions  of  global  self  worth  at  Time  1  and  self-understanding  at  Time  2    (r(27)  -

.413 p =.056). This result suggests that children who were happy with who they were 
and  had  a  positive  view  of  self-worth  reported  less  self-understanding  at  10  years  of 
age.  Alternatively,  children  at  8  years  who  reported  a  negative  feeling  of  self-worth 
were more likely to report a great sense of self-understanding at 10 years of age. 

Regarding 

longitudinal  relations  between  self-understanding  and  gender-role 
perceptions, a significant relation was found between perceived masculinity at T1 and 
self-understanding  at  T2  (r(22)  =  .502,  p  =.017,  whereas  a  marginally  significant 
positive  correlation  was  found  between  perceived  T1 femininity  T2  self-understanding 
(r(22)    =  .384,  p  =.08.    The  positive  relation  between  perceived  masculinity  and  self-
understanding two years later suggests that children who were more likely to perceive 
themselves  as  stereotypically  masculine  or  relating 
to  stereotypic  masculine 
characteristics (e.g., I am good at sports) were more likely to report a greater sense of 
self-understanding  two  years  later  at  10  years  of  age.  No  correlations  were  found 
between self-understanding at Time 1 or 2 and Gender-Role at T2. 

In sum, associations between children’s ToM understanding and their perception of 
self  and  gender-role  orientation  across  time  holds  many  educational  and  clinical 
implications that will be discussed in the next section.  

Discussion 

This  small-scale  longitudinal  study  examined  the  links  between  children’s  ToM 
understanding,  perceptions  of  self  and  gender-role  orientation  at  8  years  of  age,  and 
then 2 years later at 10 years of age. One of the main strengths of this study is that it 
follows  a  research  design  of  a  relatively  small-scale,  longitudinal  study  that  combines 
both  qualitative  and  quantitative  analyses  (Creswell,  2012).  Given  that  the  present 
findings  expand  children’s  perspectives  regarding  ToM,  self-perceptions  and  gender-
role  orientation,  this  study  offers  a  unique  contribution  to  the  existing  literature 
regarding ToM in later childhood. Accordingly, the main findings are discussed in terms 
of the following research questions 1) Do longitudinal relations exist among  children’s 
ToM understanding and their perceptions of self and gender-role orientation at 8 years 
of  age  and  two  years  later  at  10  years  of  age,  and  2)  Do  individual  differences  in 
children’s  scores  and  correlational  patterns  among  variables  exist?    Findings  will  be 
then be discussed in terms of the extant literature on ToM, self-concept, and gender-
role orientation. 

Regarding the first research question, examination of the means showed significant 
age effects for ToM understanding, self-understanding, and perceived masculinity. That 
is  the  older  the  children,  the  higher  the  ToM  understanding,  self-understanding,  and 
perceived masculinity scores. From a psychocultural and social cognitive perspective, 
(e.g., Bussey & Bandura, 2004; Bronfenbrenner, 2005; Maccoby, 1998), such findings 
can  be  explained  in  terms  of  the  interplay  among  self-understanding,  stereotypic 
societal gender-role expectations and their link to Theory of Mind. Given past research 
that  suggests  children  develop  their  ToM  and  self-concept  through  an  interaction  of 
cognitive  development  and  social  interactions  (de  Rosnay  et  al.,  2006),  perhaps  the 
increase  in  scores  over  the  two  years  is  partly  due  to  an  interaction  of  individual  and 
environmental factors. That is, the increase in ToM and self-perceptions may be due in 
part to the combination of increased cognitive ability to think about the self-concept in a 
more  coherent  sense  including  a  more  comprehensive  gender  identity.  In  addition, 
increased  social  exposure  to  others,  particularly  one’s  peer  group  and  conversations 
regarding others’ mental states may help to develop one self’s concept.  

Guided  by  the  second  research  question  that  asked:  “Do  individual  differences  in 
children’s  scores  and  correlational  patterns  among  variables  exist?,”  for  both  Time  1 
and  2,  self-understanding  was  unrelated  to  perceived  self-competence  regarding

behavioral  conduct,  physical  appearance,  and  global  self-worth.  The  one  exception 
was a significant negative relation between T1 self-understanding and T1 physical self-
concept,  suggesting  that  for  8-year-olds  only,  the  higher  children  scored  on  self-
understanding  or  understood 
terms  of  continuity,  agency  and 
distinctiveness,  they  more  likely  they  were  to  report  negative  comments  about  their 
physical  sense  of  self.  Alternatively,  the  lower  children  scored  on  self-understanding, 
the  more  positive  they  rated  their  physical  appearance.  That  is,  participants  who 
experienced difficulty in understanding themselves as psychological beings, in a more 
conceptual,  cognitively  complex  way  were  also  more  likely  to  evaluate  their  physical 
appearance in a positive way. 

themselves 

in 

Such  findings  support  claims  that  the  self-concept  is  a  multidimensional  and 
dynamic  process  that  continues  to  develop  with  age,  and  may  contain  either  inter-
related  or  independent  dimensions  (e.g.,  Bruner,  1996;  Gergen,  2001).  Furthermore, 
such findings support past developmental research that suggests that younger children 
tend  to  focus  more  on  the  physical  aspect  of  the  self  and  as  they  age,  they  begin  to 
include  further  psychological  aspects  of  their  self-concept  (Harter,  1999).  As  many 
researchers  claim  (Bussey  &  Bandura,  2004;  Harter  1999;  Harre,  1986),  we  need  to 
learn what kind of role self-mechanisms such as self-regulatory functions play in ToM 
understanding  and  how  this  may  differ  according  to  gender,  ethnicity,  socioeconomic 
status,  etc.  Future  research  needs  to  explore  the  possible  influences  on,  and 
connections  between  children’s  developing  ability  to  judge  or  evaluate  themselves  as 
well as understand themselves as conceptual beings. 

Regarding findings concerning ToM and perceptions of self and gender-role, how do 
we explain the finding that at 8 years of age only, children who scored higher  in ToM 
also  viewed  themselves  as  more  stereotypically  masculine?  Relatedly,  perceived 
masculinity at 8 years old was also correlated positively  with self-understanding at 10 
years.  Given  that  only  the  younger  children  showed  a  positive  link  between  ToM  and 
perceived  masculinity,  perhaps  at  8  years  of  age  children  who  are  more  likely  to 
understand mental states in self and others may also be more likely to understand the 
complexity  of  gender-stereotypic  characteristics  of  masculinity  such  as  “I  like  to  play 
sports.” that this kind of statement can be applied to both males and females. Given the 
development of the conceptual self, the positive relation between perceived masculinity 
at 8 years of age and self-understand at 10 years of age supports research that shows 
that  children’s  concept  of  self  may  expand  and  become  more  complex  and 
multidimensional in that one’s perception of gender-roles may also become integrated 
into one’s larger conceptual sense of self (Harter, 1999). Thus, perhaps at 8  years of 
age,  children  who  thought  of  themselves  in  more  stereotypical  masculine  ways  were 
also more likely to have a more coherent sense of conceptual self at 10 years. 

Regarding the connections between ToM and self-concept, we found two significant 
relations, one positive relation between ToM and self-understanding at 8 years and not 
at  10  years.  The  second  ToM  and  self  correlation  was  the  negative  relation  between 
ToM at T1 and a perceptions of behavioural conduct or a moral sense of self – that is, 
how  well  children  perceived  themselves  to  be  well  behaved  according  to  social 
conventions. Both findings will be discussed in turn. 

We first need to explain why children who scored high on ToM also scored high on 
self-understanding  at  8  years  old  but  not  10  years  of  age.  Given  that  a  sense  of  self 
and  other’s  mental  states  may  develop  through  initial  child-caregiver  interactions 
(attachment  theory  perspective,  see  Meins  et  al.,  2002),  perhaps  children’s  sense  of 
self  and  other  are  more  connected  in  younger  childhood  and  becomes  more 
differentiated.  That  is,  from  an  attachment-theory  perspective,  the  internal  working 
model (IWM) of the self and other becomes more multidimensional and complex as it 

 

222

may  grow  and  expand  with  new  relationships  beyond  the  initial  caregiver-child 
relationship. 

We  also  need  to  explain  the  negative  correlation  between  ToM  at  T1  and 
perceptions of behavioural conduct or a moral sense of self at T2. Perhaps this finding 
could be explained that if children were more likely to understand mental states of self 
and other at 8 years old they were also less likely to see themselves as ‘following the 
rules’ or social conventions at school when they are 10 years old. Perhaps having the 
ability to see other peoples’ perspectives at 8 years helps to develop the ability to see 
various  ways  that  ‘rules’  are  created  by  society  and  as  children  grow  older,  they  are 
more likely to question the rules, or find other ways to follow the rules – or learn about 
how  rules  are  created  based  on  others’  perspectives  within  society.  Alternatively, 
children  who  scored  low  on  ToM  at  8  years  may  have  been  less  likely  to  understand 
the perspectives of others which in turn may have led them to perceive themselves as 
more  well-behaved  and  likely  to  follow  social  conventions  at  10  years  old.  As  both 
explanations are complex and researchers need to continue to explore the longitudinal 
connections between ToM and moral development and behaviour (Lagattuta, Nucci, & 
Bosacki, 2010; Nucci, 2009). 

The  present  findings  regarding  the  links  between  ToM  and  self-perceptions  could 
also  be  explained  within  the  context  of  gendered  parent-child  and/or  teacher-child 
emotion talk (Meins et al., 2002). That is, perhaps the parents of the participants in the 
present  study  engaged  in  gender-differentiated  behaviours  and  mental  state  talk  with 
their daughters and sons. In addition to parents, Denham and colleagues (2013) assert 
teachers  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  shaping  their  children's  social  and  emotional 
competence.  Thus, teachers may play a crucial role in children’s developing ToM and 
perceptions of self as thus may act serve as emotion or psychosocial "coaches" in that 
they could promote the development of social cognitive competencies. 

The present findings support past research that suggests that children’s higher ToM 
abilities  may  lead  them  to  imagine  what  their  friends  think  about  them  either  in  a 
positive or negative way.  That is, the present findings support past studies that found 
some  children  with  a  sophisticated  ToM  ability  may  be  more  sensitive  to  teacher 
criticism  and  more  likely  to  interpret  hidden  social  messages  among  peers  including 
negative experiences  with peers (Caravita, Di Biasio, & Salmivalli, 2010; Dunn, 2008; 
Hughes, 2011).  Perhaps a more developed ToM ability may serve as a double-edged 
sword and may help some children to decipher ambiguous social messages which may 
include  both  positive  and  negative  messages.    Researchers  need  to  continue  to 
explore  how  children’s  ToM  and  perceptions  of  self  and  gender-role  may  have  an 
influence on their school adjustment and well being in school (Zambo & Brem, 2004). 

Implications 

The  results  of  this  study  may  help  to  remind  educators  and  researchers  of  the 
importance  of  children'  developing  ability  to  think  about  oneself  and  others  as 
psychological  beings.  Those  who  work  with  children  also  need  to  be  cognizant  that 
middle  to  late-childhood  is  a  time  when  females  and  males  develop  an  increasing 
awareness  of  increased  social  consciousness  and  social  pressures  to  conform  to 
gender-stereotypic  norms  (Fine,  2011;  Maccoby,  1999).  This  study  may  help  to 
increase researchers’ and educators' awareness of how gender-stereotypic beliefs may 
affect  children'  socioemotional  development.    Accordingly,  the  current  findings  may 
encourage youth workers to minimize the extent to which they use gender-stereotypic 
language  and  behaviour  around  gradeschool-aged  children.    Moreover,  adults  should 
be encouraged to emphasize emotion vocabulary and to articulate often how they are 
feeling  and  thinking.    As  noted  by  Kitayama  et  al.  (1995),  to  provide  a  "thicker"

description  of  children's  emotional  understanding,  researchers  need  to  examine  the 
"emotional  culture"  of  the  home  by  exploring  the  possible  influences  of  all  family 
members - mothers, fathers, siblings and extended family. 

Given the limitations of the present study (e.g., small-scale, longitudinal correlational 
study,  lack  of  general  intelligence  measure,  ethnically  homogeneous  sample), 
interpretations of the present findings are to be made with caution.  Given the complex 
process of the co-construction of ToM and perceptions of self and gender-roles, semi-
structured interviews with story narratives and self-report questionnaires may not have 
been able to capture a complete reflection of such a dynamic process. Moreover, given 
the  complex  process  of  self-socialization  (Maccoby,  1998),  future  research  needs  to 
investigate additional socialization agents who may influence the development of ToM 
and perceptions of self and gender-role, including peers, teachers, family members, as 
well  as  the  influence  of  media  experiences  with  text  (paper,  electronic),  Internet, 
television, film, etc. (Bosacki, 2008).  

In sum, findings from this study suggest that longitudinal associations exist between 
children’s ToM understanding, and how they think and feel about themselves and their 
gender-roles in the middle school grades Such findings support previous research (e.g, 
Cutting  &  Dunn,  1999’  Jenkins  &  Astington,  1996),  and  theorists’  claims  that  self-
perceptions  and  gender-role  perception  may  play  significant  roles  in  children'  ToM 
understanding (Hughes, 2011). Thus, this research makes two significant contributions 
to  the  current  discourse  on  the  nature  of  social  cognition  in  middle  childhood.  
Theoretically,  it  highlights  the  complex  connection  between  children’s  ToM  and 
perceptions  of  self  and  gender-role  orientation.  Practically,  beyond  contributing  to 
theories of social cognition, these results have practical significance in that changes in 
ToM  and  perceptions  of  self  and  gender-role  orientation  play  an  integral  part  in 
children’s everyday experience in the middle school setting.
