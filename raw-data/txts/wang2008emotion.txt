Abstract

Knowledge of emotion situations facilitates the interpretation, processing, and organiza-
tion of signiﬁcant personal event information and thus may be an important contributor to
the development of autobiographical memory. This longitudinal study tested the hypothesis
in a cross-cultural context. The participants were native Chinese children, Chinese children
from ﬁrst-generation Chinese immigrant families in the U.S., and European American chil-
dren. Children’s developing emotion knowledge and autobiographical memory were assessed
three times at home, when children were 3, 3.5, and 4.5 years of age. Children’s emotion
knowledge uniquely predicted their autobiographical memory ability across groups and time
points. Emotion knowledge further mediated culture eﬀects on autobiographical memory. The
ﬁndings provide important insight into early autobiographical memory development, and
extend current theoretical understandings of the emotion–memory interplay. They further
have implications for the phenomenon of infantile amnesia and cross-cultural diﬀerences in
childhood recollections.

1. Introduction

Autobiographical memory (AM) encompasses memory for personally signiﬁcant,
speciﬁc event episodes from an individual’s life (Nelson & Fivush, 2004). It is critical
for self-identity and psychological well-being. One important characteristic of auto-
biographical memory is that it is often accompanied by heightened emotional reac-
tions (McGaugh, 2003; Pillemer, 1998; Stein & Liwag, 1997). Emotion is generally
held to be important or even essential to autobiographical remembering, and
researchers have identiﬁed a host of mechanisms underlying the emotional eﬀects
(Christianson & Safer, 1996; McGaugh, 2003; Reisberg & Hertel, 2004). However,
little theoretical or empirical attention has been paid to the mnemonic function of
emotion knowledge (EK, or emotion situation knowledge), that is, the schematic
knowledge of situational antecedents of emotions (Denham, Zoller, & Couchoud,
1994; Stein & Liwag, 1997). Literature of three diﬀerent research areas, on the other
hand, has suggested a plausible link of such knowledge to autobiographical remem-
bering, which calls for further investigation.

1.1. Cognitive perspectives

From an information-processing point of view, EK provides a knowledge struc-
ture or mental schema based on which cognitive processes of appraisal, interpreta-
tion, or meaning analysis of an event situation can be carried out (Frijda, 1986;
Stein & Liwag, 1997). Such cognitive processes are deeply involved in the anticipa-
tion and actual experience of emotions within the situation, no matter whether they
initiate or simply mediate the emotional experience (Lazarus, 1982; Schachter &
Singer, 1962). As Frijda (1986) claims, ‘‘Emotional experience, ﬁrst of all, is experi-
ence of the situation” (p. 193). The resulting emotional activation, in turn, may trig-
ger special encoding and consolidation mechanisms that facilitate memory formation
(Christianson & Safer, 1996; McGaugh, 1995; McGaugh, 2003).

Furthermore, cognitive appraisal of the event situation enabled by EK may allow
the individual to fully appreciate the emotional meaning and, thus, personal signiﬁ-
cance, of the event, making the event more memorable (Conway & Pleydell-Pearce,
2000; Pillemer, Picariello, & Pruett, 1994). And just like other schemas or scripts (Neis-
ser, 1981; Schank, 1982), EK may provide an organizational structure to process and
represent signiﬁcant personal event information with co-assembled aﬀect scenes,
allowing the information to be well integrated into the autobiographical knowledge
base and be eﬀectively stored and retrieved (Conway & Bekerian, 1987; Tomkins,
1979). As a result, an autobiographical memory with event-speciﬁc details may be
formed. The memory may further integrate emotional-evaluative information (e.g.,
‘‘I was so happy!”) indicative of cognitive and emotional processing enabled by EK.

1.2. Developmental connections

The development of EK and AM appears to coincide chronologically in ontoge-
netic development, such that the age trend in children’s acquisition of EK parallels
the age trend in children’s development of AM. Speciﬁcally, from as young as age 2,
children can often associate appropriate eliciting situations with simple emotions,
and they show awareness of the causes of emotions experienced by themselves and
others (Bretherton & Beeghly, 1982; Harris, 1989; Lewis & Michalson, 1983). Cor-
respondingly, toddlers often exhibit an impressive ability to retain personal event
information over extended periods of time, especially with adults’ assistance (Harley
& Reese, 1999; Nelson & Fivush, 2004). However, EK at the early stage is still lim-
ited and general and children tend to distinguish emotion situations broadly as being
positive or negative (Brody & Harrison, 1987; Hesse & Cicchetti, 1982). Similarly,
when remembering past events, young children often focus on what adults would
consider to be generic or routine information. For example, when asked about a
recent camping trip, a 2.5-year-old child reported, ‘‘And then we waked up and
eat dinner. First we eat dinner, then go to bed, and then wake up and eat breakfast”
(Fivush & Hamond, 1990, p. 231). This focus on general event information in young
children’s AM may stem from their insuﬃcient EK to help them fully appreciate the
unique and ultimately memorable aspects of novel events. As a result, they tend to
understand and organize event information following familiar scripts.

Over the preschool years, children show increasing abilities to understand and dif-
ferentiate a wide range of situations eliciting a variety of emotions (Bennett, Bend-
ersky, & Lewis, 2005; Harris, 1989; Stein & Liwag, 1997). They also show
increasing abilities to retain and recall distinctive aspects of past events (Fivush,
Haden, & Adam, 1995; Pillemer & White, 1989), and their memories include not
only event-speciﬁc details but also emotional-evaluative information such as mental
states and aﬀect – commonly referred to as internal states language (Fivush & Baker-
Ward, 2005; Haden, Haine, & Fivush, 1997). Particularly important from the current
perspective, the integration of internal states language into memories may be indic-
ative of cognitive appraisal, self-involvement, and aﬀective organization of the event
information enabled by EK. It is possible that the further development of EK helps
children understand the personal signiﬁcance of speciﬁc events, experience appropri-
ate emotions during the events, and organize the event information in a structured
fashion, thereby facilitating the retention of and access to the event memories over
the long term. Evidence from a recent study showed that EK in 3-year-olds had a
concurrent association with the children’s ability to recall speciﬁc event information
(Wang, Hutt, Kulkofsky, McDermott, & Wei, 2006).

Notably, the relationship between EK and AM may well be reciprocal, particu-
larly at the early stage of development. EK may be built upon or abstracted from
a variety of unique and speciﬁc personal experiences, and its development may in
turn facilitate children’s understanding, evaluation, and remembering of autobio-
graphical events. Later on, EK, as a schematic knowledge structure, may become
increasingly stabilized and context-free, and may thus be no longer susceptible to
or malleable by the inﬂuence of discrete experiences. Rather, it may continue to pro-

120

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

vide the cognitive bases upon which signiﬁcant personal event information can be
interpreted, processed, organized, and retained.

1.3. Cross-cultural variations

Cross-cultural research further suggests a connection between EK and AM at the
group level. When asked to recount recent autobiographical events (e.g., one thing
the child did recently that was special and fun), Euro-American preschoolers often
recall more speciﬁc episodes (e.g., ‘‘getting a new toy”) than Chinese children, who tend
to report more general routine events (e.g., ‘‘playing with toys every day”) (Han,
Leichtman, & Wang, 1998; Wang, 2004; Wang, 2006a). The tendency to provide gen-
eral responses to a speciﬁc memory probe is thought to suggest a lack of accessibility to
episodic event information (Pillemer, 1998; Singer & Salovey, 1993; Wang, 2001a).
Furthermore, Euro-American children more frequently use internal states language
to refer to their feelings, thoughts, and subjective evaluations in their memory accounts
than do Chinese children (Han et al., 1998; Wang, 2004). The early diﬀerences in the
speciﬁcity and emotional-evaluative content of AM appear to increase with age and
persist into adulthood. Compared with native Chinese and Asian Americans, Euro-
American adults more frequently recall speciﬁc episodes and provide more event-spe-
ciﬁc details and emotional-evaluative information in their memory reports (Wang,
2001a; Wang, 2006b; Wang & Conway, 2004; Wang & Ross, 2005).

If the cultural diﬀerences in memory speciﬁcity and internal states language are
related to EK, then Euro-American children should be expected to have better grasp
of EK than Chinese children. Indeed, when asked to judge the emotional nature of
story situations or to describe situations likely to provoke various emotions, Euro-
American preschoolers score higher than their Chinese peers regardless of age,
and they make more rapid progress in EK over time (Wang, 2003; Wang et al.,
2006). Conceivably, the greater EK in Euro-American children may help them better
appreciate the emotional meaning of past events and better remember speciﬁc details
of the events.

The cultural variation in children’s EK may result from diﬀerent emotion social-
ization practices in Euro-American and Chinese families. In line with the cultural
emphasis on autonomy and the view of emotions as an indication of individuality,
middle-class Euro-American parents are often eager to raise an ‘‘emotionally intelli-
gent” child (Chao, 1995; Gottman, 1998). They frequently discuss emotions with
children, explain the antecedents of children’s feeling states, and encourage children
to articulate their own feelings (Wang, 2001b; Wang & Fivush, 2005). Such practices
directly contribute to children’s developing EK (Burch, Austin, & Bauer, 2004; Den-
ham & Kochanoﬀ, 2002). In contrast, in Chinese culture where emotions are tradi-
tionally viewed as potentially destructive to interpersonal harmony, parents are not
preoccupied with helping children understand emotions but instead emphasizing
psychological discipline and behavioral standards (Chao, 1995; Chen, 2000). Family
conversations about emotions often focus on ‘‘teaching the child a lesson” and help-
ing the child develop proper conduct through acceptance of social norms, with little
causal discussion of the child’s feeling states (Wang, 2001b; Wang & Fivush, 2005).

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

121

These diﬀerent beliefs and practices may contribute to diﬀerent levels of emotional
understanding in children, which may, in turn, inﬂuence children’s developing AM.

1.4. The present research

The relation of EK to AM, once established, will have rich theoretical and empir-
ical implications. This longitudinal study is the ﬁrst to examine the developmental
connection between EK and AM. Situating the study in a cross-cultural context fur-
ther makes it possible to test whether the contribution of EK to AM can be general-
ized across cultures. Native Chinese children, Chinese immigrant children in the
U.S., and Euro-American children were interviewed at ages 3, 3.5, and 4.5. The
shorter interval between the ﬁrst two interviews was intended to capture the rapid
changes in both AM and EK during this age period (Nelson & Fivush, 2004; Stein
& Liwag, 1997), and in light of the ﬁndings that adults’ earliest childhood recollec-
tions become available from around 3 to 3.5 years of age (Mullen, 1994; Pillemer &
White, 1989). At the cultural level, Euro-American children were expected to exhibit
greater EK than their Chinese peers, consistent with the divergent family socializa-
tion practices evident early in the children’s lives (Chao, 1995; Chen, 2000; Wang,
2001b). And this, in turn, would contribute to greater abilities in Euro-American
children to remember event-speciﬁc details and to incorporate emotional-evaluative
information into their memories.

Unlike most cross-cultural research that focuses on comparisons between diﬀerent
cultural groups, this study included two Chinese samples. Chinese children in China
and the U.S. were expected to show diﬀerential developmental changes as they come
to be in greater contact with the world outside home and subjected to increasing
inﬂuences from multiple cultural sources such as media, peers, and socialization
agents other than parents. Speciﬁcally, Chinese children in the U.S., especially those
from the ﬁrst-generation immigrant families, are often socialized with traditional
Chinese values and practices at home, such as mutual dependence, emotional
restraint, and social conformity (Chao & Tseng, 2002). As they grow older and
are more exposed to cultural inﬂuences outside home, they may become increasingly
acculturated to mainstream American values such as autonomy, self-expression, and
personal eﬃcacy, and subjected to practices that facilitate their emotional under-
standing and personal remembering (Lee & Zane, 1998; Tobin, Wu, & Davidson,
1989). In comparison, the cultural transition for native Chinese children, especially
those in big cities like Beijing, may entail an opposite process. In the past two dec-
ades Chinese families have undergone major changes in family structures and prac-
tices due to drastic modernization, Western inﬂuences, and the one-child policy
(Chen, Cen, Li, & He, 2005; Wang, Leichtman, & White, 1998). These changes
are particularly reﬂected in the so-called ‘‘4-2-1 syndrome,” whereby six doting
adults (four grandparents and two parents) pour their attention onto one child.
Oftentimes, to satisfy the desires and wishes of the ‘‘little emperor” or ‘‘little
empress” takes precedence over behavioral discipline, and parents seem more open
than before with respect to discussing feelings with their children (Wang & Fivush,
2005). Outside the family, however, the larger cultural context continues to reinforce

122

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

collective values and children are expected to control their emotions and impulses for
maintaining social harmony (Chen, 2000; Fuligni & Zhang, 2004; Tobin et al., 1989).
It is possible then that at the earlier time points the native Chinese group would exhi-
bit a more Western pattern of child outcomes than would the Chinese immigrant
group, and this might be reversed by the end of the preschool years.

At the individual level, children’s EK was expected to uniquely predict their abil-
ities to remember event-speciﬁc details and to integrate emotional-evaluative infor-
mation into their memories, regardless of culture. EK was further expected to
mediate cultural inﬂuences on children’s developing AM speciﬁcity. Notably, past
research has shown that language skills predict better emotional understanding in
children (Cutting & Dunn, 1999; Pons, Lawson, Harris, & deRosnay, 2003). Con-
ceivably, being an instrument of both cognitive representation and social communi-
cation, language may enable children to understand and use emotion terms and to
learn EK through participation in discussions of feeling states with others (Denham
& Kochanoﬀ, 2002; Denham et al., 1994; Dunn, Bretherton, & Munn, 1987). Simi-
larly, research has suggested a positive impact of language on children’s memory per-
formance (Nelson & Fivush, 2004; Simcock & Hayne, 2003). A language measure
was thus included at each time point.

2. Method

2.1. Participants

Data collection took place at three time points. At Time 1, 189 children participated
(mean age = 34.93 months, SD = 3.17), including 58 Chinese children (25 girls) from
Beijing, China, and 60 ﬁrst-generation Chinese immigrant children (30 girls) and 71
Euro-American children (34 girls) from upstate New York. Children were recruited
through local nursery schools and by word of mouth, and were taking part in a larger
longitudinal study of early memory development. All children came from middle-class
families and the majority of mothers and fathers had college education or beyond. All
Chinese children and approximately 30% Euro-American and 45% Chinese immigrant
children were from only-child families. At Time 2, 170 children remained in the sample
(mean age = 41.63 months, SD = 3.18), including 48 Chinese (21 girls), 57 Chinese
immigrant (28 girls), and 65 Euro-American children (33 girls). At Time 3, the sample
consisted of 153 children (mean age = 53.92 months, SD = 3.42), including 47 Chinese
(21 girls), 43 Chinese immigrant (21 girls), and 63 Euro-American children (31 girls).
The majority of the children who failed to complete all three time points were unavail-
able due to family move. There was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in any measure between
children who continued to participate and those who did not.

2.2. Procedure

Three home visits were arranged for each participating family by two native
female researchers. English–Chinese bilingual researchers visited the Chinese immi-

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

123

grant families and interviewed children in the language children preferred. All mate-
rials were written in both English and Chinese and translation and back-translation
procedure was carried out to ensure their equivalence in both literal and sense mean-
ing (Chapman & Carter, 1979). The AM and EK tasks took approximately 20 min
and were videotaped.

2.3. Measures

2.3.1. Autobiographical memory

During each visit, one of the researchers (interviewer) asked the mother to nom-
inate two speciﬁc, one-moment-in time events that happened to the child within the
past 2 months. After engaging the child in warm-up conversation, she told the child,
‘‘Your Mom just told me that. . .(e.g., you went to the amusement park last week).
I’ve never been there before. Tell me what you did. I really want to know.” Standard
prompts were used such as ‘‘What else happened?” and ‘‘Can you tell me more about
it?” This procedure is standard in studies of children’s independent AM (Haden
et al., 1997; Harley & Reese., 1999; Wang, 2004).

Coding was performed in the original languages. Noldus The ObserverÒ 5.0 pro-
gram was used, a digital coding system designed to score video materials online and
enter the codes directly into a computer (Noldus, 2003). Proposition, a subject–verb
construction, was used as the coding unit (e.g., ‘‘I swung;” Fivush et al., 1995).
Reponses to the two memory events were coded separately and the mean frequencies
per event were then calculated for analysis. (1) Memory speciﬁcity: Children’s utter-
ances concerning distinct aspects of the past event in question were classiﬁed as spe-
ciﬁc responses (e.g., ‘‘We went apple-picking”) (Harley & Reese., 1999). Utterances,
although relevant to the topic, not directly about what happened in the past event
but of generic information, were coded as general responses (e.g., ‘‘Xiangshan is a
park. There are a lot of trees”) (Wang et al., 2006). Speciﬁc and general responses
were mutually exclusive and exhaustive. Placeholders (e.g., ‘‘I don’t know”) and
oﬀ-topic talk (e.g., talking about the camera) were infrequent and not coded. Follow-
ing previous research (Wang & Ross, 2005), the diﬀerence between speciﬁc and gen-
eral responses was taken to form a composite measure of memory speciﬁcity. (2)
Internal states language: Children’s utterances referring to their emotions, thoughts,
desires, and subjective evaluations were counted (e.g., ‘‘I was a little bit angry,” and
‘‘I wanted a balloon”) (Haden et al., 1997; Han et al., 1998). Two coders indepen-
dently coded 20% of each dataset for reliability. The average kappas were .87
(.67–1) for Chinese children, .85 (.65–1) for Chinese immigrant children, and .86
(.69–1) for Euro-American children. Thus, all average kappas were within the sub-
stantial to excellent range (Fleiss, 1981).

2.3.2. Emotion knowledge

Following the memory task, the interviewer assessed children’s EK in a task that
has been used with children in diﬀerent cultures (Harris, Olthof, Terwogt, & Hard-
man, 1987; Wang et al., 2006). Children were asked to describe situations likely to
provoke happy, sad, fearful, or angry emotions. The interviewer presented the child

124

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

with the emotion terms one at a time and asked the child for descriptions of situa-
tions that may make people as well as the child him- or herself experience the emo-
tion in question (e.g., ‘‘What makes people feel sad?” and ‘‘What makes you feel
sad?”). For each question, she prompted the child to respond with as many situa-
tions as possible (e.g., ‘‘What else makes people (you) sad?”).

The number of emotion-eliciting situations children provided for each emotion
was counted (e.g., I: ‘‘What makes people feel happy?” C: ‘‘Saying something that
makes them smile” and I: ‘‘What makes you feel mad?” C: ‘‘Not giving me what I
want”). Responses pertaining to the four emotions showed consistent patterns of
variations across groups and time points. An aggregated score across the four emo-
tions was thus used as each child’s ﬁnal EK score at each time point. Two coders
independently coded 20% of each dataset for reliability. The average kappas were
.90 (.76–1) for Chinese children, .87 (.71–1) for Chinese immigrant children, and
.87 (.66–1) for Euro-American children.

2.3.3. Language

During the child interview, mothers ﬁlled out the language scales of the Child
Development Inventory (CDI; Ireton, 1992) that assessed children’s language pro-
duction and comprehension (possible score range 0–100; Cronbach’s a = .93, .91,
and .86 at ages 3, 3.5, and 4.5, respectively). Mothers answered ‘‘Yes” or ‘‘No” to
statements that describe the child’s language ability (e.g., ‘‘Gives reasons for things,
using the word ‘because. . .’” and ‘‘Understands what ‘before’ and ‘after’ mean; uses
these words correctly”). The CDI is an updated version of the Minnesota Child
Development Inventory (MCDI; Ireton & Thwing, 1974) and has been used in pre-
vious research on preschoolers’ EK and AM (Denham et al., 1994; Wang, 2006a).

3. Results

Analyses were directed at examining the developmental connection of EK to AM

at group and individual levels.

3.1. Preliminary analyses

Across the three time points, only a small percentage of children scored 0 for spe-
ciﬁc responses (10%, 2.5%, and 0.5%) or EK (10%, 2.5%, and 2.5%). The two vari-
ables and the composite memory speciﬁcity score (i.e., speciﬁc-general responses)
were analyzed as continuous variables. All the continuous variables were positively
skewed, with a small number of children scoring higher than most. Logarithmic
transformations were thus performed on the variables before they were submitted
to analysis. To facilitate comparisons with previous research, untransformed means
are reported. A great percentage of children at each time point did not provide any
general responses or internal states language. The two variables were thus dummy
coded, respectively, with children who provided at least one response scored as 1
and those who made no relevant response scored as 0. The dummy variables were

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

125

then used in analysis, although both means and percentages of the two memory
codes are reported.

In the following analyses, continuous variables were analyzed with mixed models
using SAS PROC MIXED program (Singer, 1998), and categorical (dummy) vari-
ables were analyzed with generalized estimating equations using the SAS GEE
macro (Norton, Bieler, Ennett, & Zarkin, 1996). Signiﬁcant (p < .05) multivariate
eﬀects were followed up with univariate or post-hoc Tukey–Kramer honestly signif-
icant diﬀerence [HSD] tests, as appropriate, at the p < .05 level. Some children did
not complete every task, thus the degrees of freedom varied slightly across tests.
Gender and age of child at each time point showed no signiﬁcant eﬀects in prelimin-
ary analyses; and consistent with prior research (Wang, 2004; Wang et al., 2006),
there were no birth order eﬀects within the Euro-American and Chinese immigrant
samples. These factors were therefore not considered further. Language scores
(Ms = 76.56, 86.36, 94.25, SDs = 15.01, 11.82, 6.73) were signiﬁcantly correlated
with EK scores at each time point (age 3: r = .27, p = .0002; age 3.5: r = .29,
p = .0001; age 4.5: r = .22, p = .007), with memory speciﬁcity scores at the ﬁrst
two time points (age 3: r = .15, p = .04; age 3.5: r = .20, p = .009), and with internal
states language at Time 2 (r = .17, p = .03). Language was thus included as a covar-
iate in all analyses.

3.2. Emotion knowledge across groups and time points

A 3 (culture)  3 (time point) mixed model analysis was conducted on EK, with
culture being a between-subject factor, time point being a within-subject factor, and
subject being a random factor. Language was included as a covariate. Signiﬁcant
main eﬀects of culture, F(2, 186) = 19.69, p < .0001, DR2 = .22, and time point
emerged, F(2, 313) = 33.87, p < .0001, DR2 = .09, qualiﬁed by a culture  time point
interaction, F(4, 313) = 8.15, p < .0001, DR2 = .08. Language was a signiﬁcant covar-
iate, F(1, 313) = 9.66, p = .002, DR2 = .10. Post-hoc tests indicated that Euro-Amer-
ican children had signiﬁcantly higher EK scores than both Chinese groups at ages 3,
had higher scores than Chinese immigrant children at age 3.5 and than native Chi-
nese children at age 4.5. The two Chinese groups did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from
each other at any time point. Furthermore, while Euro-American and Chinese immi-
grant children showed increases in EK over time, particular from ages 3.5 to 4.5,
native Chinese children showed an increase from ages 3 to 3.5 and then no signiﬁcant
change between the later two time points. Fig. 1 illustrates the untransformed mean
EK scores as a function of culture and time point.

3.3. Predicting autobiographical memory

3.3.1. AM speciﬁcity

The analysis of the composite memory speciﬁcity score aimed at testing the
hypotheses that EK would not only uniquely predict children’s ability to remember
speciﬁc event information, but also serve as a potent mediator for the eﬀects of cul-
ture on memory speciﬁcity. A 3 (culture)  3 (time point) mixed model analysis was

ﬁrst conducted on memory speciﬁcity score, with language being a covariate. The
model yielded signiﬁcant main eﬀects of culture, F(2, 184) = 7.90, p = .0005,
DR2 = 22,
time point, F(2, 292) = 8.44, p = .0003, DR2 = .02, and language,
F(1, 292) = 4.73, p = .03, DR2 = .01. Post-hoc tests indicated that Euro-American
children scored higher on memory speciﬁcity than did Chinese immigrant children
at ages 3 and 3.5, and they scored higher than did native Chinese children at age
4.5. Native Chinese children had higher speciﬁcity scores than Chinese immigrant
children at age 3.5. Furthermore, Euro-American and Chinese immigrant children
showed increases in memory speciﬁcity overtime, with the increase between ages 3
and 3.5 being signiﬁcant for both groups. Native Chinese children showed an
increase from ages 3 to 3.5 and then a decrease by age 4.5, although the diﬀerence
between the later two time points was not signiﬁcant. Children with greater language
skills had higher memory speciﬁcity scores.
Note that it was established in the previous section that culture, time point, and
language also had signiﬁcant eﬀects on EK. Next, a 3 (culture)  3 (time
point)  EK mixed model analysis was conducted on memory speciﬁcity score, with
language being a covariate. This model yielded only a main eﬀect of EK,
F(1, 285) = 49.94, p < .0001, DR2 = .40, whereby children with greater EK had
higher speciﬁcity scores regardless of culture, time point, and language skills. No
eﬀects pertaining to culture, time point, or language neared signiﬁcance (Fs < .73,
ps > .48), suggesting that the eﬀects of the independent variables (culture, time point,
language) on memory speciﬁcity were attenuated by the mediation path (EK). Thus,
all conditions for mediation were met (Baron & Kenny, 1986). Consistent with the

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

127

hypotheses, EK not only uniquely predicted memory speciﬁcity but also mediated
the eﬀects of other factors, including culture, to occur.
To further understand the nature of children’s AM over time and across groups, a
3 (culture)  3 (time point)  EK analysis was performed on speciﬁc and general
responses, respectively. Language was included as a covariate. The mixed model
analysis of speciﬁc responses yielded a main eﬀect of EK, F(1, 298) = 55.25,
p < .0001, DR2 = .47. There was no signiﬁcant interaction between EK and culture
or time point. Thus, EK uniquely predicted speciﬁc responses across cultures and
time points. Language was not a signiﬁcant covariate. A marginally signiﬁcant eﬀect
of time point also emerged, F(2, 298) = 2.42, p = .09, DR2 = .04, qualiﬁed by a cul-
ture  time point interaction, F(4, 298) = 2.76, p = .03, DR2 = .09. Post-hoc tests
indicated that Euro-American children provided more speciﬁc responses than Chi-
nese immigrant children at ages 3 and 3.5, and than native Chinese children at age
4.5. Native Chinese children provided more speciﬁc responses than Chinese immi-
grant children at age 3.5, and the direction of the diﬀerence was reversed at age
4.5. Furthermore, Euro-American children showed a fast increase in their number
of speciﬁc responses from ages 3 to 3.5 and then remained at a high response level
to age 4.5. Chinese immigrant children showed a signiﬁcant increase at each time
point. Native Chinese children showed an increase from ages 3 to 3.5 and then a
decrease by age 4.5, although the diﬀerence between the later two points was not
signiﬁcant.
The generalized estimating equation analysis of general responses based on the
dummy code showed a signiﬁcant culture  time point interaction, v2(4) = 23.59,
p < .0001. While Euro-American children did not show changes over time in the like-
lihood of providing general responses (38%, 38%, 47%), v2(2) = .66, n.s., both Chi-
nese (21%, 26%, 64%) and Chinese immigrant children (5%, 4%, 64%) showed a
signiﬁcant increase from ages 3.5 to 4.5, v2(1, N = 91) = 16.46, p < .0001, r = .43,
and v2(1, N = 99) = 20.95, p < .0001, r = .46, respectively. EK had no signiﬁcant
eﬀects on general responses. Language was not a signiﬁcant covariate. Fig. 2 illus-
trates the untransformed means of AM speciﬁcity, speciﬁc responses, and general
responses as a function of culture and time point.

3.3.2. Internal states language

A 3 (culture)  3 (time point)  EK generalized estimating equation analysis of
internal states language revealed a signiﬁcant main eﬀect of EK, v2(1) = 15.19,
p < .0001. As expected, children with greater EK were more likely to use internal
states language in their memories regardless of culture and time point. Furthermore,
a marginally signiﬁcant culture  time point interaction emerged, v2(4) = 8.93,
p = .06. Euro-American children (45%, 46%, 53%) were more likely than native Chi-
nese children (28%, 30%, 23%) to refer to internal states in their memories at all time
points, age 3 v2(1, N = 128) = 3.95, p = .05, r = .18, age 3.5 v2(1, N = 112) = 3.11,
p = .08, r = .17, and age 4.5 v2(1, N = 102) = 10.17, p = .001, r = .32, respectively.
Euro-American children were also more likely than Chinese immigrant children
(23%, 14%, 49%) to integrate internal states language into their memories at age
3, v2(1, N = 131) = 6.89, p = .009, r = .23, and age 3.5, v2(1, N = 122) = 15.39,

to refer to internal states at age 3.5, v2(1, N = 104) = 3.84, p = .05, r = .19, and this
pattern was reversed at age 4.5, v2(1, N = 87) = 6.57, p = .01, r = .27. Language was

3.4. Emotion knowledge and autobiographical memory over time

To further examine the relation of EK to memory speciﬁcity across time points
independent of culture and language skills, cross-lagged correlational analyses were
conducted between EK and speciﬁcity scores, with the eﬀects of culture and language
partialed out. Fig. 4 presents the partial correlations. At the earlier two time points, a
reciprocal relationship between EK and AM was observed, whereby children who
demonstrated greater emotional understanding at age 3 were able to provide event
memories with greater speciﬁcity 6 months later, and children who recalled more spe-
ciﬁc memories at age 3 exhibited greater EK 6 months later. EK and speciﬁcity
scores were also correlated within each time point. Thus, EK and memory speciﬁcity
were interrelated early on, showing concurrent and longitudinal bidirectionality.

At the later two time points, however, the long-term relationship between EK and
memory speciﬁcity became unidirectional. Children who demonstrated greater EK
at age 3.5 were better able to provide episodic event information 1 year later, regardless

that children who exhibited greater EK and memory speciﬁcity at the earlier time

4. Discussion

The present study takes a novel theoretical perspective on the early development
of autobiographical memory, examining the developmental connection of emotion
knowledge to autobiographical remembering. The ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst longitu-
dinal evidence for the contribution of emotion knowledge to autobiographical mem-
ory development. The examination of individual processes within a cross-cultural
framework further helps to identify universal parameters on memory development,
as well as mechanisms that give rise to cultural variations. The study thus adds sig-
niﬁcance to autobiographical memory theory in general, and to the understanding of
both cultural variations and individual diﬀerences in cognition.

As expected, EK was linked to AM at the group level. Compared with their Chi-
nese and Chinese immigrant peers, Euro-American children exhibited overall greater
understanding of emotion situations; and they recalled autobiographical events with
greater speciﬁcity and integrated more internal states language into their memories.
In addition, Euro-American and Chinese immigrant children exhibited an overall
increase in memory speciﬁcity, corresponding with their increasing EK over time.
Native Chinese children showed increases in EK and memory speciﬁcity at the earlier
two time points, and had no increase in either outcome and, indeed, a decrease in
memory speciﬁcity from ages 3.5 to 4.5. Interestingly, while Euro-American children
provided more speciﬁc responses with age, the number of general responses they
included in their memory reports remained constant over time. In contrast, both
native Chinese and Chinese immigrant children signiﬁcantly increased their use of
general responses by the end of the preschool years, and native Chinese children’s
speciﬁc responses indeed showed a decrease, although not signiﬁcant, from ages
3.5 to 4.5. Thus, the focus on distinctive aspects of past events in autobiographical
remembering evidenced diﬀerential developmental patterns across
cultures.
Although moderate use of general descriptions relevant to the past event may help
to supplement contextual information and ensure the coherence and comprehensibil-
ity of the memory narrative, a great tendency to provide general responses to a spe-
ciﬁc memory probe, particularly in the case of native Chinese children by the end of
the preschool years, may be indicative of a lack of accessibility to episodic event
information (Pillemer, 1998; Singer & Salovey, 1993; Wang, 2001a).

At the individual level, children’s EK facilitated their memory speciﬁcity and their
use of internal states language across all time points, independent of culture and lan-
guage skills. Thus, children who showed greater understanding of emotions recalled
memories with more event-speciﬁc details and emotional-evaluative information
than children who had less emotion knowledge, regardless of culture and language
skills. Furthermore, as predicted, EK functioned as a potent mediator that gave rise
to cultural diﬀerences in memory speciﬁcity. EK also mediated the contributions of
language skills and time point to memory speciﬁcity, such that children’s increasing
memory speciﬁcity in relation to their language skills or the mere passing of time was
explained by their developing EK. In addition, the long-term relationship between
EK and memory speciﬁcity appeared to be reciprocal early on and became unidirec-
tional later. At the early stage, children may learn about emotions from their unique

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

131

personal experiences, which, in turn, enables them to interpret, understand, and
remember autobiographical episodes. By the end of the preschool years, children
have come to form fairly sophisticated knowledge of a variety of emotion-eliciting
situations (Bennett et al., 2005; Harris, 1989; Stein & Liwag, 1997). Such emotional
schemas or scripts represent abstracted information and are likely resistant to dis-
crete experiential inﬂuences (Conway & Bekerian, 1987), while, on the other hand,
they continue to facilitate children’s understanding, evaluation, and remembering
of distinctive aspects of past events over the long term.

The ﬁndings may shed light on the phenomenon of infantile amnesia, that is, the
common inability among adults to consciously recall autobiographical events occur-
ring before age 2 or 3 (see Pillemer & White, 1989). From the current perspective, the
oﬀset of infantile amnesia may be inﬂuenced by developmental changes in cognitive
and emotional processing of event information enabled by the developing emotion
knowledge. Because children develop EK over the preschool years (Bennett et al.,
2005; Denham & Kochanoﬀ, 2002), the insuﬃcient EK in very young children
may render them with inadequate ‘‘mental tools” necessary for interpreting, repre-
senting, organizing, and retrieving unique episodic event information. This may
make the retention of and access to the early memories diﬃcult from an adult stand-
point and thus result in infantile amnesia. Obviously, further longitudinal data are
needed to elucidate the possible eﬀect of emotion knowledge on infantile amnesia.
The ﬁndings may further help to explain cross-cultural diﬀerences in adults’ child-
hood recollections. Studies have shown that Euro-American adults can access earlier
and a greater number of childhood memories and often provide more episodic
details and emotional-evaluative information of past events than Chinese, Koreans,
and Asian Americans (Mullen, 1994; Wang, 2001a; Wang, Conway, & Hou, 2004;
Wang & Ross, 2005). These cultural diﬀerences may be related to the current ﬁnding
that Euro-American children as young as age 3 acquired greater EK than their Chi-
nese peers, and such knowledge may, in turn, facilitate their detailed encoding and
eﬃcient organization of personal event information for long-term retention.

As expected, interesting diﬀerences emerged between the two Chinese groups. At
the earlier time points, Chinese children in Beijing showed greater similarities to
Euro-American children in both EK and AM measures than did Chinese immigrant
children. This pattern was reversed by the end of the preschool years, where Chinese
immigrant children came to resemble more their Euro-American peers than native
Chinese children in both EK and AM outcomes. This pattern of results may reﬂect
the diﬀerential enculturation processes from home to the outside world for native
and immigrant Chinese children, as they get older and more susceptible to the inﬂu-
ences of socialization agents and cultural sources other than parents. One such
important inﬂuence, for instance, is through early education programs. In Mainland
China, many educators are concerned that ‘‘in single-child families, the child receives
too much attention at home and, as a result, is spoiled.” A major task at day-care
centers and preschools is therefore to train children to ‘‘observe rules and regula-
tions, be polite to teachers, follow rules in games, and think about others” (Lee,
1992, p. 383). And to bridge the divergent practices between home and school, par-
ents are asked ‘‘to cooperate with day-care centers by training their child at home in

132

Q. Wang / Cognition 108 (2008) 117–135

accordance with the center’s goals” (Lee, 1992, p. 387). In contrast, day-care centers
and preschools in the U.S. place a great emphasis on the rights and priority of the
individual child, and a major purpose of early education is to ‘‘promote life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness,” and to ‘‘teach children to exercise their rights of free
speech” (Tobin et al., 1989, p. 137). It appears that under such cultural inﬂuences,
native Chinese children are gradually being transformed from ‘‘little emperors”
and ‘‘little empresses” in the family to eﬀective members of a larger collective,
whereas Chinese immigrant children in the U.S. are being socialized into a society
embracing individuality and self-assertiveness (Chao & Tseng, 2002; Wang et al.,
1998). The current results elucidate cultural inﬂuences on human development as
a dynamic process that takes place in the transactions between individuals and their
proximal social settings (Rogoﬀ, 2003). They also point to the importance of exam-
ining in future research multiple sociocultural factors in predicting developmental
outcomes.

Notably, although the present study provided compelling evidence for the
developmental connection of emotion knowledge to autobiographical memory,
the data did not directly explicate basic level cognitive and emotional processes
underlying such a connection. As suggested by cognitive theories (Conway &
Bekerian, 1987; Stein & Liwag, 1997), emotion knowledge may aﬀect the remem-
bering of personal experiences through multiple pathways. The ﬁnding that EK
facilitated the integration of feeling states language into memories is suggestive
pertaining to these pathways. As resent research has shown, children interpret,
understand, and evaluate the personal meaning of past events through the use
of internal states language that is indicative of cognitive and emotional processing
(Fivush & Baker-Ward, 2005). Still, further research is required to elucidate the
speciﬁc processes and mechanisms for the mnemonic eﬀects of emotion knowl-
edge. It should also be acknowledged that the current sample was composed of
middle-class families in the U.S. and China with relatively high educational levels,
which could aﬀect memory and emotion socialization practices within the families
(Wang et al., 1998; Wiley, Rose, Burger, & Miller, 1998). Additional research
exploring a wider variety of socio-economic classes and parental educational lev-
els is needed. In addition, discrete emotions are often associated with diﬀerent
goals and problem-solving strategies and thus may diﬀerentially impact on auto-
biographical remembering (Levine & Pizarro, 2004). Future research should
examine how children’s knowledge of speciﬁc emotions inﬂuences the way they
remember events in which they experienced the emotions.

Importantly, emotion knowledge may only be one of many factors contributing to
early memory development (see Nelson & Fivush, 2004). This is consistent with the
pluralistic view that autobiographical memory development is a result of interactions
among various biological, linguistic, cognitive, and social-cultural variables (Harley
& Reese., 1999; Nelson & Fivush, 2004; Pillemer, 1998). Still, with the acquisition
and further enrichment of emotion knowledge, children become increasingly able
to interpret, represent, and organize signiﬁcant personal event memories for long-
term retention. Emotion knowledge may thus be one of the prerequisites to the
development of autobiographical memory.
