Developmental continuity between infants’ understanding of intentional agency (goals, beliefs, and desires)
and young children’s attributions of moral intentions were studied in a 4-year longitudinal study (N = 77 chil-
dren). First, goal encoding at the age of 7 months and implicit false belief understanding at 18 months were
predictive of children’s understanding of an accidental transgressor’s moral intentions at the age of 5 years.
Second, 24-month-olds’ understanding of subjective desires was predictive of children’s ability to understand
an accidental transgressor’s false belief at 5 years. These correlations remained signiﬁcant when controlling for
gender and verbal IQ. These ﬁndings support the theory that an early understanding of intentional agency is
foundational for moral cognition in childhood.

intentionality is central

An understanding of
for
moral judgment. Determining the moral status of
an act necessitates knowing one’s intentions when
interacting with others (Turiel, 2002). For example,
children understand that pushing someone so that
they avoid a more serious injury such as falling
from a ladder is viewed as a morally worthy action
due to the avoidance of detrimental harm to
another (Jambon & Smetana, 2014).
In contrast,
pushing someone out of dislike because of the color
of their skin or the language they speak has been
judged as a violation of moral norms about the fair
treatment of others (Killen, Mulvey, & Hitti, 2013).

to focus on intentionality in the context of chil-
dren’s moral

younger children (3–6 years of age) focus on out-
comes rather than intentions. More recent research
has shown, however,
that children as young as
3 years can distinguish between intentional and
accidental acts and assign more blame when harm

was done intentionally than when it was caused
accidentally (Chandler, Sokol, & Hallett, 2001;
Chandler, Sokol, & Wainryb, 2000; Yuill & Perner,
1988). Furthermore, moral judgment in early child-
hood involves an understanding of the distinction
between acts and consequences; well-intentioned
acts with negative outcomes are evaluated differ-
ently from negatively intentioned acts with positive
outcomes
for a
review).

(see Killen & Smetana, 2015,

An understanding of

intentionality does not
emerge for the ﬁrst time in preschool aged children,
it has its origins in infancy. Infants in the 1st and
2nd years of life interpret human action in terms of
agents’ goals and intentions rather than spatiotem-
poral surface properties of actions (Woodward,
2009). Furthermore, they distinguish between inten-
tional and accidental action outcomes, and they
reenact intended actions when they observe a failed
attempt (Meltzoff, 1995). Moreover, infants in the
2nd year of life begin to appreciate the subjectivity
of desires (Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997), and they
take agents’ epistemic states into account when
inferring their action goals. In particular, infants in
the 2nd year of life anticipate an agent’s action

understanding of intentional action, but also longi-
tudinal studies indicate that infants’ agent represen-

Duran, LaBounty, and Hamilton (2008) assessed
understanding of goal-directed action in 10- to 12-
month-old infants (N = 45) in a habituation task
and tested these children again at the age of 4 years
with a theory-of-mind battery. Decrement of atten-
tion in the habituation task predicted later false
belief understanding, when controlling for IQ, exec-
utive function, and verbal competence. This study
corroborated earlier ﬁndings by Wellman, Phillips,
Dunphy-Lelii, and LaLonde (2004)
in a smaller
sample (see also Aschersleben, Hofer, & Jovanovic,
2008; Yamaguchi, Kuhlmeier, Wynn, & VanMarle,
2009, for converging ﬁndings). While these studies

standing of agents’ goals and preschoolers’ false

one

To date, the relationship between infant psycho-
logical reasoning (goals, beliefs, and desires) and
the development of moral intentions in early child-
hood has not been investigated. Given that inten-
tion understanding is foundational
for morality,
and given that infant understanding of intentional
action is predictive of later false belief understand-
ing, we expected developmental relations between
core elements of infant psychological reasoning and
later moral
judgment. Therefore, we conducted a
longitudinal study testing for predictive relations
between infants’ understanding of goals, beliefs,
and desires as core components of psychological
reasoning in infancy, and 5-year-old children’s
moral judgment in a context that required a repre-
sentation of a transgressor’s false belief.

Our proposal is that theory of mind, the ability
to know that other agents have mental states differ-
ent from the self (e.g., Premack & Woodruff, 1978),
and moral understanding, which comprises pre-
scriptive norms about the interindividual treatment
of others regarding fairness and equal treatment

is a prerequisite for moral judgment in the sense
that children need to be able to infer an agent’s
intentions to morally evaluate another’s acts, and
sometimes an agent’s intentions can only be under-
stood when the beliefs of another are correctly rep-
resented. But there is also the reverse direction of
inﬂuence, for example, the valence of a morally
relevant act inﬂuences intentionality judgments in
children (Leslie, Knobe, & Cohen, 2006). To date,
the importance of theory-of-mind competence for
the development of moral judgment has primarily
been discussed for explicit
theory of mind and
explicit moral judgment in early childhood (Asting-
ton, 2004). Recently, a longitudinal study demon-
strated
theory-of-mind
competence and prototypic moral judgments (e.g.,
hitting someone for no reason; Smetana, Jambon,
Conry-Murray, & Sturge-Apple, 2012).
It has also been theorized that

intentionality
knowledge and moral knowledge reﬂect two dis-
tinct forms of reasoning (psychological and moral,
respectively)
in early development.
Young children’s failure to interpret others’ inten-
tional states correctly in morally relevant situations
may often reﬂect a failure to coordinate moral
judgment with mental state attribution when both
forms of considerations are simultaneously pre-
sented in a multifaceted context (Killen et al., 2013;
Smetana,
Jambon, & Ball, 2014). For example,
young children who understand that hitting is
wrong (see Smetana, 2006) nonetheless often assign
blame to a peer who commits a transgression when
he or she did not mean to do it. In this case, chil-
dren understand the wrongness of the act but make
errors when inferring the intentions of the potential
transgressor,
thus showing an understanding of
harm in terms of the intrinsic experiences of a vic-
tim but failing to apply mental state knowledge to
the situation.

that coexist

Systematic empirical investigations of the interre-
lationships between young children’s theory of
mind and moral judgment have shown both dis-
tinctions and interrelations between moral and psy-
chological knowledge (Fu, Xiao, Killen, & Lee, 2014;
Killen, Mulvey, Richardson, Jampol, & Woodward,
2011; Smetana et al., 2012; Wainryb & Brehl, 2006).
In one of the ﬁrst systematic investigations of the
relation between false belief understanding in a
moral context and moral
judgment, Killen et al.
(2011) studied young children’s understanding of a
transgression that was committed accidentally, that
is, by an actor who was guided by positive inten-
tions but did unintended damage based on a false
belief.

child’s

Speciﬁcally,

contained another

the scenario developed by Killen
et al. (2011)
involved a story about a classroom
helper who threw out a paper bag when cleaning
up the classroom that, unbeknownst to the class-
room helper,
special
cupcake (the cupcake owner was outside of the
classroom when the classroom helper
threw it
away). Children found it more challenging to iden-
tify the accidental transgressor’s false belief (knowl-
edge about the contents of the paper bag) in the
morally relevant context than a neutral agent’s false
belief in a standard false belief task (knowledge
about the contents of a cracker box, e.g., the cray-
ons in the cracker box task, see Wellman & Liu,
2004). Furthermore, false belief understanding was
related to understanding the accidental transgres-
sor’s intentions. Children who failed to understand
that the transgressor falsely believed that the paper
bag was empty tended to mistakenly attribute neg-
ative intentions to the wrongdoer. But even many
5-year-olds who understood the accidental trans-
gressor’s false belief, answered that the transgressor
intended to commit a “bad” act, indicating that it
remains challenging for young children to under-
stand an actor’s intentions in a morally relevant
situation even once they have acquired an under-
standing of false belief.

intentional agency may be predictive of

Thus, the accidental transgressor paradigm by
Killen et al. (2011) assesses children’s understand-
ing of an actor’s intention, depending on their
understanding of the actor’s false belief, which is
critical for adequate moral judgment. We propose
that developmental precursors of an understanding
of
the
development of moral understanding in a context
requiring theory-of-mind competence. Theoretical
considerations and previous ﬁndings relating infant
action understanding to older children’s theory of
mind led us to examine whether infant action
understanding is predictive of intentional reasoning
necessary for moral judgment in early childhood.

On the basis of previous studies (Aschersleben
et al., 2008; Thoermer et al., 2012; Wellman et al.,
2008), we expected both goal encoding in the 1st
year of life and implicit false belief understanding
at 18 months to be predictive of morally relevant
theory of mind (MoToM). These predictions were
based on the proposition that infant psychological
reasoning is developmentally linked to children’s
later explicit understanding of
intentional states.
Goal encoding is foundational for an understanding
of intentional action and should therefore be related
to later explicit reasoning about agents’ intentions
in general and moral
in particular.

states,

in particular,

Implicit false belief understanding should be predic-
tive of later explicit reasoning about belief-based
intentional
the accidental
transgressor’s intentions.
An understanding of

intentionality not only
depends on the attribution of beliefs but also of
desires to an agent. Although there is evidence for
an implicit understanding of
the subjectivity of
desires in infancy (Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997), this
has, surprisingly, not been related to later explicit
theory of mind. Explicit desire reasoning at 3 years
was shown to be predictive of belief reasoning at
4 years in a longitudinal study by Wellman, Fang,
and Peterson (2011). To explore the predictive rela-
tions of implicit reasoning about desires in infancy
and later explicit theory of mind, we included an
assessment of subjective desire understanding at
24 months and predicted this measure to be related
to later reasoning about beliefs and belief-based
intentions. This is important not only for under-
standing the development of theory-of-mind com-
petence but also may provide evidence for future
research on links between subjective desires and
moral judgments.

A second aim of the present study was to con-
tribute to the intense debate about the nature of
early social cognition (e.g., Baillargeon et al., 2010;
Ruffman, 2014; Sodian, 2011; Uithol & Paulus, 2014;
Woodward, 2009) by investigating the interrelations
among different components of psychological rea-
soning in infancy. If infants’ responses to action
understanding tasks reﬂect relatively rich psycho-
logical knowledge, then we should not only expect
predictive long-term relations for later theory-of-
mind reasoning but also interrelations among the
infant measures. Because multimeasure and within-
subjects longitudinal studies in infancy are quite
rare, no prior study has examined the interrelations
among goal understanding, belief understanding,
and desire understanding in infancy. It is possible
that key components of an implicit theory of mind
develop independently in infancy,
jointly support-
ing the acquisition of mentalistic action understand-
ing and being integrated into a coherent set of
mental state concepts only in early childhood, when
an explicit theory of mind develops. Alternatively,
infants’
it is also possible that core elements of
understanding of
intentional action are develop-
mentally interrelated even in the 2nd year of life
and thus form an integrated system of action
prediction and action explanation even in infancy.

To test for goal, belief, and desire understanding
in infancy, we chose three tasks: goal encoding
assessed in a habituation paradigm (Woodward,

1224

Sodian et al.

1998) at the age of 7 months, false belief under-
standing assessed in an anticipatory looking task
(Thoermer et al., 2012) at the age of 18 months, and
an understanding of
the subjectivity of desires
(Repacholi & Gopnik, 1997) assessed at the age of
24 months. The age of 24 months was chosen
because Carlson, Mandell, and Williams (2004)
showed sufﬁcient variability in this task at this age.
These measures were taken from a larger longitudi-
nal study of theory of mind in infancy and early
childhood, which also comprised assessments of
joint attentional and imitation skills in infancy (e.g.,
Kristen, Sodian, Thoermer, & Perst, 2011; Paulus
et al., 2015; Sodian & Kristen-Antonow, 2015).

We chose looking-time measures of goal encod-
ing and false belief understanding because these
measures tap infants’ encoding of intentional action
independently of their engagement in social interac-
tion. For desire reasoning at 24 months, we used a
social-interactive measure because, to date, no look-
ing-time measure of this concept has been devel-
oped. To test for the speciﬁcity of the predictive
relations between infant social cognition and early
childhood theory of mind, verbal IQ (Wechsler Pre-
school and Primary Scale of Intelligence [WPPSI])
measured at the age of 48 months was used as a
control variable; a working memory measure
assessed at the age of 7 months was used as a con-
trol variable in infancy. To test for the connections
to moral judgment in early childhood, we adminis-
tered the MoToM interview by Killen et al. (2011),
which assessed understanding an accidental trans-
gressor’s false belief and his/her (positive) intention
at the age of 5 years. In sum, the present study is
the ﬁrst investigation of the relations among three
core components of theory of mind in infancy and
the connections between these forms of intentional
knowledge and attributions of moral intentions in
early childhood.

The full sample consisted of N = 77 (37 girls, 40
boys) healthy children who had participated in a
longitudinal study of social-cognitive development
from the age of 7 months, with at least one valid
data point in infancy and who produced valid data
at least one of the measurement points in early
childhood. Children were recruited from public
birth records and from middle-income backgrounds
in Southern Germany. Ages at the measurement

44.2% had a bachelor or a master degree, and 9.1%
had a PhD. Assessments were carried out in a uni-
versity laboratory in Germany (in German), and all
children were accompanied by a caretaker. Partici-

mittee approved the study.

Procedure and Measures

Goal-Encoding Task at 7 Months

Infants sat in a tabletop seat or on the parent’s
lap in front of a stage on which a stuffed bear and
a ball were placed on pedestals. In each trial, a cur-
tain opened, and a human hand and arm moved in
from the side and grasped one of
the objects,
remaining still until the trial ended and the curtain
closed. A trial
lasted until the baby had looked
away from the stage for two consecutive seconds.
For half (n = 21) of the infants, the toy on the right
was the target (respectively, for the other half, it
was the toy on the left). The habituation criterion
was established by summing up looking times over
the ﬁrst three trials that summed up to at least 12 s.
An infant reached the habituation criterion when
three trials totaled less than half of the sum of these
trials. If an infant did not reach this criterion, the
test
trials were begun after 14 trials. The mean
trials was M = 9.49
number
(SD = 3.42, range = 6–14). After habituation was
complete, the toys’ positions were switched and the
baby saw one familiarization trial with the toys in
their new positions.

of

After that,

the baby saw two alternating test
events with three trials of each type. In the old
goal/new path event, the actor grasped the same
toy as during habituation (the toy was in a new
position, so the actor moved his arm through a
new path to grasp the toy). In the new goal/old
path event, the actor moved her arm through the
same path as in habituation, grasping a new toy
(Woodward, 1998). Twenty-one infants began with
a new goal/old path trial, and 21 began with an
old goal/new path trial. The infants’ looking was

coded by an observer who pressed a key on a
computer keyboard when the infant looked at the
stage. From that,
looking times and habituation
criteria were calculated by a computer program
(Pinto, 1994). To assess reliability, a second obser-
ver coded each video again from the videotaped
record. Only infants for whom an interobserver
correlation of 0.9 or more was achieved were
included (see Licata et al., 2014,
for details on
inclusion criteria).

Working Memory at 7 Months

The infants sat on their caregiver’s lap facing a
frame containing two openings that were side by
side, 42 cm apart from center to center. Two cur-
tains were attached to the back of
the frame,
designed to cover the windows. At the beginning
of each trial,
the experimenter pulled aside two
curtains, put her face in one of the windows, and
engaged the infant’s attention. Then,
the experi-
menter withdrew her face, replaced the two cur-
tains, and wiggled her ﬁngers at the top center of
the frame. As soon as the infant looked toward the
ﬁngers,
the experimenter reopened the curtains,
and after a 2- to 3-s pause, she reappeared in her
previous location. The curtains were then closed
again. After a short pause, the curtains were reo-
pened to initiate the next trial. The experimenter’s
location of appearance was counterbalanced across
trials between the left and right windows, and the
procedure lasted for six trials (in contrast to 12 tri-
als in the original procedure, see Reznick, Morrow,
Goldman, & Snyder, 2004).

Videotapes were coded by two independent
coders who assessed the direction of the infant’s
ﬁrst gaze after the reopening of the curtain. Chil-
dren were given a score of 1 if they looked toward
the cued direction and a score of 0 if their gaze was
directed toward some other location. Scores, thus,
could range from 0 to 6. A random sample of 25%

children was coded by a second observer. Cohen’s
kappa was .72.

Belief-Based Anticipatory Looking (Implicit False Belief)
Task at 18 Months

Infants’

implicit false belief understanding was
tested using a task adapted from Neumann, Thoer-
mer, and Sodian (2008). Infants watched animated
movies on screen with an integrated eye-tracking
system (for a more detailed description, as well as
inclusion criteria, see Thoermer et al., 2012). The
movies showed a female agent watching a car
moving from one garage to another (see Figure 1).
During familiarization (two trials for each child,
each lasting 32 s), once the actor had seen the car
arrive at the second box, she disappeared behind a
screen. Subsequently, two doors above each of the
two boxes were illuminated (accompanied by a
chime). This was followed by a freeze frame of 3 s
during which anticipatory ﬁxations at
the two
doors (areas of interest [AOI]) were assessed. Then
the agent’s face appeared at one of the doors and
she reached through this door for the car. Infants
subsequently received one test trial. Test trials (last-
ing 41 s) differed from familiarization in that a
phone ring distracted the actor from observing the
car, while the car continued to move; after reaching
the second garage,
it went backward to the ﬁrst
garage and then went on driving through the gar-
age, disappearing from the screen. Once the car
exited the screen, the doors illuminated with an
accompanying chime and infants’ ﬁxations were
recorded over a 3-s anticipatory period. Figure 1
shows the timeline for the test event of this belief-
based anticipatory looking task (see Figure 1).

Diverse Desire Reasoning at 24 Months

Desire reasoning was measured using a task
based on Repacholi and Gopnik (1997). Children

were seated at a table at the opposite side of the
experimenter. In a warm-up phase, a give-and-take
play with a block was played for about 30 s to
check whether children were motivated to give an
object to another person. After that, the child was
presented a car and a block on a tray. The side of
the object (i.e., whether the car or the block was
presented on the right or on the left side) was ran-
domized. The child had 45 s in which to explore
the objects. Then, the objects were removed and the
experimenter held the object in her hand, looked at
it and said, using expressions of disgust for the
object the child had preferred during the explo-
ration phase, Yuck a block/car.
I played with the
block/car. Ugh. I don’t like blocks/cars. Yuck, this state-
ment lasted for 10 s. After that, the experimenter
showed preference for the other object by showing
facial expressions of happiness (Ahhh a block/car, I
love blocks/cars! Yay!),
played with the block/car!
again lasting for 10 s. Then the experimenter put
both objects again into the bowls on a tray, moved
the tray toward the child, put his hand in the mid-
dle of the two bowls with palms up, and asked,
Can you give me something? Coding was done by
two research assistants, one of them coding 100%
of the sample and the other coding 30% of the sam-
ple. Children received a “1” if they gave the correct,
that is, the item the experimenter had preferred, to
the experimenter, and a “0” if they gave the item
they preferred themselves
to the experimenter.
Cohen’s kappa was j = .92.

Verbal IQ at 48 Months

The verbal IQ at 48 months was assessed by
administering two subtests of the German version
of WPPSI (Petermann, 2009) verbal IQ scale, Simi-
larities and General Knowledge. Both tasks were
administered according to the testing manual. The
subtest Similarities assesses verbal reasoning and
concept formation. The child read an incomplete
sentence containing two concepts that share a com-
mon characteristic, such as Dogs and cats, both are
. . .? The child’s task was to complete the sentences
by stating a shared property or superordinate con-
cept. In the General Knowledge task, the child had
to answer questions relating to general knowledge
topics (e.g., “Which animals do you know?,” “What
is the opposite of south?”).

of the present study, two assessments pertaining to
the “MoToM” story were administered:
(a) false
belief (false contents) in a morally relevant context
and (b) attributions of moral intentions of an acci-
dental transgressor. In a short warm-up task, chil-
dren were familiarized with the Likert-type scale
(1 = not a lot; 4 = a lot) by asking them two short
questions (how much they liked pizza and how
much they liked playing outside) and asking them
to show it on the child friendly (smiley faces)
Likert-type scale.

Children were told a short story involving one
child, a classroom helper, who cleaned up the room
and accidentally threw away a paper bag on a table
that had another child’s cupcake inside (the owner
of the cupcake was playing outside). Brightly illus-
trated pictures of the characters and objects (cup-
cake, trash can) were used during the interview for
ease of following the story (see Killen et al., 2011).
The exact story was the following (gender names
matched the gender of the participant):

This is Max/Tina (pointing to Max/Tina) and
this is Tom/Julia (pointing to Tom/Julia). Max
has brought
in a cupcake from home and is
keeping it in this paper bag. Max puts the paper
bag on the table then goes outside to play. Tim
is helping the teacher clean up the classroom and
sees the paper bag. Tim throws the paper bag in
the trash.

The assessments were (a) false belief (false con-
tents) of the accidental transgressor (What did Tim,
the boy who threw out the paper bag, think was in the
bag?: cupcake or trash) and (b) attributions of moral
intentions of the accidental transgressor (When Tim
threw out the bag, did he think he was doing something
that was all right or not all right?: Likert-type scale
response). Coding was done by two research assis-
tants, one of them coding 100% of the sample, and
the other coding 30% of the sample. Cohen’s kappa
was j = 1.0 in the false belief question and j = .96
in the question regarding the attributions of moral
intentions of the actor.

dividing the total amount of looking time at the
new goal event by the sum of the looking times at
the new goal event plus the new path event (see
Table 1).

Implicit False Belief Task

A proportion score of looking at the correct (i.e.,
belief based) door AOI (i.e., the door in the wall at
which the agent would be expected to search based
on his belief about the car’s location) was calculated
by dividing the time an infant spent looking at the
correct AOI by the sum of looking at the correct
door AOI and the incorrect door AOI, and multi-
plying the quotient by 100. Results showed that
infants spent M = 57% of the time looking at the
belief-based door.

Inferential Analyses

We ﬁrst report bivariate correlations among the
focal variables (see Table 2), followed by nonpara-
metric analyses. In a second step, we test for the
speciﬁcity of
the hypothesized longitudinal rela-
tions by means of partial correlations.

We predicted measures of infant psychological
reasoning to be signiﬁcantly correlated with both
intention and false belief understanding in the
moral theory-of-mind (MoToM) interview. Conﬁrm-
ing our hypotheses, infants’ goal-encoding ability at
7 months (differentiation between test trials) was
positively related to children’s moral
intention
understanding at 60 months. Moreover,
implicit
false belief understanding assessed at 18 months
was also positively related to children’s attributions
of moral
intentions at 60 months. Desire under-
standing at 24 months was not correlated with
moral intention understanding, but it was positively
related to children’s understanding of the accidental
transgressor’s false belief. Contrary to expectations,
neither goal encoding nor
false belief
understanding was correlated with the MoToM
false belief question. Child gender was related to
performance on the MoToM interview, with girls
outperforming boys. Furthermore, verbal IQ was
positively correlated with almost all the assessed
variables (see Table 2).

implicit

We further aimed at investigating the interrela-
tions among different measures of infant psycholog-
ical reasoning. There was a marginally signiﬁcant
correlation between infants’ goal-encoding ability at
7 months and their implicit false belief competence
11 months later (see Table 2).

The ﬁndings on predictive relations between
infant social understanding and later understanding
of moral intentions were conﬁrmed by nonparamet-
ric analyses using one-tailed signiﬁcance tests.

score of 0.50 or less in the goal-encoding task mas-

judgment. While previous studies have shown goal
encoding and false belief understanding in infancy
to be predictive of later explicit false belief under-
standing, no prior research has demonstrated con-
nections to moral judgments in a context requiring
theory-of-mind competence. Infants who encoded
an agent’s actions in terms of their goals at the age
of 7 months, and who correctly anticipated an
agent’s
at
18 months, were more likely than infants who
failed these tasks to evaluate an accidental trans-
gressor’s intentions as positive at the age of 5 years.
Furthermore, 2-year-olds who understood the sub-
jectivity of desires were more likely than those who
failed this task to understand the accidental trans-
gressor’s false belief at the age of 5 years. The cor-
relations between infants’ and children’s reasoning
about agents’ intentions and beliefs were indepen-
dent of gender and general cognitive abilities as
assessed by verbal IQ.

actions

This pattern of ﬁndings was largely consistent
with our hypotheses which were based on previous
longitudinal studies of the relation between infant
psychological reasoning and preschool
theory of
mind. Note, however, that we did not ﬁnd signiﬁ-
cant correlations between goal-encoding and impli-
cit false belief understanding on one hand, and the
explicit false belief measure in the morally relevant
context on the other hand. This may be due to the
difﬁculty of the MoToM false belief task which may
involve additional task demands (see Killen et al.,
2011). Further research is necessary to determine
the relation between the standard false belief assess-
ment and false belief understanding in a morally
relevant context.

Our main predictions, concerning the relation
between infant understanding of intentional action
and later
intentional understanding in a moral

When the correlations between infant measures
and the MoToM moral
intentions question were
controlled for gender and verbal IQ, they proved to
be stable, using one-tailed signiﬁcance tests. Implicit
false belief and moral intention understanding were
signiﬁcantly correlated, rpar(33) = .35, p = .021, and
so were goal encoding and moral intention under-
standing, rpar(30) = .32, p = .038. For the dichoto-
mous scores on the diverse desires and MoToM
false belief tasks, no partial correlation could be
computed. Instead, a binary logistic regression anal-
ysis using the forward (Wald) option yielded a sig-
niﬁcant effect of both children’s competence in the

belief understanding,
indicating that the effect of
the diverse desires task remained signiﬁcant when
IQ was taken into account. With regard to the cor-
relations among the infancy measures, the relation

Inferring an agent’s intention independently of the
outcome of his or her actions is a key component of
moral
judgment and psychological understanding
in general. The types of errors that children make
when they do not have MoToM contribute to peer
conﬂict and social tension in social development,
blaming an accidental transgressor for wrong-doing
is one of the most frequent sources of conﬂict in
social encounters, and particularly in early child-
hood (Killen & Smetana, 2015). The present ﬁndings
indicate that these core aspects of real-world social
understanding in early childhood have their roots
in infant action understanding.

that an understanding of intentional agency is cen-

investigate relationships between goal encoding in
infancy and competencies that
reﬂect an early
awareness of fair or just treatment of others (moral-
ity) in infancy, such as response to others’ distress
(Hastings, Miller, Kahle, & Zahn-Waxler, 2014) or
preferences for prosocial acts over harmful acts
(Hamlin, 2013). It should also be noted that the con-
clusions to be drawn from the present study are
limited due to design and sample size. The present
ﬁndings justify a next step which would be a pro-
ject with a larger scope, designed to model patterns
of developmental change.

development and may be interrelated, beginning in
infancy.

Regarding the implications for theory-of-mind
development, the present study is the ﬁrst one to
demonstrate a link between goal encoding and
implicit false belief understanding in infancy, and
later explicit understanding of intentions. Both goal

false belief understanding

take his epistemic state into account. Moreover, the
study demonstrated a predictive relation between
desire understanding in a nonverbal
task at
24 months, and explicit false belief understanding
at the age of 5 years. This ﬁnding is consistent with
longitudinal relations from desire to belief reason-
ing shown between 3 and 4 years by Wellman et al.
(2011). Thus, the present pattern of ﬁndings goes
beyond previous studies in demonstrating a net-
work of relations between different components of
psychological reasoning in infancy and theory of
mind in early childhood.

Furthermore, the present study demonstrated a
correlation between goal encoding at 7 months and
implicit
false belief understanding at 18 months
which was independent of working memory. This
ﬁnding is consistent with the idea that infants’ early
ability to analyze actions in terms of goals is foun-
dational for their later developing ability to take
epistemic
into account when predicting
agents’ goal-directed action, and tentatively sup-
ports the view of conceptual coherence in infants’
mentalistic action understanding rather than the
idea of independent core knowledge components
(Carey, 2009).

states

Taken together, the present ﬁndings lend some
ﬁrst support to a conceptual interpretation of infants’
agent and action representations which are interre-
lated in infancy, and linked to later mental state attri-
butions. While previous ﬁndings on the relation
between implicit and explicit false belief understand-
ing (Thoermer et al., 2012) were interpretable in
terms of task features, the present ﬁndings are clearly
not due to similarity in task features, and go beyond
the level of relations between analogous concepts.
Rather, goal understanding predicted later (implicit)
belief understanding and both were predictive of
explicit moral intention understanding in a task that
required the child to take an agent’s epistemic state
into account. Moreover, early desire understanding
predicted later belief understanding, adding to the
picture of conceptual coherence between earlier and
later developing components of psychological rea-
soning. Note that these ﬁndings speak against low-
level interpretations of infant theory-of-mind compe-
tencies in terms of responses to perceptual novelty
(Heyes, 2014).

A conceptual

interpretation of

infants’ under-
standing of intentional agency does not, however,
necessarily imply that infants have an understand-
ing of intentional states in the sense of a representa-
tional theory of mind (Sodian, 2011). Rather, the
ability to keep track of what an agent perceived
(experiential record, Perner & Roessler, 2012), and

1230

Sodian et al.

to integrate this information with a representation
of the agent’s goals may be sufﬁcient to arrive at
belief-consistent action predictions. Thus, a prefer-
ential sensitivity in infants to an agent’s attention
focus and goal in the face of conﬂicting or salient
irrelevant information may be related to later expli-
cit attention to an agent’s mental state even when
this mental state conﬂicts with the overt outcome of
his action. Goal encoding in infancy requires a
speciﬁc deployment of attention to an agent’s goals
and attention focus over and above a novel spa-
tiotemporal feature of the action (for discussions
see Paulus, 2012; Thoermer, Woodward, Sodian,
Perst, & Kristen, 2013). In the anticipatory looking
task, as well, infants have to pay attention to and
draw inferences from a change in an agent’s atten-
tion focus in the context of a goal-directed action
(the protagonist is distracted from observing the
critical event by a phone ringing). And ﬁnally, the
intention question in the MoToM task requires chil-
dren to take the transgressor’s epistemic state into
account when drawing an inference about his inten-
tion, independently of the negative valence of the
outcome of his action.

Understanding intentional agency in infancy is
related to intentionality necessary for making accu-
rate moral
judgments in a complex situation in
childhood, one that requires attributions of inten-
tional agents for making a moral judgment. When
intentionality judgments are correct then children
do not blame a potential transgressor for a mis-
deed; when intentionality judgments are mistaken
(an error of theory of mind) then blame is assigned
to accidental
(Killen et al., 2011).
These data support the viewpoint that intentionality
attributions determine the moral status of the trans-
gression. Thus,
relationship
between intention understanding in infancy and
later intentionality required for moral
judgment
highlights the central role of intentional agency to
social
relationships, and the
components necessary for the healthy functioning
of children’s cognitive, social, and moral develop-
ment.
