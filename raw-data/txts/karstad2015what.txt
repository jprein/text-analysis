We studied potential determinants of
the development of children’s emotion
understanding (EU) from age 4 to 6 in a Norwegian community sample (N = 974) using
the Test of Emotion Comprehension. Interpersonal predictors included the accuracy of
parental mentalization, parental emotional availability, and teacher-reported child social
skills. Intrapersonal child factors were child gender and verbal skills. Overall, children’s EU
increased signiﬁcantly over time. After adjusting for child gender, age-4 EU, and parental
socio-economic status, greater child verbal and social skills and greater parental
mentalization each uniquely predicted growth in EU. Results are discussed in terms of
theory and research on children’s EU and parents’ emotion socialization.

Emotion understanding (EU), which refers to one’s ability to know the feelings of others
and oneself, is essential for competent social functioning and psychological well-being
(de Rosnay, Harris, & Pons, 2008). Models describing the development of EU
(Halberstadt, Denham, & Dunsmore, 2001; Pons, Harris, & de Rosnay, 2004; Saarni,
1999) highlight several components of EU, from labelling and identifying emotion-
eliciting situations to understanding more complex sentiments such as ambivalence and
moral emotions. Past research documents links between EU and a variety of positive
developmental outcomes, including secure attachment (Fonagy & Target, 1997; Raikes
& Thompson, 2008; de Rosnay & Harris, 2002), social competence (Denham, 2006;
Dunn & Cutting, 1999), and language skills (Pons, Lawson, Harris, & de Rosnay, 2003).
Preschool children who are better at identifying emotions in others also have fewer
behaviour problems (Hughes, Dunn, & White, 1998). Delayed development of and
limitations in EU are associated, in contrast, with mental disorders (for review, see
Southam-Gerow & Kendall, 2002).

Predictors of emotion understanding

341

Although children’s EU, on average, advances considerably from age 2 years to middle
childhood (Hughes & Dunn, 1998; Nelson et al., 2012; Ontai & Thompson, 2002),
substantial individual differences in EU exist among children (Harris, 2000; Pons & Harris,
2005). Why do some children excel in EU at an early age whereas others exhibit more
limited development? This is the primary question addressed in this report.

Intervention research makes clear that direct training of preschoolers (Domitrovich,
Cortes, & Greenberg, 2007; Gavazzi & Ornaghi, 2011) and school-age children (Ornaghi,
Brockmeier, & Grazzani, 2014; Tenenbaum, Alﬁeri, Brooks, & Dunne, 2008) enhances
children’s EU. Such speciﬁc and targeted EU training is not the primary means by which
EU development is facilitated in most children. As noted by Denham (1998), interpersonal
and intrapersonal factors are the primary drivers of EU development in the lives of most
children, so it is these that are the foci of this enquiry.

Interpersonal predictors
Regarding interpersonal factors, emotion socialization starts in the family in the early
preschool years and is later supplemented by preschool teachers and peers. Children’s
interactions and relationships with other people, including their peers, are thought to be
the primary means through which children learn about and practise their EU skills.
Therefore, in the present enquiry, we focus on interpersonal factors, speciﬁcally parents’
mentalizing ability (in ‘reading’ their child’s mind), their non-hostile, sensitive parenting,
and children’s social skills. We regard the latter as an interpersonal factor because the
social skills’ measure use herein – the Social Skills Rating System (SSRS; Gresham & Elliot,
1990) – mostly taps children’s behaviour directed towards peers. We acknowledge that
the targeted interpersonal predictors are not extensive and, most notably, exclude
important aspects of emotion socialization, perhaps most especially parents’ explicit
discussion of emotion with their children (Aznar & Tenenbaum, 2013; Dunn, Brown, &
Beardsall, 1991; Farrant, Maybery, & Fletcher, 2013).

Parental emotional availability
Parents’ emotional resources are likely to inﬂuence their children’s EU and its
development. The emotion socialization literature highlights the inﬂuence of parents’
ability to accept and help children experience both negative and positive emotions on
children’s emotional development. Having parents who name and value all types of
emotions and who create an emotional climate in which a child’s emotions are addressed
in a sensitive and non-hostile way is hypothesized to help the child learn about his or her
own and other people’s emotions (e.g., Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998).
Empirically, the importance of the emotional quality of the parent–child interaction for
the development of EU has received some support in cross-sectional research (Denham &
Grout, 1993; Denham, Mitchell-Copeland, Strandberg, Auerbach, & Blair, 1997) and
longitudinal studies (Denham, Zoller, & Couchoud, 1994). For example, Denham and
Kochanoff (2002) reported that children’s EU at ages 3 and 4 was predicted by mothers’
positive observed emotions, attentiveness to their children’s emotions, and willingness to
help their children address their emotions. Unfortunately, it is not clear from such work
whether the association reﬂects parent or child effects (or some other source of
inﬂuence). Thus, we extend previous enquiry using repeated-measurements of EU to test
the proposition that greater parental emotional availability measured at age 4 predicts
increased EU from age 4 to 6.

Accuracy of parental mentalization
Parents’ ability to value and understand their children’s emotions and thoughts inﬂuences
the children’s socio-emotional development (Sharp & Fonagy, 2008). Concepts such as
mind-mindedness (Meins et al., 2003), reﬂective function (Fonagy & Target, 1997),
meta-emotion philosophy (Gottman, Katz, & Hooven, 1996), insightfulness (Oppen-
heim & Koren-Karie, 2013), and the accuracy of parental mentalization (Sharp, Fonagy,
& Goodyer, 2006) all refer to an individual’s ability to value and understand another
person’s emotions and thoughts. Fonagy and Target (1997) argue that children’s
mentalization abilities develop within emotionally charged relationships, while contend-
ing that the effect of parental mentalization is mediated via parental behaviour (e.g.,
parental emotion talk, social interactions during play).

Cross-sectional evidence indicates that mothers who describe their 4- to 6-year-old
children in more mentalistic terms have children with more advanced EU (de Rosnay,
Pons, Harris, & Morrell, 2004). Due to problems inherent in interpreting such cross-
sectional associations, here we rely on a longitudinal design that affords testing the
prediction that the greater a parent’s ability to take his or her child’s perspective, the more
the child’s EU will increase over time. Evidence consistent with this hypothesis would
extend ﬁndings from a small sample study (n = 33) by Meins, Fernyhough, Russell, and
Clark-Carter (1998) showing that greater use of mentalizing language by mothers of 3-year-
olds predicted greater child EU 2 years later. Instead of relying on a mentalizing measure
based on mothers’ verbal description and analysis of videotaped interactions with their
children, we developed a measure of the accuracy of parental mentalization, following
Sharp et al. (2006), that involves a direct comparison of the child’s actual performance on
a test of EU with the parent’s estimate of child performance on a test of EU.

Child social skills
Banerjee, Watling, and Caputi (2011) observed that a speciﬁc component of EU, namely
false belief understanding, emerges between 3 and 5 years of age, the development of
which coincides with a dramatic increase in peer interaction. Indeed, having more
friends and being well liked by peers and teachers, capabilities that are inﬂuenced by and
inﬂuence social skills are positively related to EU (Denham, 1986; Denham, McKinley,
Couchoud, & Holt, 1990; Denham et al., 2003). Indeed, some contend that advanced EU
predicts advanced social skills (Denham et al., 2003; Garner & Estep, 2001). Of course,
the reverse process of inﬂuence also seems possible, such that more and higher quality
peer interactions enable children to practise and further develop their emotional and
social skills (Banerjee et al., 2011). Consistent with this claim, Maguire and Dunn (1997)
found that children (N = 41) displaying high complexity of social play at 69 months
evinced greater understanding of mixed emotions at 7 months later. Similarly,
Dunsmore and Karn (2004) measured peer relationships and EU on two occasions
across a 6-month period, from age 5.5 to 6 years (N = 45), observing that popular
children and children with more stable friendships manifested greater growth in EU than
other children. Once again, the modest sample sizes raise questions about the
replicability and generalizability of the ﬁndings, as does the study’s failure to evaluate
other interpersonal factors known to be related to EU simultaneously. Nevertheless,
consistent with the ﬁndings summarized above, we hypothesize that child social skills at
4 years of age will predict increased child EU from 4 to 6 years, even after controlling for
other intra- and interpersonal variables.

Intrapersonal and demographic factors
Intrapersonal factors included in this report, along with family demographic factors, will
serve as covariates in the multivariate analyses to be reported – so that the unique effects of
the interpersonal factors already mentioned can be estimated. The covariates have been
selected based on prior work showing them to be related to either EU or the interpersonal
predictors of EU considered in this enquiry. They include children’s gender (Root &
Denham, 2010) and verbal skills (Cutting & Dunn, 1999; Pons et al., 2003; de Rosnay &
Harris, 2002; de Rosnay et al., 2004), as well as parental socio-economic status (SES;
Cutting & Dunn, 1999; Dunn & Brown, 1994).

The present study

1. The present study is the largest population study to investigate EU development over
time. In this study, we included interpersonal predictors while controlling for
intrapersonal covariates, and we used the same instrument at both time points. Based
on prior research, our initial hypotheses were as follows:

2. Parental emotional availability and the accuracy of parents’ mentalization measured
when their child was 4 years predict an increase in children’s EU measured at age 6.
In addition, more mature social skills in children measured at age 4 also predict an
increase in children’s EU measured at age 6.

Method

Participants and procedure
A letter of invitation was sent to all parents of two birth cohorts of children in a city in mid-
Norway (approximately 200,000 inhabitants). To increase the variability in EU (and other
measured constructs) in an age-restricted sample, we oversampled for children with
social, emotional, and behavioural problems, using the Strengths and Difﬁculties
Questionnaire (SDQ; Goodman, 1997) as a screening instrument in sample selection
and recruitment. The SDQ is an efﬁcient screening for mental-health problems in
preschoolers (Sveen, Berg-Nielsen, Lydersen, & Wichstrøm, 2013), which are known to
correlate with EU (Southam-Gerow & Kendall, 2002). Details about the procedure and
recruitment have been presented elsewhere (Wichstrøm et al., 2012); thus, only a brief
outline is provided here.

The parents brought the completed SDQ to the community health check-up
appointment that is routinely scheduled for all Norwegian 4-year-olds. Of the parents
who were eligible for the study, 97.2% showed up for their appointments at one of the
city’s well-child clinics. Parents who were not sufﬁciently proﬁcient in Norwegian to
complete the SDQ screen were excluded from the study. A nurse at the clinic informed the
parents about the study using procedures and measures approved by the Regional
Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics and then obtained written consent
from the parents to participate in the study. A small percentage of the families (5.2%) were
not asked to participate because of an error on the part of the clinic staff.

The SDQ is a 31-item measure that has been demonstrated to have an excellent
screening ability for psychiatric symptoms among preschoolers (Sveen et al., 2013). SDQ
scores on the symptom scale (20 items) were divided into four strata: 0–4, 5–8, 9–11, and
12–40. With a random number generator, deﬁned proportions of parents in each stratum
(.37, .48, .70, and .89, respectively) were drawn for participation in further studies. The

344

Silja B. Karstad et al.

sample was adjusted for stratiﬁcation in all analyses. The dropout rate after consenting at
the well-child clinic did not differ across the four SDQ strata (v2 = 5.70, df = 3, NS) or
gender (v2 = 0.23, df = 1, NS).

Because of child fatigue and missing data from the parents, the analysis sample for this
study consisted of 926 parent–child dyads in the ﬁrst assessment (T1), with 464 boys and
462 girls who completed the TEC. The mean age of the children at T1 was 4.4 years (range
3.85–5.36, SD = 0.18). Nearly every caretaker attending the clinic with their child
(M = 35.1 years, SD = 5.0) was the child’s biological parent (99.5%), was married or had
lived with their partner for more than 6 months (87.6%), and was a woman (84.4%). Both
mothers (95.8%) and fathers (94.2%) were of primarily Norwegian ancestry. After the
sample was adjusted for stratiﬁcation, the sample was compared to register information
from Statistics Norway on the parents of all 4-year-olds in the mid-Norway city in 2007 and
2008. The sample contained a higher proportion of divorced parents (7.6%) compared
with the population as a whole (2.1%), whereas the level of parental education was
virtually identical across the sample and population. Consequently, the sample is
considered a representative community sample.

In total, 756 children reassessed after 2.4 years (T2), when each child had started ﬁrst
grade (M = 6.7 years, range = 6.0–7.7, SD = 0.16), had usable TEC scores. Among these
children, 48 did not provide usable TEC scores when they were 4 years old. Thus, 974
children had usable TEC measures at either 4 or 6 years and formed the analysis sample.
None of the study variables proved signiﬁcant in predicting attrition.

Children were tested at the clinic without their parents present, and parents granted
consent to mail a questionnaire to the childcare provider who knew the child best in the
day care centre they were attending. While the child watched a movie in the same room as
their parent while wearing headphones, the parent was asked to estimate their children’s
EU. Parent–child interaction was then videotaped for 30 min across ﬁve tasks (Eyberg,
McDiarmid, Duke, & Boggs, 2005): Free play (10 min), child-guided play (5), parent-
guided play (5), clean-up (max: 5), and child-waiting (i.e., not interacting with the parent)
while the parent answered a questionnaire (5).

Measures

Emotion understanding
Emotion understanding was assessed using a Norwegian translation (by the ﬁrst author,
with proofreading by bilingual scholars) of the TEC (Pons & Harris, 2000) at T1 and T2.
The TEC is designed for children aged 3–11 years and is composed of nine components.
The nine components are described in Table 1, divided into three developmental periods
suggested by Pons et al. (2004). The TEC has been widely used in research around the
world and has been translated to 18 languages (Albanese et al., 2006; Pons & Harris, 2005;
Tenenbaum, Visscher, Pons, & Harris, 2004).

A short story accompanied by cartoon scenarios was read aloud to the child while the
‘faces’ of the cartoon characters were presented without any feature or expression (i.e., a
blank circle). At the story’s end, the child was asked to indicate the emotional response of
the story’s protagonist by pointing to one of the four cartoon faces expressing different
emotions presented for this purpose, two displaying negative emotions (sad, scared; sad,
angry; or scared, angry) and two non-negative emotions (happy, just alright). Practice
questions are administered before test questions to conﬁrm children’s comprehension of
the procedure. The TEC has separate versions for girls and boys, and administration lasted
for approximately 15–20 min.

The components increase in difﬁculty and yield a sum score (range: 0–9), with a score
of 0 or 1 at each component level. Recognition (component 1) and External cause
(component 2) are assessed with ﬁve test items, and at least four of the ﬁve items must be
answered to obtain score of 1. Desire (component 3) is assessed with four test items (4/4
must be answered correctly to obtain score of 1), whereas Belief (component 4),
Reminder (component 5), Regulation (component 6), Hiding (component 7), and Mixed
(component 8) consist of one test item each. Morality (component 9) is assessed with two
items, and both must be answered to obtain score of 1. For a more detailed description of
the TEC, see Pons et al. (2004).

The theta test was used to assess the reliability; it accounts for the categorical ordering
of the data (Zumbo, Gadermann, & Zeisser, 2007) and overcomes some limits of
Cronbach’s alpha (Gadermann, Guhn, & Zumbo, 2008). The theta for the TEC was .82 at
T1 and .91 at T2.

Interpersonal predictors

Parental emotional availability
This predictor was assessed with the EA Scales, 3rd ed. (Biringen, Robinson, & Emde,
1998). Parent and child interactions were videotaped at T1. The EA scales are used to rate
four parental dimensions (sensitivity, structuring, non-intrusiveness, and non-hostility)
and two child dimensions (responsiveness to and involvement with the parent). All
dimensions are assessed in the context of the dyadic interaction, instead of being speciﬁc
to the behaviour of an individual child or parent; however, we used the sum total of the
four parent ratings, as the four parent ratings yielded an internally consistent score in our
sample (a = .74). All raters were trained and certiﬁed as reliable by Z. Biringen, who
developed the EA. The inter-rater reliability between multiple blinded coders on a random
10% sample of the videotapes for the total parent scale was ICC = .71.

The accuracy of parental mentalization
This parental accuracy measure regarding children’s EU was assessed at T1 using a method
described by Sharp et al. (2006). Therefore, we ﬁrst tested the child alone, and the parent
was then instructed to provide responses to the TEC as if they were their child. The
accuracy of parental mentalization reﬂects the item-by-item correspondence between the
parent’s estimate and the child’s actual response to each question on the TEC (range:
0–21). Because the accuracy of parental mentalization measure captures the agreement
between parents and children without considering the actual correctness of the child’s
response, we chose to use all the items instead of the total score (0–9) because the total
scores include scoring rules that depend on the correctness of the answer. This approach
avoided the possibility of a parent generating an estimation score that exactly matched
that of the child (e.g., 3/9) but incorrectly estimating all of the child’s individual responses.
Because parental accuracy is a difference score on the item level whereas the child’s TEC
score represents the level across items, the two measures are conceptually independent.

Child social skills
This predictor was assessed by the total score of the 30-item Social Skills Rating System-
teacher report (SSRS-T) (Gresham & Elliot, 1990) at T1 (a = .93). The SSRS-T was
completed at T1 by the preschool teacher who was best acquainted with the child.

Intrapersonal and demographic factors

Verbal skills
The Norwegian version of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-III) (L. M. Dunn &
Dunn, 1997) was used to measure the children’s receptive language ability at T1. The
examiner presented a word that described one of four pictures on a page and asked the
child to point to or say the number of the picture corresponding to the word. The test
consisted of four practice items and 204 test items arranged in order of difﬁculty (a = .98).

Parental SES
In addition to the child’s gender, parental SES was included as a covariate. Parental
occupational status was used as a proxy for SES. The parent who completed the parent
version of the TEC was interviewed about her/his occupation. Parental occupational data
were coded according to the International Classiﬁcations of Occupations (International
Labour Ofﬁce, 1990), yielding the following categories: Unskilled workers, farmers/
ﬁshermen, skilled workers,
lower professionals, higher professionals, and leaders.
Because parental mentalization and parent–child interactions might covary with each
individual’s SES, we used the informant parent’s SES rather than both parents’ SES.

Results
Descriptive analyses are presented ﬁrst, followed by the primary prediction analysis of
development of EU from 4 to 6 years. Because we oversampled for mental-health
problems, analyses were performed with weights inversely proportional to the drawing
probability (i.e., the results for children with high scores on the SDQ were weighted
down, and the results for children with low scores on the SDQ were weighted up).

Predictors of emotion understanding

347

Moreover, a robust maximum-likelihood estimator was used, which yields robust standard
errors. Participants were included if they had usable scores on EU at T1 or T2 (n = 974).
Missing data were handled according to a full information maximum-likelihood procedure
using Mplus 7.2 (Muthen & Muthen, 1998–2013). These corrections were performed for
all analyses, thereby enabling us to generalize the ﬁndings to the larger population from
which the study sample was drawn.

Descriptive analyses
Two sets of analyses involving the mean EU and correlations are presented. Table 2 lists
the descriptive statistics for all the study variables. At 4 years, the mean EU score was MEU
4 years = 3.36, SD = 1.54. This score almost doubled by T2, MEU 6 years = 5.92, SD = 1.43.
To examine the development of EU over time, a growth modelling approach was used. To
accommodate growth with only two measurement points, the error terms of EU were set
to zero. Growth was parameterized as yearly change. Mgrowth was 1.28, p < .001. Because
such a change could partly result from altered importance of TEC items as the child grows,
measurement invariance was evaluated. The factor loadings of the individual TEC
components were examined by the model test procedure in Mplus. None of the factor
loadings differed at age 4 and 6 years (i.e., all p-values > .10). Figure 1 depicts the
percentage of children who correctly completed the EU components at T1 and T2. As the
ﬁgure shows, the distribution was not truncated at either end of the continuum; therefore,
the measurement did not suffer from any major ﬂoor and ceiling effects. The overall TEC
score improved for most children (84.9%) from T1 to T2, whereas the score did not
change for 8.8% of children and declined for 6.3% of children.

Table 3 presents the correlations among all the study variables, showing that EU scores
at T1 and T2 were modestly positively correlated. Additionally, greater verbal skills and
parental mentalization (measured at T1) were related to better EU, with associations larger

at T1 than at T2; greater parental emotional availability was associated with higher EU at
T1; and better social skills (measured at T1) were related to better EU at T2.

Prediction of growth in EU from T1 to T2
To test predictors of growth in EU, the growth parameters of growth and intercept (EU at
T1) were regressed on parental mentalization and emotional availability, child social and
verbal skills as well as gender and parental SES. These predictors were allowed to
correlate. To adjust for potential regression towards the mean effects (e.g., some children
could obtain high scores simply by chance by pointing to the correct answers), the slope

Predictors of emotion understanding

349

was regressed on the intercept. Parental mentalization, parental emotional availability,
and child social skills were measured as latent variables. Because parental mentalization
items were dichotomous (right or wrong), they were treated as categorical variables.
However, this approach resulted in a frequency table for the latent class indicator model
that was too large for Mplus to handle, so the chi-square could not be computed. Thus,
common model ﬁt indices (e.g., v2, RMSEA, CFI, and TLI) could not be computed.
Analysing the model without parental mentalization could provide an indication of model
the full model, and this proved satisfactory: v2(38) = 111.04, p < .001,
ﬁt of
RMSEA = .044, CFI = .972, TLI = .954, SRMR = .024.

Results are presented in Table 4. Greater parental accuracy of mentalization (T1) was
associated with larger EU intercept at T1. More importantly, greater parental accuracy
predicted a larger increase in EU over time (i.e., slope), as did better verbal and social skills.
As expected when regression towards the mean is at play and as often found in research
applying growth curves, the intercept strongly predicted reduced growth. Efforts to
determine whether effects of parental mentalization were moderated by levels of verbal
skills, social skills, and parental emotional availability revealed no signiﬁcant interaction
effects.

Discussion
To extend prior research on children’s EU, we investigated interpersonal predictors and
intrapersonal covariates of development in EU from 4 to 6 years in a large community
sample of Norwegian children. Results showed that more verbally and socially skilled
4-year-olds whose parents demonstrated better mentalization displayed the greatest EU
growth. Taken together, our ﬁndings and those of other studies indicate that there are
substantial individual differences not only in the level of EU but also in the pace at which
EU develops during the latter part of the preschool years. Hence, children who lag in EU in

the mid-preschool period might show rapid increases during the next few years, whereas
others display only modest improvements.

Our ﬁndings support Banerjee et al.’s (2011) claim that a lack of social skills may
impair children’s ability to develop EU. Most research on the predictors of social-cognitive
development has focused on the ﬁrst 5 years of life, a period during which parents may be
more important socialization agents than peers. In the present study, we followed
children across the transition from preschool to school, a time when friends become
important socialization agents and children develop the ability to mentalize not only their
own emotions but also other’s emotional reactions. Our results show that children’s social
skills are a predictor of growth in EU.

Among the parent-related predictors examined in this study, only parental mentaliza-
tion (not the more behavioural aspect of parental emotional availability) uniquely
predicted an increase in EU from age 4 to 6. Hence, the present data suggest that in
fostering children’s understanding of emotions, parents’ ability to mentalize is more
important than parental structuring and sensitivity, at least as measured using the
Emotional Availability Scales. If the parent knows the child’s level of EU, it may be easier to
match emotion language and emotion regulation strategies to the child’s developmental
needs. The parent can behave in a way that ﬁts the child’s zone of proximal development
to help the child foster better EU.

Or it may be a measurement effect. Parent–child interaction was rated after seeing 30-
min videotaped interaction. Many parents may show socially desirable parental behaviour
within that time span, but behave otherwise while not being observed. Whereas the way
mentalization was measured, socially desirable responding (a parent indicating that their
child understands more than it actually does) does not result in a good score, but reveals
the discrepancy between parental belief or wish and child actual performance. Future
work should seek to test these interpretations of our ﬁndings.

Our results are consistent with prior cross-sectional ﬁndings that document positive
associations between parental mentalization and children’s EU (Karstad, Kvello,
Wichstrøm, & Berg-Nielsen, 2014; Meins et al., 1998; de Rosnay et al., 2004) and
longitudinal results pertaining to the child’s theory of mind by Meins et al. (2002). Our
mentalization measure directly compares the parental estimate to the child’s actual level
of EU, and it is less time-consuming to score and interpret the results than other
mentalization measures. Future work should examine the covariation of these different
mentalization measures.

At the level of individual differences, the stability of EU was modest, with EU at age 4
predicting 2 years later to roughly the same extent as the other age-4 predictors. Starting
at age 4 (i.e., when EU is beginning to emerge), one might suspect that modest continuity
of EU might result from a ﬂoor effect at age 4 when the TEC tasks are too difﬁcult for most
4-year-olds. However, Figure 1 indicates that most children were successful on some EU
components, with children’s scores at this time varying considerably. Therefore, in
combination with high reliability of the TEC, the present ﬁndings indicate that there is
only modest stability in EU during this developmental period, at least in the population
studied. Whether this is also true in other populations is a question for future research.
Although the present research has several strengths, such as prospective multivariate
analyses of data from a large and representative community study and the inclusion of a
parental mentalization measure, the results should be interpreted in the light of several
limitations. First, although our operationalization of parental mentalization follows a well-
established tradition (Ha, Sharp, & Goodyer, 2011; Sharp et al., 2006), this speciﬁc
measure has not been validated beyond the ﬁndings of this study. Furthermore, parental

Predictors of emotion understanding

emotional availability was assessed in a laboratory setting, which might have compro-
mised the ecological validity of the study. Additionally, our reliance mainly on mothers
calls attention to the need to study fathers and, thereby, comparatively evaluate both
maternal and paternal effects – as well as their interacting inﬂuence.

While the effects detected were modest in magnitude, they are nevertheless
informative with potential translational implications. Most importantly, it should be clear
that EU is still developing by the time children start school. As well, it appears that parents’
understanding of their child’s EU capabilities contributes to its continued growth. This
suggests that efforts to facilitate such understanding may contribute to its development, a
goal which could be addressed in many ways, no doubt. For example, preschool teachers
could be encouraged to inform parents about their children’s EU in addition to the
intervention programmes already proven useful in research (Domitrovich et al., 2007;
Gavazzi & Ornaghi, 2011). If there is a large discrepancy between parent’s knowledge of
their child’s EU, mentalization-based interventions could be introduced with a special
focus on parents’ ability to read their children’s EU.
