Do social cognition and epistemological understanding promote elementary school children’s experi-
mentation skills? To investigate this question, 402 children (ages 8, 9, and 10) in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th grades
were assessed for their experimentation skills, social cognition (advanced theory of mind [AToM]),
epistemological understanding (understanding the nature of science), and general information-processing
skills (inhibition, intelligence, and language abilities) in a whole-class testing procedure. A multiple
indicators multiple causes model revealed a significant influence of social cognition (AToM) on
epistemological understanding, and a McNemar test suggested that children’s development of AToM is
an important precursor for the emergence of an advanced, mature epistemological understanding.
Children’s epistemological understanding, in turn, predicted their experimentation skills. Importantly,
this relation was independent of the common influences of general information processing. Significant
relations between experimentation skills and inhibition, and between epistemological understanding,
intelligence, and language abilities emerged, suggesting that general information processing contributes
to the conceptual development that is involved in scientific thinking. The model of scientific thinking that
was tested in this study (social cognition and epistemological understanding promote experimentation
skills) fitted the data significantly better than 2 alternative models, which assumed nonspecific, equally
strong relations between all constructs under investigation. Our results support the conclusion that social
cognition plays a foundational role in the emergence of children’s epistemological understanding, which
in turn is closely related to the development of experimentation skills. Our findings have significant
implications for the teaching of scientific thinking in elementary school and they stress the importance
of children’s epistemological understanding in scientific-thinking processes.

To understand the difference between a conclusive and an
inconclusive experiment, to be able to interpret complex patterns
of data, or to understand that science is a quest for knowledge are
just few of the important scientific-thinking skills that enable us to
intentionally seek an understanding of our environment (Kuhn,

2011). Although an increasing body of research suggests that
relevant precursors of scientific thinking already emerge in infancy
(see, e.g., Gopnik et al., 2004; Sobel, Tenenbaum, & Gopnik,
2004), significant advances in children’s scientific-thinking skills
occur in and around elementary school age (Koerber, Mayer,
Osterhaus, Schwippert, & Sodian, 2015; Piekny & Maehler, 2013),
where a broad range of advanced, more mature abilities first
emerges (for a review, see Zimmerman, 2007).

Experimentation skills have traditionally been the hallmark of
research on scientific thinking (e.g., Bullock & Ziegler, 1999;
Case, 1974; Chen & Klahr, 1999; Inhelder & Piaget, 1958; Kuhn
et al., 1995). Using diverse tasks—ranging from hands-on over
choice and selection tasks to interviews, researchers have assessed
children’s ability to design controlled experiments across a wide
range of domains (e.g., physics, mechanics, earth science, psychol-
ogy, etc.). In these tasks, children need to demonstrate that they
master the so-called control of variables strategy, which demands
that controlled experiments only vary the focal variable while
holding constant all nonfocal variables (see, e.g., Kuhn et al.,

SOCIAL COGNITION AND NOS PROMOTE EXPERIMENTATION

451

1995). Whereas studies indicate that usually only few young
elementary school children solve these tasks correctly (see, e.g.,
Bullock & Ziegler, 1999), around 65% of fourth-graders (10-year-
olds) prefer controlled over confounded experiments when they
are allowed to choose an experiment that can be used to test a
specific hypothesis (Bullock, Sodian, & Koerber, 2009).

Influences of Scientific Thinking: General Information

Processing and Epistemological Understanding

Advances in experimentation skills in particular, and in scien-
tific thinking in general, have been attributed to influences on two
broad levels, which are (a) children’s development of increased
general information-processing skills (e.g., Klahr, 2000) and (b)
their development of a conceptual understanding of the construc-
tive nature of the knowing process (e.g., Carey & Smith, 1993;
Kuhn, 2011). Evidence that supports the hypothesis that increased
general information-processing skills promote scientific thinking
comes from a growing number of research studies that reveal close
relations between interindividual differences in scientific thinking
and children’s general cognitive abilities, such as their inhibition,
intelligence, or language skills (e.g., Bullock et al., 2009; Koerber
et al., 2015; Kwon & Lawson, 2000; Mayer, Sodian, Koerber, &
Schwippert, 2014; van der Graaf, Segers, & Verhoeven, 2016).

For instance, a recent large-scale study by Koerber et al. (2015)
showed that elementary school children’s scientific thinking was
significantly related to their intelligence and language abilities,
which together explained a considerable amount of the variance
that was found in a comprehensive measure of elementary school
scientific thinking in Grades 2 to 4. Findings from Kwon and
Lawson (2000) in adolescence, in addition, suggest a firm associ-
ation between inhibition and experimentation skills, supporting the
hypothesis that the use of adequate experimentation strategies may
require reasoners to inhibit their spontaneous desire to produce a
positive outcome in favor of a thorough test of the given hypoth-
esis (Amsel et al., 2008; Kuhn & Franklin, 2006; Kuhn & Pease,
2006). Although the evidence from both the Koerber et al. (2015)
and the Kwon and Lawson (2000) study, as well as from several
other studies (e.g., Bullock et al., 2009; Mayer et al., 2014; van der
Graaf et al., 2016), highlights the importance of increased general
information-processing skills in children’s development of scien-
tific thinking, studies of interindividual differences in scientific
thinking often leave a considerable amount of variance unex-
plained when only predictors on the level of general information
processing are included.

Social Cognition and Scientific Thinking

Many theorists have argued that a reference to general informa-
tion processing alone does not allow to fully explain advances in
children’s scientific thinking (e.g., Kuhn, Cheney, & Weinstock,
2000; Sodian & Bullock, 2008). Rather, they suggest, children
need to develop an epistemological understanding and an appre-
ciation of the constructive nature of knowledge acquisition. This
understanding entails an appreciation of the nature of science
(NOS), which involves a conceptual understanding of the nature of
knowledge (conditions of knowing), as well as an appreciation of
the broad epistemic concepts that are relevant in science, such as
for instance theory, hypothesis, evidence, or falsification (see, e.g.,

Koerber, Osterhaus, & Sodian, 2015). All these aspects of NOS
require that children understand the distinction between ideas and
states of the world (Carey, Evans, Honda, Jay, & Unger, 1989),
that is, they have to understand that hypothesis and evidence are
two epistemologically distinct categories that inform each other,
but which do not need to coincide (Kuhn, 2011).

Children acquire the most fundamental prerequisite for the
emergence of this understanding already before they enter elemen-
tary school, around the age 4, when they develop an initial theory
of mind, which allows them to understand that mental states are
constructed by an active subject (Carpendale & Chandler, 1996;
Kuhn, 2000). From this point on, children understand that beliefs
may differ in content from reality. Once they are able to make this
distinction (between beliefs and reality), they are also able to
understand how empirical evidence can be brought to bear on
hypothetical beliefs. Studies of false belief understanding in self
and others indicate that a conceptual grasp of one’s own epistemic
states develops around the same time as the ability to infer others’
epistemic states, and is supported by a common conceptual system
(Wellman, Cross, & Watson, 2001).

There is reason to assume that later developing social cognition
and advanced theory of mind (AToM), which fully emerges in
elementary school age (Osterhaus, Koerber, & Sodian, 2016; for a
review, see Miller, 2009), are conceptually closely related to the
epistemological understanding involved in NOS. Specifically, it
has been suggested that children need to acquire an AToM before
they can understand that hypotheses (beliefs) are informed not
directly by evidence but rather are supported by a number of
reasons (our interpretation of evidence or other beliefs, which, e.g.,
may be drawn from the specific cultural background; see Asting-
ton, Pelletier, & Homer, 2002). This understanding requires the
representation of higher order beliefs and an appreciation of the
recursive nature of mental states (Perner, 1988), which are two
aspects that are crucially involved in AToM cognition (Miller,
2009). It thus seems likely that these abilities are foundational for
the emergence of children’s epistemological understanding and
their grasp of the hypothesis– evidence relation, which is critically
involved in NOS (see, e.g., Carey & Smith, 1993).

According to this hypothesis, children who have not acquired
the ability to represent higher order beliefs and who do not under-
stand the recursive nature of mental states will be less likely to
reveal a mature epistemological understanding: Specifically, they
will be less likely to recognize that the truthfulness of a hypothesis
depends on the collection of individual beliefs that support it; they
will not appreciate that these beliefs need not exclusively be based
on evidence, but that they can also be drawn from a framework
theory or be grounded in the specific sociocultural context; and
finally, they will not immediately understand falsification, which
requires understanding that hypotheses are disconfirmed by true
beliefs that state the opposite of the initial belief.

Evidence that supports the hypothesis that children’s AToM is
related to their development of an epistemological understanding
comes from a study by Astington et al. (2002), who investigated
the relation between children’s performance on two second-order
false-belief tasks (AToM) and two evidence tests (epistemological
understanding) in a sample of 5- to 7-year-olds. In one of the
second-order false-belief tasks, for instance, Astington and col-
leagues presented children with a story about a Protagonist A who
secretly displaces an object, an action that is observed by a second

Protagonist B (Protagonist A does not want Protagonist B to know
about the displacement of the object, and Protagonist A does not
know that Protagonist B observes her while she displaces the
object). The test question asked children where Protagonist A
thinks that Protagonist B will look for the object. The evidence
tasks tested children for their ability to reason about evidence, and
specifically, children were asked about the physical cause of an
event and about a person’s evidence for it (e.g., someone spilling
water and the floor being wet). To solve the evidence tasks
correctly, children needed to successfully distinguish between
cause and evidence, revealing an understanding of the differenti-
ation between these two epistemologically distinct entities. Asting-
ton et al.’s results indicated that AToM (here second-order false-
belief understanding) was indeed significantly related to children’s
epistemological understanding (here performance on the evidence
test). This was true even when the influences of general language
and nonverbal abilities were accounted for. Whereas the study by
Astington et al. (2002) thus shows that children’s AToM is sig-
nificantly related to their understanding of evidence, which is a
relevant aspect of children’s epistemological understanding, there
is hitherto no study that investigated whether children’s general
AToM is related to their broader epistemological understanding
and their general views on NOS, which involve broader epistemic
concepts such as theory, inference, or falsification.

Epistemological Understanding and Scientific Thinking

Several theorists have suggested that children’s epistemological
understanding is closely related to their experimentation skills
(e.g., Kuhn, 2011). Evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes
from a number of training studies on children’s experimentation
skills (e.g., Strand-Cary & Klahr, 2008) that revealed the impor-
tance of including instruction strategies targeted at children’s
conceptual understanding of experimentation, analysis, or infer-
ence. Further evidence that points to the importance of children’s
epistemological understanding for their experimentation skills
comes from a study by Sodian, Thoermer, Kircher, Grygier, and
Günther (2002) who, in accordance with this hypothesis, observed
more adequate experimentation strategies in fourth-graders after
children had received an intervention that promoted their episte-
mological understanding. Specifically, the curricular intervention
that Sodian and her colleagues used addressed children’s views on
NOS, and it sought to foster their understanding of the relation
between hypotheses and evidence. Children were instructed about
the goals of science, and they learned that the purpose of science
is to construct knowledge, and that scientists conduct experiments
to find deeper explanations for observed phenomena (see also
Carey et al., 1989). Interestingly, and despite the fact that exper-
imentation strategies were not explicitly addressed in the interven-
tion, the increase in adequate, systematic experimentation that
Sodian and her colleagues observed from pre- to posttest was
significant: While only 35% of all children in the treatment group
chose an adequate experiment prior to the intervention, this per-
centage increased to 65% on posttest, clearly supporting the hy-
pothesis that promoting children’s understanding of the NOS is not
only reflected by more mature views on NOS, but also that
beneficial effects emerge for experimentation skills. Whereas the
literature on training studies on experimentation thus highlights the
importance of a mature epistemological understanding for promot-

ing children’s experimentation skills, little is hitherto known about
the relation between interindividual differences in these two con-
structs across different age groups in elementary school.

The Present Study

The present study, therefore, investigates whether AToM and
NOS promote children experimentation skills in a broad range of
age groups in elementary school. Specifically, we investigate (a)
whether AToM is, as hypothesized, an important precursor of
children’s broad epistemological understanding (NOS);
(b)
whether interindividual differences in NOS relate to children’s
experimentation skills; and (c) whether the potentially emerging
relations between AToM, NOS, and experimentation skills are
independent of the influences of general information processing. In
line with findings from Sodian et al. (2002), who showed a
significant influence of NOS on experimentation skills in fourth-
graders, we expect to find a substantial relation between these two
aspects of scientific thinking (see Figure 1 for a summary of the
hypotheses of this study). In addition, we expect that AToM will
be related to NOS, and that AToM will be a significant precursor
of children’s epistemological understanding (NOS). In accordance
with findings from Kwon and Lawson (2000) in adolescence, we
expect to find a significant relation between experimentation and
inhibition, but not between inhibition and NOS (see Mayer et al.,
2014, for a finding of nonsignificant relation between inhibition
and a scientific-thinking measure that included many items on
NOS). Finally, we expect the data to reveal significant relations
between intelligence, language abilities, and NOS. We expect
these general information-processing variables to have a stronger
influence on NOS than on experimentation skills because NOS not
only requires the acquisition of conceptual knowledge but, unlike
experimentation strategies, it also involves knowledge about spe-
cific terminology, which may be easier to acquire for children with
high general abilities. We tested these hypotheses in a sample of
402 elementary school children in Grades 2, 3, and 4 (8-, 9-, and

10-year-olds) who were tested for their experimentation skills,
their social cognition (AToM), epistemological understanding
(NOS), and their general information-processing skills (inhibition,
intelligence, and language abilities) in a whole-class testing pro-
cedure.

Method

Participants

Participants were 402 second-, third-, and fourth-graders (203
girls). There were 124 second-graders (M ⫽ 8 years 3 months,
SD ⫽ 9 months; 64 girls), 135 third-graders (M ⫽ 9 years 4
months, SD ⫽ 7 months; 62 girls), and 143 fourth-graders (M ⫽ 10
years 2 months, SD ⫽ 9 months, 77 girls). We recruited the
children from 25 classrooms from mostly middle-class schools in
Germany. These schools participated in a larger project on cogni-
tive development in elementary school (Osterhaus, Koerber, &
Sodian, 2015, 2016). Twenty-eight percent of all children spoke at
least one language other than German at home. Parents’ written
consent was obtained for all children. Data were collected from
June 2013 to July 2013.

Materials and Procedure

The children were tested in a whole-class testing procedure for
their experimentation skills, their epistemological understanding
social cognition (AToM), and their general
(NOS),
information-processing skills (inhibition,
intelligence, and lan-
guage skills).

their

Experimentation skills. Children’s experimentation skills
were assessed with an inventory that comprises 11 fictitious ex-
periments in artificial contexts, each containing a design error that

violates the demands of experimental contrast or experimental
control (e.g.,
lack of a control group, no premeasure in a
pre–post design, or a missing control of nonfocal variables; for
an example, see Figure 2; for the full item set, see the online
supplement; see also Bullock et al., 2009; Osterhaus, Koerber,
& Sodian, 2015). On each of the items, children have to indicate
whether they agree with each of three statements: two of them
give a justification of why the experiment described in the item
is good, one of them explains why it is not, indicating the
design error in question.

Items were coded dichotomously, and children only obtained a
correct score for the entire item when they selected the correct
answer option and rejected the two incorrect ones. The instrument
has been shown to be a valid indicator of children’s experimenta-
tion skills (as compared to an interview measure and several other
widely used experimentation tasks), and a Rasch analysis indicated
good item fit indices for all 11 items and a good reliability
(Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .72; Osterhaus et al., 2015).

Epistemological understanding (NOS). Children’s episte-
mological understanding and their views on NOS were assessed
using five items that tapped children’s understanding of the
nature of (a) theories (Items 1 and 2), (b) the influences of
cultural framework theories (Item 3), (c) the role of basic
assumptions in science (Item 4), and (c) falsification (Item 5).
All five items address children’s understanding of the relation
between hypotheses or theories and evidence (see Kuhn, 2011),
and each item contains three answers that children have to agree
or disagree with. These answers correspond to three compe-
tence levels, which are defined as naïve,
intermediate, and
advanced (see Koerber et al., 2015).

Item 1 (nature of theories) asks children to indicate whether three
statements are each a good example of a theory (see Figure 3). Only

the advanced level (“Simon believes that children get bad grades
because they do not do their homework”) presents children with a
theory that allows for a full evaluation of the supporting belief.
While being true statements, the naïve and intermediate level
(“Lucas believes that 1 ⫹ 1 ⫽ 2 because every little child knows
this,” and “Marc believes that the earth rotates because he has a
globe at home,” respectively) are not testable beliefs.

Item 2 (nature of theories) tests whether children understand that
theories are not immediately given up when evidence is presented
that may contradict the initial theory, but that rather reasoners will
try to find an explanation that can justify the occurrence of the
counterevidence, allowing them to maintain the initial theory. To
test for this understanding, the item asks children to evaluate three
possibilities of how a girl with a given theory (“If you study hard,
you get good grades”) will react to counterevidence (“This boy,
Paul, says he does not study hard, but nonetheless he gets good
grades”). Only the advanced answer comprises an explanation that
allows the protagonist to fully maintain her initial theory (“Paul
secretly does study”). The other two answers options (“Paul is
super smart, he does not need to study” and “The exam was too
easy”) reflect answers that are not fully theory-conform but rather
describe exceptions to the initial theory. Note that all three answer
options were equally likely (i.e., no information was given about
whether or not Paul is smart or lying, or whether the exam was
easy or difficult). Thus all three answer options differ substantially
in the degree to which they allow the story protagonist to maintain
her initial theory.

(1992), and it was drawn from a study by Koerber et al. (2015).
Specifically, the item tests whether children understand that hy-
potheses are not only supported by evidence, but that they can also
obtain support from cultural beliefs, which, in addition, may in-
fluence the interpretation of evidence (see Figure 4).

Item 4 (role of basic assumptions) probes children’s understand-
ing of the potential influences of scientists’ basic assumptions on
their interpretation of evidence. Children are asked to indicate
whether scientists can make mistakes (naïve answer: “Scientists
know a lot; therefore, they do not make mistakes”; intermediate
answer: “Sometimes they use instruments that do not work; then
they make mistakes,” and advanced answer: “Their basic assump-
tions can be wrong”).

Item 5 (falsification) tests whether children understand the su-
periority of falsification over verification and over strategies aimed
at the production of an effect (see Figure 5).

Items were coded as naïve (0), intermediate (1), or advanced (2);
decisive for the final item score was the lowest level accepted. The
reliability for the five items was low (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .45). Prior
studies in which these items were used, however, revealed that
these items adequately tap children’s scientific-thinking skills, as
revealed by several Rasch analyses (see Koerber, Mayer, et al.,
2015; Mayer et al., 2014). In addition, Items 3 and 5 were vali-
dated in a study which revealed a good convergence between
children’s performance on the paper-and-pencil version and their
understanding as revealed in an interview (see Koerber et al.,
2015).

Social cognition (AToM). Children’s AToM was measured
with seven items that assess their “social reasoning” (see Oster-
haus et al., 2016). These items tap children’s understanding of the
recursive nature of mental states, and they include various, meth-
odologically distinct task. Specifically, we used three items on
second- and higher order false belief understanding (Astington et
al., 2002; Liddle & Nettle, 2006), one item from Happé’s (1994)
Strange Stories, and four items from the Reading the Mind in the
Eyes Test (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plumb,
2001).

The second-order false-belief item is based on a task designed
by Astington et al. (2002), which is described in the introduction.
In this task, children are presented with a cover story about a
protagonist who displaces an object, an action that is observed by
a second protagonist (this is, however, unknown to the first pro-
tagonist). The target question asks children where they believe the
first protagonist thinks the second protagonist will look for the
object. To assess children’s understanding of more complex,
higher order false-belief reasoning we used two tasks that were
adapted from Liddle and Nettle (2006). These tasks are presented
in Figure 6.

In addition to children’s higher order false-belief understanding,
we assessed their understanding of intentional, nonliteral speech,
using one task from the Strange Stories (Happé, 1994). In this
story problem, children are presented with a story about a soldier
who uses a double bluff as not to reveal the true location of an
arsenal. The test questions asks children whether it is true what the
protagonist says, and why he says that. Children were presented
with two answer options, which are (a) a mental-state justification
(correct) and (b) a physical-state justification (incorrect).

Also, we assessed children’s ability to read nonaffective mental
states from the eyes. Specifically, we used four items from the

Procedure. All tests were administered in a whole-class test-
ing procedure. Tasks were read out to the children, and they were
also presented in a PowerPoint presentation. Test assistants made
sure that the children remained quiet and worked on their own
booklet. On Day 1, children were tested for their experimentation
skills, inhibition, and AToM. On Day 2, NOS, intelligence, and
language skills were assessed. Each of the two sessions took about
80 min, and their order was counterbalanced between classrooms.

German version (Bölte, 2005) of the Eyes Test (Baron-Cohen,
Wheelwright, Hill, et al., 2001). Each of these four items presents
the children with a photograph of an either male or female face
showing only the eyes. Four answer options (mental states) are
presented for each item, and the children have to select the appro-
priate one. The mental states that were used in this study were
serious, interested, uneasy, and assertive.

Items were scored dichotomously, and the reliability was mod-
erate (Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .51). All items have, in prior studies, been
shown to be valid assessments of children’s AToM, all loading on
a single factor. In addition, a latent class analysis revealed that
children’s performance on these items depends, despite their meth-
odological differences, on a common underlying conceptual un-
derstanding (see Osterhaus et al., 2016).

Intelligence was measured with Subtests 1
(“Progressive Series,” 15 items) and 4 (“Topological Relation-
ships,” 10 items) of the German version of the Culture Fair
Intelligence Test (Wei␤, 2006; Cronbach’s ␣ ⫽ .68).

Testing the Postulated Model of Scientific Thinking

To test the assumption that experimentation skills and NOS
comprise two separable aspects of scientific thinking on which
many of our hypotheses under investigation in this study are built
on, we conducted an exploratory factor analysis of all
items
assessing experimentation and NOS in Mplus 7 (Muthén &
Muthén, 2012), using a mean- and variance-adjusted weighted
least-squares estimator and oblique geomin rotation, which al-

lowed factors to correlate. The results indicated a poor fit of a
one-factor model: Although some fit indices pointed toward an
adequate fit of this one-dimensional model (comparative fit index
[CFI] ⫽ .99, Tucker–Lewis index [TLI] ⫽ .98, and root-mean-
square error of approximation [RMSEA] ⫽ .03 [.02, .04]), the ␹2
statistic indicated a significant deviation of the model from the
data, with ␹2(104) ⫽ 143.88, p ⫽ .01. In contrast, the two-factor
model revealed a good fit to the data according to all fit indices,
with ␹2(89) ⫽ 89.00, p ⫽ .48, CFI ⫽ 1.00, TLI ⫽ 1.00, and
RMSEA ⫽ .00 [.00, .03]. With the exception of a single cross-
loading, all experimentation and NOS items loaded exclusively on
their respective factor (see Table 1). The factor correlation was .54.
The two-factor model was also supported by parallel analysis
(Dinno, 2009), which gives a more conservative estimate of the
number of factors by correcting for the effects of sampling error on
eigenvalues. This analysis revealed two corrected eigenvalues
larger than the retention criterion of 0.

To test whether children’s experimentation skills and their NOS
are interrelated, as well as to test whether AToM predicts chil-
dren’s NOS, we fitted a multiple indicators multiple causes

(MIMIC) model (Jöreskog & Goldberger, 1975) to the data (see
Table 2 for the sample correlation matrix). The MIMIC approach
can be compared to multivariate multivariate analysis of variance
in that these models evaluate the effect of the covariates (here
inhibition, AToM, intelligence, and language) on the latent means
of the dependent variables (Elosua & Muñiz, 2010). The MIMIC
model (see Table 3, unconstrained model, and Figure 8) includ-
ed—next to a path from NOS to experimentation—paths from all
independent variables to NOS and experimentation, as well as
correlations between all independent variables, so that common
mutual influences were controlled for. The results revealed a good
fit of the model, with ␹2(159) ⫽ 167.35, p ⫽ .31, and CFI ⫽ 1.00,
TLI ⫽ 1.00, and RMSEA ⫽ .01 [.00, .03]. As predicted, there was
a significant relation between NOS and experimentation (.57), and
between inhibition and experimentation (.22), resulting in an ex-
plained variance of 39% in experimentation. The path from inhi-
bition to NOS (.00) was not significant, indicating that the ob-
served sample correlation between these two constructs most
probably resulted from the influence of inhibition on AToM.

The hypothesis that children’s acquisition of AToM is an im-
portant precursor for the development of their epistemological
understanding was supported by a significant path (.20) between
AToM and NOS. Additional support came from a McNemar test,
which showed that the two proportions of children with no mastery
in AToM but mastery in NOS (5%) and of those with mastery in
AToM but no mastery of NOS (52%) were different (p ⬍ .001, see
Table 3). These proportions were similar within each grade level:
they were 6 and 46% in Grade 2, 4 and 59% in Grade 3, and 4 and
49% in Grade 4 (all ps ⬍ .001).

Finally, we predicted that children’s general information pro-
cessing is more closely related to the development of NOS than to
experimentation strategies. This hypothesis was supported by sig-
nificant paths from intelligence (.19) and language skills (.26) on
NOS, which were nonsignificant for experimentation skills (.01
and ⫺.05, respectively). Together with the influence of AToM, the
amount of explained variance in NOS was 21%.

Because the NOS items included in our study revealed a low
internal consistency and prior research suggested that children’s

development of an epistemological understanding may follow dis-
tinct pathways (Koerber et al., 2015), we inspected whether the
relation between NOS, AToM, and experimentation skills differed
between the two distinct types of NOS items included in this study.
Specifically, we investigated whether the correlation between ex-
perimentation skills, AToM, and NOS Items 2 and 3 differed from
the correlation with NOS Items 1, 4, and 5. NOS Items 2 and 3 tap
children’s knowledge about knowledge in a more direct way than
NOS Items 1, 4, and 5 which assess children’s epistemological
understanding of a scientific principle. The correlation between
experimentation skills and NOS was .20 [.11, .29] for Items 2 and
3, and .31 [.21, .40] for Items 1, 4, and 5 (95% confidence interval
in square brackets). The correlation between AToM the two as-
pects of NOS was .15 [.05, .25] and .13 [.03, .22], respectively,
indicating that the strength of the association did not differ for
these two types of items.

To test whether our model of scientific thinking with its specific
hypotheses (see Figure 1) fitted the data better than any other
theoretically motivated model, we compared our account of the
influences of interindividual differences in scientific thinking to
two competing models. These models predicted relations between
scientific thinking and all cognitive variables included in this study
(AToM, inhibition, intelligence, and language) that differed from
the predictions of our model: The first model defines scientific-
thinking skills as a unitary construct, thereby positing equal cog-
nitive influences of inhibition, intelligence, and language on ex-
perimentation skills and NOS (equal-influences model; see Mayer
et al., 2014). The second model that we compared to our account
of scientific thinking assumes that the hypothesized correlation
between NOS and AToM merely is a product of the common task
demand of constructing multiple mental representations, which
underlies three of the six constructs that we address in this study
(NOS, experimentation, and AToM). Specifically, we reasoned
that, if this competing model holds and the postulated relation
between NOS and AToM is a spurious one, a significant relation
should not only emerge between AToM and NOS but also between
AToM and experimentation skills, which—just like NOS—are
abilities that require that children entertain multiple mental repre-
sentations simultaneously (common task-demands model).

We estimated and compared these two models (the equal-
influences and common task-demands models) to the uncon-
strained model, which included paths from all covariates to both
NOS and experimentation (as reported above). Chi-square differ-
ence testing for these two models and the unconstrained, full
model (see Table 3) revealed that both the equal-influences and the
common task-demands model fitted significantly worse than the

unconstrained model. Compared to the unconstrained model, only
our hypothesized model revealed no significant difference in fit.
This model included, next to all postulated paths (see Figure 1),
paths from inhibition to NOS, and from AToM, language, and
intelligence to experimentation skills that were all constrained to
be equal to 0. The nonsignificant difference in fit from the uncon-
strained model hereby supports the hypothesis that the influences
of the cognitive covariates indeed are, as hypothesized specific and
of different magnitudes for NOS and experimentation skills.

Discussion

Do children’s social cognition and their epistemological under-
standing promote experimentation skills in elementary school?
The findings of the present study revealed that (a) social cognition
(AToM) is an important precursor of children’s broad epistemo-
logical understanding (NOS), which (b) in turn explains a large
amount of interindividual differences in elementary school chil-
dren’s experimentation skills. Importantly, the relation between
epistemological understanding and experimentation was (c) inde-
pendent of the influences of children’s general information pro-
cessing. This finding gives support to the hypothesis that chil-
dren’s development of an epistemological understanding is
foundational for the emergence of scientific thinking.

Social Cognition as a Precursor of Children’s
Epistemological Understanding

Children’s epistemological understanding, we suggested, builds
on their social cognition, and specifically, on their development of
an AToM, which enables children to represent higher order beliefs
and to understand that mental states are of a recursive nature

(Perner, 1988). Indeed, our results showed that AToM is an im-
portant precursor of NOS: Only 5% of all children who did not
master ATOM mastered NOS. Being able to understand that
beliefs are informed by reasons (supporting beliefs), seems to
enable children to develop an evaluative epistemology (see Kuhn
et al., 2000), which allows them to acknowledge that hypotheses
and evidence do not necessarily need to coincide, but that they
rather are two distinct epistemological categories. Having acquired
this understanding, children begin to appreciate that hypotheses
need to build on testable beliefs, that they gain their support not
only from evidence but also from theoretical considerations (Ko-
slowski, 1996), and that informative experiments should not give
support to multiple beliefs with conflicting content. Further sup-
port for the hypothesis that AToM is indeed an important precursor
of children’s epistemological understanding comes from recent
results from longitudinal study (see Sodian, Kristen-Antonow, &
Koerber, 2016) that revealed that first- and second-order false-
belief understanding at age 5 predict scientific reasoning at 8 years
independently of intelligence and executive functions.

AToM has been associated in a prior study with children’s
understanding of evidence (Astington et al., 2002), which is one
aspect of epistemological understanding, and researchers are in-

vestigating how children’s growing understanding of the interpre-
tative nature of the mind influences their understanding of NOS
(Weinstock, Danay, & Harari, 2016). Our study however is the
first to relate children’s AToM to diverse aspects of NOS, which
include epistemic concepts as broad as theory, inference, or falsi-
fication. It is important to note that our study used thoroughly
investigated measures of AToM, which all tap a common concep-
tual understanding (see Osterhaus et al., 2016). Having used
AToM measures that were methodologically distinct (e.g., some
measures were story problems, others required children to read of
mental states from the eyes), but
that all require a common
underlying ability (understanding the recursive nature of mental
states), makes it unlikely that relations between AToM and NOS
arose from possible common task demands that were not con-
trolled for by the model (as inhibition, intelligence, or language
abilities).

The finding that AToM is an important precursor for NOS is an
interesting finding that will contribute to our understanding of the
emergence of children’s epistemological understanding. In addi-
tion, it may explain some of the empirical findings regarding the
developmental influences of NOS. For instance, Koerber et al.
(2015) found a significant influence of parents’ education on
children’s NOS. Influences of parents’ education on children’s
social cognition have widely been reported in the literature (e.g.,
Cutting & Dunn, 1999), and indeed this relation may explain why
parental education effects merge for NOS, which may be mediated
by their influences on social cognition. Specifically, there is reason
to assume that parents with a higher education may engage with
their children in different kinds of talk and interaction, which may
involve more ascriptions of and reflections on complex mental
states, potentially leading to children’s increased ability to engage
in “transactive” discussions. In transactive discussions, children’s
reasoning operates on their partner’s reasoning, which is an activ-
ity that requires AToM and that research has related to advances in
scientific thinking (Azmitia & Montgomery, 1993). Although fur-
ther research is needed, it is conceivable that social cognition and
transactive discussions are the potential mechanisms that link
parents’ education and children’s epistemological understanding.

Scientific Thinking and Children’s
Epistemological Understanding

Children’s epistemological understanding has been attributed an
important role in scientific thinking by multiple authors (Kuhn,
2011; Sodian & Bullock, 2008). Research has shown that promot-
ing children’s understanding of the hypothesis– evidence relation
indeed not only increases their understanding of NOS, but also
leads to better experimentation strategies (Sodian et al., 2002). A
recent study on the development of scientific thinking in elemen-
tary school (Koerber, Mayer, et al., 2015), in addition, suggests
that children’s understanding of the hypothesis– evidence relation
may underlie performance gains not only in experimentation but in
a wide range of tasks, including data interpretation. The substantial
correlation that we identified between NOS and experimentation
skills supports this conclusion.

There has been a debate in the literature as to whether NOS and
inquiry skills, such as experimentation skills, indeed form two
separable aspects of scientific thinking (see Lederman, 2006; Neu-
mann, Neumann, & Nehm, 2011). The results of our exploratory

factor analysis, which revealed a superior fit of a two-factor model
to the data, suggest indeed a separation of these two components,
which is a finding that is in line earlier findings for adults (Neu-
mann et al., 2011). However, the substantial correlation that we
observed between NOS and experimentation skills clearly shows
that children’s epistemological understanding is closely related to
their abilities in experimentation, suggesting that NOS may be a
foundational skill that helps to guide children’s inquiry. Although
a separation of NOS and inquiry skills may thus not seem entirely
warranted on a theoretical level, our results do however show that
the empirical distinction is useful: The MIMIC model revealed
differential cognitive influences on NOS and experimentation,
suggesting that a separate assessment of these constructs may lead
to more robust results. Indeed, the differential cognitive influences
may explain why a recent study by Mayer et al. (2014) did not find
a significant relation between scientific thinking and inhibition,
when NOS and inquiry skilled were not modeled separately.

Whereas experimentation skills were found to be a relatively
homogeneous construct in the present study (as revealed by high
factor loadings for all items and a good reliability), and no sub-
stantially different results emerged for specific subgroups of ex-
perimentation items (e.g., contrastive vs. controlled-contrastive
experiments), our results again pointed to the broad nature of NOS,
as revealed by the low internal consistency that we found for our
five NOS items. Indeed, researchers have suggested that there may
be different pathways along which children acquire NOS. Thus
while some children may for instance first acquire an understand-
ing of the epistemic concept theory, others’ epistemological un-
derstanding may emerge with a nascent understanding of falsifi-
cation (see Koerber et al., 2015). Whereas this may be one possible
explanation for the low internal consistency that we found for our
NOS measure, this lack of reliability does not question our find-
ings at large: First, our exploratory factor analysis revealed that all
NOS items were indicators of the latent construct NOS. Second,
we used a latent variable model to estimate the relation between
NOS and experimentation skills, as well as their cognitive influ-
ences, which is less sensitive to possibly distorting influences of
the low reliability of a measure. And third, neither the association
between NOS and experimentation nor between NOS and AToM
diverged for different subgroups of NOS items.

General Information Processing and Interindividual
Differences in Scientific Thinking

In addition to the influence of AToM on NOS, and of NOS on
experimentation skills, our study revealed significant influences of
children’s general cognitive development (inhibition, intelligence,
and language skills) on their scientific thinking. Inhibition has
been associated in prior studies with adolescents’ scientific think-
ing (Kwon & Lawson, 2000). The current study, however, is the
first to identify a positive relation between inhibition and experi-
mentation skills in elementary school. It is hereby important to
note that our experimentation task required children to evaluate
experimental designs rather than to produce or choose an adequate
strategy. Production and choice tasks are often overly biased by
nonessential, task-related influences, such as the specific hypoth-
eses presented in the task or by children’s prior knowledge (Croker
& Buchanan, 2011; Tschirgi, 1980), which are two factors that
strongly influence their desire to produce a certain outcome.

OSTERHAUS, KOERBER, AND SODIAN

Therefore, it is likely that our study would have identified an even
higher influence of inhibition if we had not chosen for a justifica-
tion task, which may trigger less effect-production strategies.

Although our analyses revealed an observed correlation between
inhibition and NOS, the MIMIC model indicated that this relation
was not significant, suggesting that
the observed association
emerged from the influence of inhibition on AToM. This finding
is in line with results from Mayer et al. (2014) who did not find a
relation between inhibition and a scientific-thinking assessment
that included a wide range of NOS tasks, suggesting that inhibition
is indeed more closely linked to experimentation strategies than to
the conceptual knowledge about the nature of knowing involved in
NOS.

Inhibitory processes have, however, been related to tests of
conceptual knowledge, which are hypothesized to require an inhi-
bition of intuitive or naïve conceptions (Vosniadou, 2014). Fol-
lowing this line of reasoning, one may connect NOS and its
conceptual-development account
to inhibition on a theoretical
level. Because influences of executive control on conceptual
knowledge, however, typically emerge when speeded tests are
used (Vosniadou et al., 2015), our finding that inhibition and
children’s conceptions of NOS are not significantly associated
does not contradict a conceptual-development account of NOS
(Carey et al., 1989). Rather, it reveals that an inhibition of naïve
epistemological beliefs may not be necessary when children solve
tasks that explicitly address different conceptions, offering suffi-
cient time for the evaluation of each single statement.

Implications and Future Directions

Implications for research concern first and foremost the devel-
opment of tasks designed to assess scientific thinking. Children’s
poor performance in experimentation tasks is often attributed to
their immature epistemological understanding and their inability to
differentiate hypotheses from evidence. Indeed, our results regard-
ing the close relation between our NOS and experimentation tasks
support this interpretation. However, our results also show that
experimentation skills are not only influenced by children’s epis-
temological understanding, but also by their inhibition. And be-
cause research has shown that inhibition on a given task can be
obtained when children for instance are presented with a hypoth-
esis that contradicts their intuitive beliefs (Klaczynski, 2000),
researchers need to carefully develop and thoroughly test their
tasks so that performance is not overly influenced by nonessential
task characteristics (such as the intuitive or contraintuitive nature
of the hypotheses presented). Only tasks that take these effects into
consideration will result in valid estimates of children’s scientific-
thinking skills
the
hypothesis– evidence relation in particular.

in general and their understanding of

Implications for the teaching of scientific thinking in elementary
school, on the contrary, include the make use of this effect, which
is undesired in research. Specifically, children’s scientific-thinking
skills may particularly benefit from classroom experimentation
when teachers instruct children to test hypotheses that contradict
their initial beliefs. Although this may not always lead to a revision
of conceptual knowledge within the domain within which the
experiment is carried out (see, e.g., Chinn & Malhotra, 2002),
children may gain insights about how to design informative ex-
periments when they are instructed to conduct experiments that

test hypotheses in which they do not initially believe. This may
lead to an inhibition of children’s desire to produce a certain
outcome in favor of a more analytical processing, thereby serving
as a form of scaffolding, which may lead to better strategy use than
the use of illustrative experiments (i.e., experiments that teachers
use to illustrate a given scientific law or principle). It seems
reasonable to assume that this approach, which calls for testing
counterintuitive hypotheses, may initiate the learning of adequate
experimentation strategies. Meanwhile, our results suggest that an
active engagement in complex scientific-thinking activities in el-
ementary school may only be useful once children acquire an
AToM, which allows them to fully appreciate the differentiation
between hypothesis and evidence and to build a constructivist
understanding of NOS.

Future directions include two main lines of research. First, the
present study suggests that social cognition is an important pre-
requisite for the development of NOS and experimentation skills.
Therefore, future work should investigate whether a training of
AToM in elementary school may help to increase children’s epis-
temological understanding and their experimentation skills. Sec-
ond, future research needs to disentangle the precise nature of the
relation between children’s epistemological understanding and
their experimentation skills. While we were primarily interested in
the influence of epistemological understanding on experimenta-
tion, future research needs to investigate whether this relation may
indeed be bidirectional (i.e., does children’s experience with ex-
perimentation aid the emergence of NOS?). Microgenetic studies
of experimentation strategies (e.g., Schauble, 1996) typically find
that children begin their exploration of a causal domain with
unguided experiments, and that systematic and adequate experi-
mentation strategies are more often used once children discover
that their (wrong) hypotheses do not permit a successful prediction
of the outcome. It is conceivable that this feedback fosters an
adequate NOS understanding, especially so when children possess
the necessary general cognitive abilities that are relevant to ab-
stract conclusions and conceptual knowledge from this learning
experience. While being an important precursor, AToM develop-
ment alone does not fully explain the emergence of NOS in
elementary school, making necessary future research on additional
developmental mechanisms that together with AToM bring about
the emergence of NOS.

Conclusion

Our results relate elementary school children’s scientific think-
ing to their epistemological understanding and their social cogni-
tion. AToM seems to play a crucial role in the development of
children’s epistemological understanding, which is critically in-
volved in scientific-thinking skills in elementary school.
