 DuBOw, ERIC F.; TISAK, JOHN; CAUSEY, DAVID; HRYSHKO, ANN; and REID, GRAHAM. A Two-Year
 Longitudinal Study of Stressful Life Events, Social Support, and Social Problem-Solving Skills:
 Contributions to Children's Behavioral and Academic Adjustment. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1991,
 62, 583-599. We investigated the contributions of stressful life events and resources (social
 support and social problem-solving skills) to predicting changes in children's adjustment. At
 Time 1, 361 third through fifth graders completed measures of social support and social problem-
 solving skills. Their parents completed a stressful life events scale and a child behavior rating
 measure. The children's teachers provided ratings of behavioral and academic adjustment. 2-year
 follow-up data (Time 2) were obtained for approximately half of the sample on the same mea-
 sures. Time 1 stressful life events and resources showed some significant but modest zero-order
 correlations with the Time 2 adjustment indices. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed
 prospective effects for Time 1 social support on later teacher-rated competencies and grade-point
 average. In addition, increases over time in social support and social problem-solving skills (a
 composite score) were significantly related to improvement in behavioral and academic adjust-
 ment, whereas stressful life events were not predictive of adjustment.

 There is now a great deal of evidence

 supporting a relation between exposure to
 cumulative stressful life events (e.g., paren-
 tal separation/divorce, change in school or
 residence, mother becoming employed) and
 emotional and behavioral maladjustment in
 children and adolescents (e.g., Compas,
 Howell, Phares, Williams, & Giunta, 1989;
 Dubow & Tisak, 1989). Because the rela-
 tions are only modest in magnitude, re-
 searchers have begun to examine the con-
 tribution of environmental and personal
 resources to predicting adjustment in chil-
 dren (Compas, 1987; Rutter, 1987). For the
 most part, these studies have been cross-
 sectional in nature, and are thus unable to
 address the potential etiological impact of
 stressful life events and resource variables
 on adjustment. The few prospective studies
 involving children and adolescents (Cohen,
 Burt, & Bjorck, 1987; Compas et al., 1989;
 Gersten, Langner, Eisenberg, & Simcha-

 Fagan, 1977; Swearingen & Cohen, 1985)
 have generally focused on children past the
 elementary school ages and have generally
 placed more emphasis on the contribution of
 risk factors rather than resource variables.

 Gersten et al. (1977) found that mothers'

 reports of their children's stressful life
 events failed to predict behavioral adjust-
 ment 5 years later, after controlling for initial
 level of adjustment and other chronic pro-
 cesses (sociodemographic, family environ-
 ment, and parenting variables). Swearingen
 and Cohen (1985) utilized self-reports of life
 events and adjustment (anxiety and depres-
 sion) in a 5-month prospective study of sev-
 enth and eighth graders. After controlling for
 Time 1 adjustment, Time 2 stressful events
 failed to predict Time 2 adjustment. In a
 study with a larger sample of seventh and
 eighth graders, Cohen et al. (1987) found
 that after controlling for Time 1 adjustment,

 Time 2 controllable events, but not un-
 controllable events, significantly predicted
 Time 2 adjustment, but Time 1 events had
 no effect on Time 2 adjustment. Compas et
 al. (1989), however, did find significant ef-
 fects for Time 1 stressful events on the sub-
 sequent adjustment of 10-15-year-olds, but
 the percentage of variance explained was
 only 2%.

 ables from baseline levels. However, find-
 ings of significant relations between changes
 in these variables and changes in adjustment
 are open to a reverse causal explanation (i.e.,
 changes in adjustment may cause changes in
 events or social support). The present study
 allows for the examination of both prospec-
 tive relations and whether changes in stress-
 ors and resources are related to changes in
 adjustment.

 In addition, the prospective studies re-

 viewed above focused primarily on the con-
 tribution of stressful life events and other
 risk factors, rather than resources (for excep-
 tions, see Burt, Cohen, and Bjorck [1988]
 and Glyshaw, Cohen, and Towbes [1989]).
 As noted by Compas (1987), if we are to un-
 derstand processes enhancing positive de-
 velopment and preventing maladjustment,
 we must examine resources available to
 cope with stressors. The present study fo-
 cused on two such resources reviewed by
 Compas (1987): social support and social
 problem-solving skills.

 Social support has been described by
 Cobb (1976) as information leading the indi-
 vidual to perceive that he or she is cared for,
 esteemed, and valued by members of his or
 her social network. Barrera (1986) has de-
 fined three separate elements of social sup-
 port: perceived support, or an appraisal that
 one's network values and cares for the indi-
 vidual; social embeddedness, or the quan-
 tity and identity of network members; and
 enacted support, or actual supportive behav-
 iors provided by network members. Sarason,
 Shearin, Pierce, and Sarason (1987) pre-
 sented data suggesting that these measures
 all assess the extent to which one feels cared
 for and accepted.

 Studies of children's social support have

 examined two models of the role of this re-
 source variable: the main effect model hy-
 pothesizes a direct relation between social
 support and adjustment, whereas the buf-
 fering model hypothesizes an interaction be-
 tween stress and social support such that
 high levels of social support moderate the
 negative effects of stress on adjustment (Co-
 hen & Wills, 1985). Compas (1987) notes that
 studies of youngsters show strong support
 for a direct relation between social support
 and adjustment, suggesting a generalized
 beneficial effect of social support, regardless
 of level of stressors. In contrast, only a few
 studies have found that stressors interacted
 significantly with social support in pre-
 dicting adjustment, and these interactions

 These results call into question any

 strong etiological effect of stressful life
 events on subsequent adjustment in chil-
 dren and adolescents. A few aspects of these
 studies should be highlighted. In terms of
 the data analysis strategies, Cohen et al.
 (1987) describe two approaches commonly
 followed in prospective stressful life events
 research and the problems inherent in each
 approach. The "longitudinal approach" as-
 sesses the relation between Time 2 events
 (events occurring within the past several
 months but assessed at Time 2) and Time 2
 adjustment after controlling for Time 1 ad-
 justment; this approach examines the ability
 of Time 2 stressors to predict change in ad-
 justment from Time 1 to Time 2. However,
 it is possible that some third variable (e.g.,
 disturbed parent-child relations) actually
 causes both stressors and adjustment. In ad-
 dition, a reverse causal explanation is pos-
 sible; changes in adjustment may cause
 changes in stressors. The second approach,
 the "prospective approach," examines the
 relation between Time 1 stressors and Time
 2 adjustment after controlling for Time 1 ad-
 justment. This approach tests the effect of
 Time 1 stressors on change in adjustment
 and may be useful if one is attempting to
 examine whether events occurring at one
 point in time place an individual at risk for
 adjustment difficulties at some future date.
 This approach is not vulnerable to a reverse
 causal explanation due to the temporal se-
 quence of the variables being measured.
 However, the prospective design is still vul-
 nerable to a third variable explanation. In
 addition, exposure to events is unlikely to
 be static; both initial exposure to stressors
 and subsequent changes in the level of
 stressful events may be more important in
 predicting changes over time in adjustment
 than simply initial level of stressors (see
 Caspi, Bolger, & Eckenrode, 1987). Holahan
 and Moos (1981) studied the contributions
 of changes over time in stressors and social
 support to predicting changes over time in
 adults' adjustment and found support for the
 notion that the critical aspect of stressors or
 resources may be the change in these vari-

 dren and adolescents. Those studies that
 have been conducted have focused primar-
 ily on the contribution of stressful events at
 either Time 1 or Time 2 to predicting change
 in adjustment, and the samples were primar-
 ily comprised of older children (sixth grad-
 ers and older). The present study examines
 both prospective effects for stressful life
 events and two resource variables (social
 support and social problem-solving skills),
 as well as whether changes in stressors and
 resources might predict changes in elemen-
 tary school children's behavioral and aca-
 demic adjustment. In the present study, we
 attempted to avoid the potential confound-
 ing of shared method variance by collecting
 data on stressors, resources, and adjustment
 from separate sources (parents, children, and
 teachers).

 accounted for relatively modest amounts of
 variance in comparison to the main effects
 of social support (e.g., Dubow & Tisak, 1989;
 Wertlieb, Weigel, & Feldstein, 1987).

 Researchers have also found that sup-

 port from different sources (e.g., family,
 peers, teachers) may be differentially related
 to adjustment. Hartup (1978) suggests that
 peers and adults may provide different sup-
 port functions, thus influencing different
 outcome variables. Cauce, Felner, and Pri-
 mavera (1982) found that family support
 was related to higher scholastic self-concept,
 whereas peer support was related to higher
 peer self-concept. However, in a 5-month
 prospective study of seventh and eighth
 graders, Burt et al. (1988) failed to find sig-
 nificant main or stress-buffering longitudinal
 effects for perceived family environment
 characteristics (e.g., cohesion, expressive-
 ness) on anxiety and depression. These stud-
 ies suggest the need to consider the contri-
 butions of different sources of support to
 predicting adjustment.

 Method
 Subjects and Procedures

 Social problem-solving skills have also

 been examined as a resource or coping vari-
 able among children (e.g., Asarnow, Carlson,
 & Guthrie, 1987; Compas, Malcarne, & Fon-
 dacaro, 1988; Dubow & Tisak, 1989). Social
 problem solving typically refers to the abil-
 ity to generate alternative solutions to social
 interaction problems, evaluate the possible
 consequences, and choose the most effective
 solution to the problem (Spivack, Platt, &
 Shure, 1976). Deficits in social problem-
 solving skills are related to poor adjustment
 in elementary school children (Tisdelle &
 St. Lawrence, 1986). For example, Dubow
 and Tisak (1989) found that a composite so-
 cial problem-solving score (taking into ac-
 count both the number of solutions and their
 effectiveness) was directly related to teacher
 and parent ratings of children's behavioral
 adjustment and grade-point averages. Fur-
 ther, social problem-solving abilities moder-
 ated the effects of stressful life events on
 teacher- and parent-rated behavior problems
 and grade-point average. Glyshaw et al.
 (1989) found that among junior high school
 students, less reliance on problem-solving
 coping strategies significantly predicted de-
 pression 5 months later. More prospective
 studies are needed to examine how changes
 in social problem solving may be related to
 changes in adjustment over time.

 In the Spring of 1987 (Time 1), children
 in third- through fifth-grade classrooms (N
 = 655) from two urban and two suburban
 lower-middle-class schools were requested
 to take home to their parents letters describ-
 ing the study and consent forms. Parental
 permission to participate was obtained for
 361 children. Data collected from the chil-
 dren, their parents, and teachers comprised
 the first wave of the current study (Dubow
 & Tisak, 1989). At Time 1, the subjects were
 137 third graders, 124 fourth graders, and
 100 fifth graders. The sample consisted of
 195 girls and 166 boys; 73% of the children
 were white, 21% were black, 5% were His-
 panic, and 1% were "other." The children
 completed paper-and-pencil measures in
 their classrooms during three 45-min ses-
 sions. The measures were administered by
 two trained research assistants, one of whom
 read the questions aloud, while the other
 checked that the children were following di-
 rections, not skipping ahead, etc. Question-
 naires were mailed to parents; 240 (66%) of
 the parents returned the measures, 91% of
 which were completed by mothers. Chil-
 dren whose parents did versus did not return
 questionnaires were relatively similar in
 terms of demographic and adjustment vari-
 ables (Dubow & Tisak, 1989). Teachers also
 provided information on the children's ad-
 justment (95% return rate). Parents and
 teachers received a $10 honorarium for com-
 pleting the measures.

 This review indicates that relatively few

 prospective studies have examined the roles
 of stressors and resource variables for chil-

 In the Spring of 1989 (Time 2), an at-

 tempt was made to relocate as many of the
 children in the original sample as possible

 for a follow-up study. The interval between
 Time 1 and Time 2 was selected as 2 years
 in order to allow for changes to occur in the
 stress, resource, and adjustment variables
 from middle to late childhood, a develop-
 mental period of significant cognitive and
 social growth (Gardner, 1982). The original
 schools were contacted, and children were
 tracked by matching the classroom rosters
 from Time 1 with the schools' current rec-
 ords and with the central administration's
 records for children who could not be lo-
 cated. Parental consent was obtained for 193
 (53%) of the original sample. Follow-up data
 were not available for 79 subjects (22%) who
 had moved, 77 (21%) who did not return con-
 sent forms, and 12 (3%) who declined partic-
 ipation. This attrition rate is within the range
 one would expect given those reported in
 other recent longitudinal studies (Compas,
 Wagner, Slavin, & Vannatta, 1986; Stein-
 berg, Elmen, & Mounts, 1989). The follow-
 up sample of 193 children consisted of 74
 fifth graders, 61 sixth graders, and 58 sev-
 enth graders; 114 of these children were
 girls, and 78% were white (17% were black,
 and 5% were Hispanic). Eleven percent of
 the children (n = 22) transferred to junior
 high school in the past year, 16% (n = 31)
 transferred to middle school in the past year,
 and 19% (n = 36) transferred to middle
 school 2 years ago.1

 The children completed paper-and-

 pencil measures in their classrooms during
 one 60-min session, administered in the
 same manner as at Time 1. Questionnaires
 were mailed to parents; 146 (76%) of the par-
 ents returned the measures, 92% of which
 were completed by mothers. Only one dif-
 ference was found between children whose
 parents did and did not return question-
 naires: children whose parents did not re-
 turn questionnaires had higher levels of
 teacher-rated problems, F(1,192) = 6.48, p
 < .05. As in the first wave, teachers also pro-
 vided information about the children's ad-
 justment (100% return rate). Again, parents
 and teachers received a $10 honorarium for
 participating.

 For the sample that participated at Time

 2, parental marital status was as follows:

 married (66%), divorced/separated (18%),
 remarried (7%), and other (9%). Median fam-
 ily income was $30,000, with approximately
 one-third of the sample at or below $20,000.
 Mean parental education, assessed along
 Hollingshead's (see Miller, 1977) 7-point
 scale (1 = graduate/professional training, 7
 = less than 7th grade), was 3.10 (SD = 1.29),
 reflecting a level of education between high
 school graduate and partial college. Mean
 occupational attainment using Hollings-
 head's 7-point occupation dimension (1 =
 major professionals, 7 = unskilled employ-
 ees) was 4.30 (SD = 1.80), reflecting a level
 of occupation between skilled manual em-
 ployee and clerical/sales worker. Using Hol-
 lingshead's index of social position (Miller,
 1977), mean socioeconomic status was 43.20
 (SD = 15.72) (Level III), reflecting lower-
 middle-class status. Mean number of chil-
 dren in the family was 2.43 (SD = .99).

 In terms of the effects of subject attri-
 tion, in comparison to the sample who only
 participated at Time 1, the subsample who
 also participated at Time 2 was more likely
 to be composed of females, X2(1) = 4.74, p
 < .05, white children, X2(1) = 4.11, p < .05,
 and families of higher socioeconomic status,
 F(1,237) = 4.74, p < .05. The subsample
 who participated in both waves of the study
 were also exposed to fewer cumulative
 stressful life events, F(1,239) = 19.38, p <
 .01, and exhibited better adjustment in terms
 of higher grade-point averages, F(1,348) =
 8.73, p < .01, lower levels of teacher-rated
 behavior problems, F(1,343) = 15.35, p <
 .01, and higher levels of teacher-rated com-
 petencies, F(1,328) = 15.22, p < .05. The
 fact that the subsample who participated in
 both waves of the study was generally better
 adjusted than the subsample who partici-
 pated only in the first wave is consistent
 with other large-scale longitudinal studies
 (e.g., Lefkowitz, Eron, Walder, & Hues-
 mann, 1977).
 Measures

 1. Child measures.-(a) The Social Sup-
 port Appraisals Scale (Dubow & Ullman,
 1989) was administered at Time 1. This
 31-item scale assesses the child's appraisals
 of peer, family, and teacher support. Items

 1 Supplementary analyses were conducted to examine the effect of the normative school

 transition. Complete Time 1 and Time 2 child, parent, and teacher data were available for only
 11 students who transferred to junior high school in the past year, 20 who transferred to middle
 school in the past year, and 21 who transferred to middle school 2 years ago. Hierarchical
 regressions predicting Time 2 adjustment revealed that those students who transferred in the
 past year showed significant decreases in grade-point average, but no effects on behavioral
 adjustment were found. No significant longitudinal findings emerged for the block of interaction
 terms involving school transfer and the stress and resource variables.

 b) The children's social problem-solv-
 ing skills were assessed using a procedure
 developed by Deluty (1981). At Time 1, chil-
 dren were read 10 vignettes depicting con-
 flict situations involving peers and parents.
 For each vignette, children were given 4
 min to "write down all the things you really
 might say or do if you found yourself in this
 situation." A sample vignette is, "You're
 standing in line for a drink of water. A kid
 your age and size walks over and just shoves
 you out of line. What would you do?"

 were developed to reflect Cobb's (1976) con-
 compared the 2-year stability of a scale
 ceptualization of social support: information
 formed using the overlapping 27 items and
 indicating to the individual that he or she is

 whether the child feels left out by his
 friends), family items (e.g., whether the
 child is an important member of his family),
 and teacher items (e.g., whether the child
 feels his teachers are good to ask for help or
 advice about problems). The following sam-
 ple item illustrates the format of each item:
 "Some kids feel left out by their friends, but
 other kids don't. Do you feel left out by your
 friends?" The child responds to each item
 on a 5-point continuum (1 = always, 5 =
 never). Dubow and Ullman (1989) reported
 an internal consistency reliability (Cron-
 bach's alpha) of .88 and 3-4 week test-retest
 reliability of .75. Factor analyses supported
 a three-factor solution: family support (11
 items, coefficient alpha = .82), peer support
 (15 items, alpha = .83), and teacher support
 (5 items, alpha = .78). Moderate intercorre-
 lations were obtained among the three sub-
 scales formed based on the factors. Validity
 data for this measure (Dubow & Ullman,
 1989) include: (1) correlations were moder-
 ate to high with the corresponding subscales
 of Harter's (1985) social support scale for
 children, (2) peer support correlated signifi-
 cantly with a measure of loneliness and peer
 nominations of social preference, and (3)
 social support correlated moderately with
 self-esteem, consistent with the notion that
 perceived social support provides the indi-
 vidual with information that he or she is val-
 ued by others (Cobb, 1976).

 Scoring of the children's responses fol-
 lowed procedures developed by Lochman
 and Lampron (1986) and modified by Du-
 bow and Tisak (1989). The first author and a
 graduate student trained three undergradu-
 ate students to rate the number of solutions
 given to each vignette, the content category
 of each solution (e.g., Verbal/Physical Ag-
 gression, Verbal Assertion/Direct Action),
 and the effectiveness of each solution (a
 4-point rating ranging from 1 = immediate
 action that escalates the conflict, to 4 = so-
 cially appropriate resolution). After training
 the undergraduates to a level of 85% exact
 agreement with the graduate student (crite-
 rion judge) on practice protocols, 15% of the
 actual study protocols were rated by all four
 judges. Exact agreement with the criterion
 judge on whether each response in fact con-
 stituted a scorable solution was 98% for each
 rater; percent of exact agreement with the
 criterion judge on the content of each solu-
 tion ranged from 89% to 91% across raters;
 and correlations of each rater's effectiveness
 ratings with those of the criterion judge
 ranged from r = .87 to r = .90 across judges.
 Dubow and Tisak (1989) examined sev-
 eral possible scores based on the problem-
 solving measure (i.e., total number of solu-
 tions, mean effectiveness of each solution,
 content category scores, and a composite
 score). The social problem-solving compos-
 ite score (SPS Composite) was derived as
 follows: for each of the 10 vignettes, the ef-
 fectiveness ratings for all of the child's solu-
 tions to that vignette were summed, yielding
 10 scores; the mean of these 10 scores was
 the SPS Composite score. (Coefficient alpha
 for these 10 scores was .85.) The SPS Com-
 posite score was viewed as the best sum-

 cial Support Appraisals Scale was admin-
 istered. This 41-item revision included 10
 new items assessing teacher and classmate
 support. Four of the original items were also
 reworded in the reverse direction. The in-
 ternal consistency of the total revised scale
 was .93, and a similar three-factor solution
 emerged as with the original version of the
 scale (19 peer items, coefficient alpha = .88;
 12 family items, alpha = .92; and 10 teacher
 items, alpha = .86).

 At Time 2, a revised version of the So-

 lag correlations was almost identical if one

 mary measure because it was moderately to
 highly related to all other problem-solving
 scores and it is based on both the total num-
 ber of solutions given to a vignette and the
 effectiveness ratings. Other investigators
 (e.g., Fischler & Kendall, 1988; Richard &
 Dodge, 1982) have demonstrated the need
 to consider simultaneously the number of
 solutions as well as their effectiveness.

 Because the schools placed the time

 constraint of meeting with the children for
 only one session at Time 2, only five of the
 original 10 vignettes were administered (the
 odd-numbered items). One graduate student
 and two undergraduate students used the
 same rating procedure as described for Time
 1. Agreement with the criterion judge on
 whether each response was a scorable solu-
 tion was 92% for each rater; agreement with
 the criterion judge on content category clas-
 sification for each solution was 85% and
 91%; and correlations of effectiveness rat-
 ings between the criterion judge and each
 rater were r = .95 and r = .97, respectively.
 Effectiveness ratings for all of the child's so-
 lutions to a given vignette were summed,
 and a mean of these five scores served as the
 SPS Composite score. (Coefficient alpha for
 these five scores was .87.)

 loss of job by parent). The events included
 by Sandler and Block (1979) on this list were
 selected because they are likely to be out-
 side of the child's control and thus are less
 likely to be confounded with the child's ad-
 justment. Although several different scores
 can be derived from this measure (i.e., a sim-
 ple count of all 32 events experienced, a
 simple count of the 19 negative events or
 the three positive events-10 events were
 judged as ambiguous with regard to valence,
 and a sum of weights assigned to each of the
 negative and positive events reflecting the
 presumed amount of life readjustment re-
 quired), research (Dubow & Tisak, 1989;
 Sandler & Block, 1979) suggests that a sim-
 ple count of the total number of experienced
 events correlates most highly with adjust-
 ment indices. This score was used in the
 present study.

 c) The Revised Behavior Problem
 Checklist (Quay & Peterson, 1983) is an
 89-item measure that assesses several types
 of behavior problems (i.e., aggression, anxi-
 ety, attention problems). The parent indi-
 cates the degree to which each behavior is a
 problem for his or her child along a 3-point
 continuum (0 = not a problem, 2 = severe
 problem). A total problem score was calcu-
 lated to reflect the sum of the parent's scores
 for each behavior problem (Cronbach's al-
 pha = .97 at Time 1, and .96 at Time 2).
 3. Teacher measures.-(a) At Time 1,
 the Teacher-Child Rating Scale (T-CRS;
 Hightower et al., 1986) was completed by
 teachers. The T-CRS consists of an 18-item
 Problem Behavior Scale (acting-out, shy,
 learning problems) and a 25-item Compe-
 tent Behavior Scale (frustration tolerance,
 task orientation, assertiveness). Teachers
 rate the degree to which the child exhibits
 each behavior along a 5-point continuum.
 Hightower et al. (1986) reported internal
 consistencies ranging from .85 to .95 across
 subscales for different samples, and moder-
 ate intercorrelations with other measures of
 children's adjustment.

 Regarding the similarity between the
 10-vignette version and the shortened five-
 vignette version, the correlation between
 the SPS Composite score based on the five
 odd-numbered vignettes at Time 1 and the
 SPS Composite score based on the five
 even-numbered vignettes at Time 1 was r =
 .75. Also, the cross-lag correlations compar-
 ing the 2-year stability of the SPS Composite
 score based on the shortened scale with the
 correlation between the Time 1 and Time 2
 total SPS Composite scores were identical (r
 = .36).

 2. Parent measures.-(a) Hollingshead's
 Two-Factor Index of Social Position (Miller,
 1977) was used to compute socioeconomic
 status. Higher scores indicate lower levels
 of socioeconomic status.

 At Time 2, the revised version of this

 b) Stressful life events were assessed us-
 ing Sandler and Block's (1979) modified ver-
 sion of Coddington's Life Events Scale for
 Children. Coddington (1972) included items
 culled from the literature and judged by
 teachers, pediatricians, and mental health
 professionals as requiring readjustment for
 the elementary school-age child. The parent

 child's life within the past year (e.g., child

 scale was used (Hightower, Spinell, & Lo-
 tyczewski, 1988). In this version, only the
 Competent Behavior Scale was slightly
 modified (addition of a new subscale, dele-
 tion of a few original items); nevertheless,
 15 items are repeated on both the original
 and revised versions. Analyses showed that
 at each point in time, correlations between
 a subscale comprised of the original 15 items
 and the total scale were r = .99. In addition,

 tween the original scale at Time 1 and the
 revised scale at Time 2 were identical (r =

 havior Scale was .95, and for the Competent
 Behavior Scale .96.

 tered in the first step of the hierarchical re-
 gression equation predicting the Time 2 cri-
 terion measure. In the second step, Time 1
 stressful life events and resources were en-
 tered, testing the prospective effects of these
 variables. In step 3, Time 2 stressful life
 events and resources were entered. Sig-
 nificant findings at this step suggest that
 changes in the predictors over time are re-
 lated to concomitant changes in adjustment
 over time, because significant findings rep-
 resent the residual effects of the predictor
 variables after controlling for the earlier lev-
 els of the predictor and criterion variables
 (see Holahan & Moos, 1981). As a final step,
 the interaction terms of Time 2 stressful life
 events with Time 2 social support and with
 Time 2 SPS Composite were entered as a
 test of the hypothesis that the resource vari-
 ables might moderate the relation between
 stressors and adjustment over time.
 Descriptive Statistics

 Table 1 shows the means and standard

 deviations for the stressful life events, re-
 source, and adjustment variables at Time 1
 and Time 2. A series of repeated-measures
 ANOVAs was computed in order to examine
 group change over time in these variables.
 Thus, only those children with both Time 1
 and Time 2 data for a given variable were
 included in computing the descriptive statis-
 tics for that variable at both points in time. A
 Bonferroni correction was computed setting
 the familywise error rate at .10, yielding a
 comparisonwise error rate of .01. Children's
 grade-point averages significantly decreased
 over time, F(1,187) = 23.48, p < .001; it is
 unclear whether this reflects a true develop-
 mental trend or if teachers are perhaps em-

 Results

 Overview of Data Analyses

 First, descriptive statistics were com-

 puted for the stress, resource, and ad-
 justment variables at both points in time.
 Second, cross-sectional correlations were ex-
 amined. Third, we computed zero-order
 cross-lag correlations between the Time 1
 and Time 2 variables. In order to control for
 the Type I error rate given the large number
 of correlations being computed, a multistage
 Bonferroni procedure was applied to the cor-
 relation matrices (see Larzelere & Mulaik,
 1977). Following these authors, correlations
 that were also significant at the conventional
 p < .05 level are noted as "borderline sig-
 nificant" to facilitate comparisons with other
 studies.

 Finally, a hierarchical regression model
 was employed to analyze both prospective
 relations of stressful life events and re-
 sources (social support and social problem-
 solving skills) and whether changes in these
 variables related to concomitant changes in
 adjustment. Demographic variables and the
 Time 1 adjustment (criterion) score were en-

 ploying more stringent grading policies at
 higher grade levels. In addition, parent-
 rated behavior problems significantly de-
 creased over time, F(1,129) = 9.28, p < .01.
 Next, we compared our descriptive sta-

 teacher-rated behaviors (r = .53 for prob-
 lems, r = .56 for competencies), and high
 levels of stability were obtained for grade-
 point average (r = .70) and parent-rated be-
 havior problems (r = .82).

 tistics with normative data that were avail-
 able for the Life Events Scale (Sandler &
 Block, 1979), the Teacher-Child Rating
 Scale (Hightower et al., 1986, 1988), and the
 Revised Behavior Problem Checklist (Quay
 & Peterson, 1984). T tests revealed no differ-
 ences between the normative and current
 samples on the Life Events Scale, the T-CRS
 subscales (examined separately by sex and
 geographic location), or the Revised Behav-
 ior Problem Checklist (examined separately
 by age and sex).
 Cross-sectional Relations

 Time 1.-Only those subjects who par-
 ticipated in the study at Time 1 and Time 2
 are included in these analyses. Table 2 (be-
 low the diagonal) presents cross-sectional
 correlations among the Time 1 variables. Of
 particular interest, higher levels of stressful
 events were related to lower levels of adjust-
 ment, and higher levels of social support and
 social problem-solving skills (SPS Compos-
 ite) were related to higher levels of adjust-
 ment (r's in the .30 range). Table 2 also
 shows that whereas grade level was not as-
 sociated with adjustment, sex, race, and so-
 cioeconomic status were: females, white
 children, and children from higher so-
 cioeconomic status backgrounds exhibited
 higher levels of adjustment.

 Table 3 (below diagonal) shows the

 zero-order cross-lag correlations of the Time
 1 variables with the Time 2 measures.
 Higher levels of stressful life events at Time
 1 were modestly related to lower levels of
 behavioral and academic adjustment 2 years
 later (r's ranged from .18 to .29), and higher
 levels of social support and the SPS Com-
 posite at Time 1 were modestly predictive
 of higher levels of adjustment at Time 2. Re-
 sults above the diagonal in Table 3 show that
 some of the Time 1 adjustment measures
 were modestly related to Time 2 stressors
 and the SPS Composite, suggesting the pos-
 sibility of bidirectional relations between
 stressors and resources on the one hand and
 adjustment indices on the other.
 Hierarchical Regressions: Relations of
 Stressors and Resources with Adjustment
 Predictors of adjustment.-As noted
 earlier, a hierarchical regression model was
 used to analyze both prospective effects for
 stressful life events and resources, and
 whether changes in these variables relate to
 changes in adjustment. Four sets of hierar-
 chical regressions were computed, one for
 each Time 2 adjustment measure. Cross-
 sectional correlations at both Time 1 and
 Time 2, as presented in Table 2, showed
 moderate to high relations among the adjust-
 ment indices. Despite this magnitude of re-
 lations, all four criterion measures were ex-
 amined separately due to both conceptual
 distinctions among the variables and for con-
 sistency with previous research (Dubow &
 Tisak, 1989).

 Time 2.-Table 2 (above the diagonal)

 presents intercorrelations of the variables at
 Time 2. Stressful life events and the re-
 source variables were generally modestly re-
 lated to the adjustment indices. Sex, race,
 and socioeconomic status, but not grade
 level, showed some degree of relation to at
 least one adjustment measure. Thus, sex,
 race, and socioeconomic status were re-
 tained as background variables in later re-
 gression analyses.
 Cross-Lag Correlations

 The values along the diagonal in Table
 3 show a moderate degree of stability over
 2 years in stressful life events (r = .49), so-
 cial support (r = .38), and social problem-
 solving skills (SPS Composite) (r = .36).
 Moderate stability was also obtained for

 Table 4 shows that in step 1, the demo-

 graphic variables and the appropriate Time
 1 criterion variable accounted for between
 24% and 74% of the variance across Time 2
 adjustment indices. The background vari-
 able that contributed the most to predicting
 each Time 2 adjustment measure was the
 child's score on the corresponding Time 1
 criterion variable.2

 In step 2, the Time 1 set of stressful life

 events and resource variables accounted for
 an additional 3% to 5% of the variance across

 2 Following other prospective studies (e.g., Cohen et al., 1987), we examined whether sex
 interacted with the stress and resource variables in predicting adjustment. No significant longitu-
 dinal findings emerged for the block of interaction terms of sex and these variables in predicting
 any of the four adjustment measures.

 the four Time 1 adjustment measures was
 entered; the additional Time 1 predictors
 were also entered (e.g., Time 1 stress and
 social support in the regression predicting
 Time 2 SPS Composite) for statistical control
 of these variables and to maintain consis-
 tency between these regressions and those
 described in the previous section. Signifi-
 cant results for the Time 1 adjustment mea-
 sure in this step would lend support for the
 causal role of early adjustment. In the third
 step, the Time 2 predictors were entered,
 including the corresponding Time 2 adjust-
 ment measure; significant results for the
 Time 2 adjustment measure would indicate
 that changes in adjustment over time are re-
 lated to changes in the criterion over time.
 For each of the three criterion variables, four
 regressions were computed, one for each ad-
 justment measure. The results of these 12
 regression analyses are not presented in a
 table.

 In the first step, the Time 1 criterion was
 consistently related to the Time 2 criterion.
 In the second step, only one prospective ef-
 fect was found across the 12 analyses: Time
 1 parent-rated problems was a significant
 predictor of change in stressful life events
 (beta = .20, p < .05, R2 for step = .04,
 F[3,100] = 1.44, N.S.). In the third step,
 only two of the Time 2 adjustment measures
 were significant predictors of social support:
 teacher-rated problems (beta = -.27, p <
 .05; R2 for step = .07, F[(3,98] = 2.55, p <
 .10) and teacher-rated competencies (beta =
 .37, p < .01; R2 for step = .14, F[3,93] =
 5.18, p < .01). Only Time 2 teacher-rated
 problems was a significant predictor of SPS
 Composite (beta = -.25, p < .05; R2 for step
 = .09, F[3,98] = 3.13, p < .05).

 adjustment measures. Because the blocks of
 these Time 1 variables were not significant,
 caution should be taken in examining any
 variables that were significant within the
 blocks. However, because prospective find-
 ings over a 2-year time period are somewhat
 uncommon, those found will be noted:
 higher levels of initial social support (total
 score) predicted higher grade-point avei-
 ages, and higher levels of initial family sup-
 port predicted higher levels of teacher-rated
 competencies.

 In step 3, Table 4 shows that the set of

 Time 2 predictors accounted for an addi-
 tional 13% to 22% of the variance in Time
 2 adjustment. Specifically, increases in so-
 cial support (total score and peer support)
 and social problem-solving skills (SPS Com-
 posite) were related to improvement in
 teacher-rated problems and competencies,
 and grade-point average; and increases
 in family support predicted increases in
 teacher-rated competencies. Increases in so-
 cial problem solving (but not social support)
 predicted improvement in parent-rated be-
 havior problems. Changes in stressful life
 events were unrelated to changes in ad-
 justment.3

 In the final step of the hierarchical re-
 gressions (not shown in Table 4), no signifi-
 cant findings emerged for the interaction
 terms of Time 2 stressful events x Time 2
 social support and Time 2 stressful events x
 Time 2 SPS Composite in predicting any of
 the adjustment indices.

 Prediction of stress 1and resource vari-

 ables.-Findings that changes in the stress
 and resource variables are related to changes
 in adjustment are open to a reverse causal
 explanation, and some studies with adoles-
 cents support such an explanation (Compas
 et al., 1986, 1989). Thus, three additional
 sets of hierarchical multiple regressions
 were computed, using the same approach as
 in the previous analyses; however, in these
 regressions, the criterion variables were
 Time 2 stress, social support, and SPS Com-
 posite. In the first step, sex, race, socioeco-
 nomic status, and the Time 1 criterion vari-
 able (e.g., Time 1 SPS Composite in the
 regression predicting Time 2 SPS Compos-
 ite) were entered. In the second step, one of

 Discussion

 Few prospective studies of stressful life

 events and resource variables have been
 conducted with children and adolescents,
 and those that have been conducted have
 generally focused on older children. This
 study examined both prospective effects of
 stressors and resources (social support and
 social problem-solving skills), as well as
 whether changes over time in stressors and
 resources were related to changes over time

 3 The significant effect for Time 2 stressful life events on Time 2 teacher-rated competencies
 is due to a suppression effect, indicated by a reversal of the sign of the beta weight in the
 regression equation, after controlling for other variables, compared to the sign of the zero-order
 correlation between the predictor and criterion variables. Glyshaw et al. (1989) note that suppres-
 sion effects are sometimes encountered in multivariate stress research.

 event, continuously taxing the individual's
 coping efforts.

 Dubow et al. 595

 Stressful Life Events

 Prospective analyses failed to support
 an etiological role of major stressful life
 events in determining later adjustment, and
 changes in stressful life events over 2 years
 were not predictive of changes in adjust-
 ment. This pattern of negative results is sim-
 ilar to the findings of Cohen et al. (1987),
 Gersten et al. (1977), and Swearingen and
 Cohen (1985). Gersten et al. (1977) posit that
 "stressful processes" such as chronically dis-
 turbed parent-child relations and sociocultu-
 ral disadvantage play causal roles in the oc-
 currence of both discrete events and the
 child's adjustment. Cohen et al. (1987) sug-
 gested that the many developmental tasks of
 early adolescence, including physical mat-
 uration, heightened conflict with parents
 regarding autonomy issues, increased im-
 portance of the peer group, and more chal-
 lenging academic tasks might overshadow
 the impact of an accumulation of specific
 events.

 It is also possible that the lack of sig-
 nificant prospective findings in the present
 study was in part due to the method of data
 collection. Separate informants provided in-
 formation on stressors and adjustment. In
 the Compas et al. (1989) study, adolescent
 self-report of stressors was a significant pro-
 spective predictor of self-reported, but not
 mother-reported, adolescent maladjustment.
 Achenbach, McConaughy, and Howell
 (1987) suggested that the typically obtained
 modest correlations between reports of child
 adjustment provided by different sources are
 reflective of the different perspectives of
 these informants. It may well be that the in-
 fluence of certain variables on child adjust-
 ment depends on the salience of those vari-
 ables to the particular informant, or on the
 settings in which each informant observes
 the child. However, the lack of prospective
 effects for stressful life events on adjustment
 has been reported in studies in which the
 same informant provided data on both pre-
 dictor and criterion measures (e.g., Cohen et
 al., 1987; Gersten et al., 1977), as well as in
 the present study in which different infor-
 mants provided data on stressors and crite-
 rion measures.

 Finally, although initial stressors failed

 to predict later child adjustment, a prospec-
 tive effect was found for initial parent-rated
 child problems on later parent-rated stress-
 ful life events. While this finding might in
 part be accounted for by shared method vari-
 ance, it is also possible that the parents'
 experience of child behavior problems in-
 fluences the occurrence of later events such
 as marital difficulties and parental mental
 health problems.
 Resources: Social Support and Social
 Problem-Solving Skills

 Time 1 social support was a significant
 prospective predictor of GPA, and Time 1
 family support was a significant prospective
 predictor of teacher-rated competencies.
 Similarly, Steinberg et al. (1989) found that
 aspects of authoritative child rearing, includ-
 ing parental warmth and acceptance (anal-
 ogous to the concept of family support in
 the present study), made both direct and
 indirect contributions to child academic
 achievement over time. This parenting style
 affected child academic achievement pri-
 marily through the development of "psy-
 chosocial maturity" (e.g., aspirations for
 performing competent work, experiencing

 In contrast to the studies reporting no
 support for a causal role of stressful events,
 Compas et al. (1989) found that, among 10-
 15-year-olds, Time 1 stressful events added
 a modest but significant proportion of vari-
 ance (2%) in predicting Time 2 adjustment,
 after controlling for Time 1 adjustment.
 Whereas we used a measure of major dis-
 crete life events, Compas et al. used the Ad-
 olescent Perceived Events Scale (APES) to
 assess stressful events, which contains a
 large number of "daily hassles" (e.g., pres-
 sures or expectations by parents, arguments
 or fights between parents, getting good
 grades or progress reports). Daily hassles
 scales may actually reflect those stressful
 processes described by Cohen et al. (1987)
 and Gersten et al. (1977). Wagner, Compas,
 and Howell (1988) suggested that major
 events might influence adjustment indi-
 rectly-through their effect on daily stress-
 ors. For example, the authors point out that
 a major event such as parental divorce might
 engender a high level of daily hassles (e.g.,
 increase in child-care responsibilities, diffi-
 culty with finances), in turn influencing the
 child's adjustment. In a study of 58 older ad-
 olescents, Wagner et al. found support for
 the mediating role of daily hassles in the re-
 lation between major events and psychologi-
 cal symptoms, whereas major events failed
 to affect symptoms directly. The authors sug-
 gested that these daily stressors may remain
 more salient than the time-limited major

 pleasure in one's work, and development of
 initiative and a sense of control over events).
 The development of these intrapersonal
 qualities might enhance the child's aca-
 demic achievement over time as academic
 demands become more challenging and suc-
 cess experiences accumulate. Consistent
 with the prospective effect for family sup-
 port on competencies, Cauce and Srebnik
 (1989) found that family support showed
 more consistent relations with perceptions
 of competence than did peer support, pre-
 sumably because family members provide a
 wider range of support functions to the child
 or adolescent who is still dependent on the
 family. Early modeling of supportive behav-
 iors by family members may also provide the
 child with a sense of security and self-worth,
 as well as useful strategies for forming future
 relationships.

 The present study also found that in-
 creases in social support over 2 years pre-
 dicted improvement in teacher-rated be-
 havior problems, competencies, and GPA.
 Changes in peer support over time appeared
 to have the most consistent relations to
 changes in adjustment. This finding likely
 reflects the growing influence of peer rela-
 tions during later childhood and early ado-
 lescence. Hartup (1978) notes that the peer
 group influences the development of prob-
 lem-solving skills, appropriate modes of con-
 flict resolution, and negotiation skills. The
 development of positive peer relations
 might also influence both behavioral and ac-
 ademic adjustment through the processes of
 enhanced self-esteem and self-efficacy (San-
 dler, Miller, Short, & Wolchik, 1989).

 changes in adjustment. As suggested by Du-
 bow and Tisak (1989), it is possible that fam-
 ily and peers provide a broad range of sup-
 port functions across many situations, which
 may have more global effects on adjustment;
 teachers may be more often viewed as pro-
 viders of informational and tangible support
 specific to school-related concerns.

 The current study revealed no signifi-
 cant prospective effects for social problem-
 solving skills. However, positive changes
 in social problem-solving skills over time
 were related to positive changes in all four
 adjustment indices. Recall that the social
 problem-solving skills index was based on
 both number of solutions generated and
 their effectiveness. In a social problem-
 solving skills training program designed to
 help children adapt to the middle-school
 transition, Elias et al. (1986) found that posi-
 tive changes in problem-solving skills were
 related to reduced adjustment difficulties
 during the transition. Glyshaw et al. (1989)
 found that greater use of problem-solving
 strategies in junior high school students pre-
 dicted lower levels of depression 5 months
 later. Perhaps the development of social
 problem-solving skills (i.e., the ability to
 generate a range of effective solutions) cre-
 ates ongoing opportunities for mutually sat-
 isfying experiences with peers and adults.
 Because such skills are personal resources
 rather than resources that must be provided
 by others, it is likely that the child would
 use these skills to obtain successful out-
 comes across situations (adjustment mea-
 sures).

 Similar to the prospective effect for
 family support on teacher-rated competen-
 cies, change in family support over time was
 also related to change in teacher-rated com-
 petencies. If one assumes that the family is
 a critical training ground for modeling and
 learning strategies for the development of
 interpersonal relationships (Lefkowitz et al.,
 1977), changes in family support may pro-
 vide the child with more or less favorable
 modeling opportunities, which in turn may
 affect the child's social competence in the
 classroom (as rated by teachers in the pres-
 ent study). Changes in family support might
 also reflect changes in stressful family pro-
 cesses, which in turn might affect the child's
 social competence.

 No prospective effects were found for
 teacher support on adjustment, nor did
 changes in teacher support over time predict

 This study found no longitudinal stress-
 buffering effects for social support or social
 problem solving on adjustment. Theoreti-
 cally, these resources should be more useful
 to the highly stressed individual, providing
 him or her with feelings of self-worth and
 mastery in the face of stressors. In the child
 and adolescent literature, there is only
 mixed support for the buffering effect of so-
 cial support (see Compas, 1987). Cohen and
 Wills (1985) suggest that for social support
 to act as a stress buffer, there needs to be a
 match between the type of stressor (e.g.,
 move to a new school) and the type of sup-
 port (e.g., teacher support concerning the
 new school's social and academic demands).
 Similarly, specific types of social problem-
 solving strategies may be more suited to cop-
 ing with specific stressors (Compas et al.,
 1988). Previous studies of children, includ-
 ing the present one, have not used stressor-
 specific measures of perceived support or

 specific types of resources.

 Overall, there were few prospective ef-

 refined to reflect how subjects match specific
 types of resources with specific types of
 stressors. Comparisons among studies also
 highlight the importance of collecting data
 from multiple sources. Finally, the pattern

 becomes increasingly aggressive over time,
 peers may begin to reject the child, resulting
 in lower levels of social support. Expecting
 peer rejection, the child may begin to use
 less effective social problem-solving strate-
 gies when placed in potential conflict situa-
 tions.

 Several limitations of the present study

 Limitations and Conclusions

 should be addressed. First, despite the pro-
 spective design of the study, its correlational
 approach limits definitive conclusions re-
 garding causality. No correlational prospec-
 tive field study, regardless of the statistical
 procedures used to analyze the data (e.g.,
 longitudinal vs. prospective analyses; Co-
 hen et al., 1987), can definitively indicate
 causality. Such studies must be followed up
 by experimental and quasi-experimental de-
 signs in which levels of resources are ma-
 nipulated in groups experiencing high and
 low levels of stressful events. Interventions
 might involve the provision of social support
 or the training of social problem-solving
 skills (e.g., increasing one's repertoire of ef-
 fective solutions) for children experiencing
 different levels of stressful life events.

 cents: Structural components and adaptive

 chology, 10, 417-428.

 Another limitation of the present study
 is a problem inherent in prospective field
 research: subject attrition. Typically, those
 subjects experiencing more stress and exhib-
 iting lower levels of adjustment are more
 likely to be lost from the sample at follow-up
 than their counterparts (see Lefkowitz et al.,
 1977). In the current study, the relative loss
 of subjects experiencing higher levels of
 stressors may have reduced the likelihood of
 finding stress-buffering effects.

 The findings of this and other prospec-

 tive studies of youngsters should alert re-
 searchers to select their measures of stress-
 ors and resources carefully. Evidence is
 accumulating that chronic daily hassles may
 play a mediating role in the relation be-
 tween discrete major life events and adjust-
 ment, necessitating the collection of mea-
 sures assessing both types of stressors. In
 addition, measures of resources need to be
