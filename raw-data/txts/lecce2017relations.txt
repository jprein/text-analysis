Relations Between Theory of Mind and Executive Function in Middle Childhood: a Short-

Term Longitudinal Study 

Abstract 

Studies with preschool children have shown significant links between children’s 

executive function (EF) and theory of mind (ToM), but few studies have examined these 

associations in primary school children. In order to address this gap we designed a three-

wave cross-lagged longitudinal study in which we followed a group of 113 children (61 boys) 

across three time points from age 9.5 to 10.5 years (mean age at time 1 M = 112.3 months, 

SD = 4.18 months; mean age at Time 2 M = 118.3 months, SD = 4.15 months and mean age 

at Time 3 M = 124.7 months, SD = 4.06 months). At each time point we measured EF 

(working memory and inhibitory control), ToM and language. Our analyses showed (i) 

moderate rank-order stability of individual differences in both EF and ToM and (ii) growth in 

ToM task performance across time. Cross-lagged longitudinal analyses revealed an 

asymmetric developmental relation between ToM and working memory. Early working 

memory predicted later ToM but not vice versa. Our results suggest a specific role for 

working memory in the on-going development of ToM in middle childhood.

Relations Between Theory of Mind and Executive Function in Middle Childhood: a Short-

Term Longitudinal Study 

The ability to infer others’ mental states or ‘theory of mind’ (ToM) has long 

fascinated researchers from a wide range of disciplines.  Individual differences in children’s 

ToM are striking and related to important social (Banerjee, Watling, & Caputi, 2011) and 

cognitive outcomes (Lecce, Caputi, & Hughes, 2011).  Specifically, children who excel in 

reasoning about others’ mental states are better equipped to face the demands of formal 

schooling, as they are more academically able (Blair & Razza, 2007; Lecce, Caputi, & 

Pagnin, 2014), have greater metacognitive knowledge (Lecce, Bianco, Demicheli, & 

Cavallini, 2014; Lecce, Zocchi, Pagnin, Palladino, & Taumoepeau, 2010), and are more 

socially competent (Imuta, Henry, Slaughter, Selcuk, & Ruffman, 2016).  To date, most of 

the progress made on understanding ToM has concerned dramatic developments in 

mindreading in the preschool years (i.e., false belief understanding).  While interest in 

infants’ and adults’ ToM has grown, the study of middle childhood is more recent (Hughes & 

Devine, 2015a).  This expansion of research on ToM into middle childhood raises important 

questions about the nature of developmental changes in ToM and associations with age-

related improvements in domain-general cognitive skills.  To address these issues, the present 

study adopted a short-term longitudinal design.  This approach has merits from both 

theoretical and practical perspectives.  Theoretically, our short-term longitudinal design 

enables us to test the role of EF in the development and expression of ToM in middle 

childhood and to examine whether results found in preschoolers can be extended to older 

children (see sections below).  At a practical level, we hoped that our findings would yield 

insights on how to promote ToM development. 

Explaining the Relations Between Theory of Mind and Executive Function

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Numerous studies have shown that individual differences in executive function (EF) 

independently predict variation in ToM in early childhood (Devine & Hughes, 2014).  EF is 

an umbrella term describing the higher-order processes for controlling, directing and 

monitoring cognitive function (Diamond, 2013; Zelazo, Carlson, & Kesek, 2008).  EF, thus, 

encompasses a rather heterogeneous collection of skills that include inhibitory control (IC), 

working memory (WM), set-shifting and planning (Miyake & Friedman, 2012).  

Correlational studies have consistently shown moderate associations between individual 

differences in EF and ToM, even when the effects of age and verbal ability are controlled 

(Carlson & Moses, 2001; Hughes, 1998).  In a meta-analysis drawing together data from 

nearly 10,000 children aged between 3 and 6 years, Devine and Hughes (2014) reported a 

moderate association between EF and false belief understanding that was similar for children 

belonging to different cultures and consistent across distinct EF tasks.  

One interpretation of these results is that the relation between EF and false belief 

understanding is peripheral and arises from the incidental demands that standard false-belief 

tasks place on EF (e.g., Perner, Lang, & Kloo, 2002).  According to this expression account, 

children need EF to display their ToM understanding.  At least four strands of evidence 

challenge the expression account.  First, meta-analysis demonstrates significant correlations 

between early EF and later ToM, even when initial ToM scores are taken into account 

(Devine & Hughes, 2014).  Second, cross-cultural research shows that cultural groups (e.g., 

Chinese children) who show higher levels of EF relative to North American or British 

children, do not exhibit a parallel advantage in ToM (Wang, Devine, Wong & Hughes, 2016).  

Third, individual differences in EF remain correlated with performance on false-belief tasks 

in which executive demands are reduced (Henning, Spinath, & Aschersleben, 2011).  Fourth, 

EF shows similarly strong associations with first- and second-order false belief tasks, even 

though the latter place greater demands on EF (Devine & Hughes, 2014).  These four strands 

 

3 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

of evidence support the view from the ‘emergence’ account (Russell, 1996) that EF 

contributes to the development of ToM and suggest that there is a deep and unique 

relationship between ToM and EF that cannot be explained by only considering the executive 

demands of ToM tasks.  

Since most of what is known about the relations between EF and ToM is based on 

data from early childhood, the next step for research is to examine these relations in middle 

childhood and beyond.  Adopting the principle of parsimony, we predicted that, as in the 

preschool years, EF would contribute to the emergence rather than expression of ToM in 

middle childhood.   

Development of Theory of Mind and Executive Function in Middle Childhood 

The dearth of research on the links between ToM and EF in middle childhood is 

surprising given that important age-related improvements across middle childhood have 

been reported for both ToM (Devine & Hughes, 2013) and EF (Davidson, Amso, Anderson, 

& Diamond, 2006; Huizinga, Dolan, & Van Der Molen, 2006).  These developmental 

changes in ToM and EF are relevant as they contribute to children’s social and cognitive 

functioning in this period of life.  Specifically, ToM understanding independently predicts 

children’s ability to: i) comprehend teachers’ comments (Lecce et al., 2011; Lecce, Caputi, et 

al., 2014); ii) establish good social relations (Slaugther et al., 2015); and iii) show better 

social competence (Devine et al., 2016) and academic achievement (Lecce et al., 2014).  

Regarding EF, Jacobson and colleagues showed that EF in late primary school uniquely 

predicted between 3% and 13.5% of the variance in children’s academic and behavioral 

functioning in Year 6 (Jacobson, Williford, & Pianta, 2011).  Moreover, regulatory skills 

independently contributed to predict variance on social functioning in 10- to 12-year-olds 

(Murphy, Shepard, Eisenberg, & Fabes, 2004). 

 

4 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

In the present study, we focused on children aged between 9 and 10 years.  The few 

available studies of ToM in middle childhood clearly show developmental changes across 

primary school (Banerjee et al., 2011; Devine & Hughes, 2013; Rice, Anderson, Velnoskey, 

Thompson, & Redcay, 2016).  For example, 11-year-old children are more skilled than 

children aged 9 in understanding faux pas (Baron-Cohen, O’Riordan, Stone, Jones, & 

Plaisted, 1999) and Im-Bolter, Agostino and Owens-Jaffray (2016) reported significant 

differences between 7- to 8-year-old children and 11- to 12-year-old children on the Strange 

Stories task.  

 

Exactly how these observed age-related differences in performance on a range of 

measures of ToM should be interpreted remains open to debate.  One possibility is that age-

related differences in performance on ToM tasks in middle childhood could be explained by 

age-related gains in verbal ability or general cognitive ability.  Several studies now show that 

age makes a unique contribution to individual differences in performance on measures of 

ToM even controlling for verbal ability (Devine & Hughes, 2013; 2016).  

A second possibility is that children undergo further meta-representational changes in 

their ability to represent another’s belief (see Apperly, 2011 and Miller, 2009).  This account 

holds that there are further breakthroughs and discoveries to be made about the nature of 

mental-state representation beyond the one required to pass false belief tasks.  According to 

Apperly (2011), this account struggles on several fronts.  It is difficult to identify what new 

insights in the ability to represent another’s belief would be required to navigate mental life 

beyond an understanding of desires, knowledge and beliefs.  In the Strange Stories task, for 

example, children are asked to apply their understanding of a character’s beliefs, knowledge 

or desires to explain a character’s actions.  Despite simply requiring an understanding of 

these mental states, there is considerable evidence for continued age-related gains in 

performance on this task across middle childhood (Devine & Hughes, 2013; 2016).  

 

5 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Moreover, similar tasks, such as the Faux Pas task, only require participants to make 

distinctions between their own and the character’s beliefs or knowledge.  Despite relying on a 

participant’s false belief understanding, there is evidence for within-person gains in 

performance on this task across middle childhood (Banerjee et al., 2011).  If the ability to 

represent another’s belief was all that mattered then one would not expect age-related gains in 

performance on either of these tasks. 

A third possibility is that children’s ability to use their understanding of mental states 

in a more flexible and appropriate way improves with age (Apperly, 2011; Bianco, Lecce, & 

Banerjee, 2016; Devine & Hughes, 2013; Hughes & Devine, 2015a).  Over middle childhood 

children develop the ability to simultaneously infer a variety of mental states in complex 

social scenarios and develop a more complex awareness of the links among multiple mental 

states (Amsterlaw, Lagattuta, & Meltzoff, 2009; Bender, Pons, Harris, & De Rosnay, 2011; 

Lagattuta, 2014).  For example, in the Faux Pas task, children are required to understand 

simultaneously the intentions, the knowledge state and the emotions of the characters.  

Interestingly, if we look at the single questions that follow each Faux Pas story it is clear that 

all typically developing primary school children should be able to make each of the above 

inferences, when considered separately, as we know that by age 5 children should be able to 

attribute ignorance to others and to understand external causes of simple positive/negative 

emotions and intentions (Pons, Harris, & De Rosnay, 2004; Wellman & Liu, 2004).  What 

seems to be challenging, therefore, is not the content of each of the mental inferences, but the 

combined focus on knowledge states, intentions, and emotions and the links between them.  

This ability to align emotions, decisions and thoughts, when referred to a single social event, 

shows a clear developmental trajectory over middle childhood (Lagattuta, Elrod, & Kramer, 

2016).  Similar conclusions can be drawn with respect to the Strange Stories and the Silent 

Film task for which a clear progression through middle childhood has been found (Devine & 

 

6 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Hughes, 2016).  In addition, these two tasks require children to apply their ToM skills not in a 

single, although complex, situation (like in the Faux Pas) but in a variety of contexts (Miller, 

2012).  This variety is challenging for children, as they are required to make mental states 

inferences that are appropriate to capture the salient aspect of the given social situation 

(Miller, 2012).  There is, therefore, a difference in ToM skills between a child who is able to 

infer a plausible (and thus appropriate) mental state in a social situation and a child who is 

able to infer the right mental state that grasps the focal point of what is happening (i.e., 

double bluff, misunderstanding and so on) (Bianco et al., 2016).  

Regarding EF, perhaps one of the most notable changes across middle childhood 

concerns the structure of EF itself.  EF has been conceptualized as a multi-faceted construct 

made up of three distinct but closely related components: WM, shifting and inhibition 

(Miyake, Friedman, Emerson, Witzki, & Howerter, 2000).  Developmental research suggests 

that these components are robustly inter-correlated in preschoolers and tend to fractionate as 

children progress through middle childhood.  Indeed, whereas a single latent factor seems 

sufficient to account for preschoolers’ performance (Hughes, Ensor, & Wilson, 2010; Wiebe, 

Espy, & Charak, 2008), this is not the case in middle childhood and adolescence (Miyake & 

Friedman, 2012; McAuley & White, 2011; van der Sluis, de Jong, & van der Leij, 2007).  

Overall, the structure of EF gradually separates with age, developing from a cohesive, general 

ability to more distinct, specific abilities (Shing, Lindenberger, Diamond, Li, & Davidson, 

2010; Xu et al., 2013).  These results provide support for the non-unitary nature of EF in 

middle childhood and adolescence and highlight the need to consider EF components 

separately when investigating older children.  Drawing on data from three time-points in 

middle childhood, the first aim of our study was to examine the development and rank-order 

stability of ToM and EF.  

Relations Between Theory of Mind and Executive Function in Middle Childhood 

 

7 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

 Recent years have seen a growing interest in the relations between ToM and EF 

beyond the preschool years.  Cross-sectional studies indicate that the relation between 

performance on ToM tasks and measures of EF is weak to moderate in adolescence (Vetter, 

Altgassen, Phillips, Mahy, & Kliegel, 2013) and middle childhood (Bock, Gallaway, & 

Hund, 2015; Cantin, Gnaedinger, Gallaway, Hesson-McInnis, & Hund, 2016; Lagattuta, 

Sayfan, & Harvey, 2014; Wang et al., 2016).  However, relatively few studies (e.g., Carlson, 

Moses, & Breton, 2002) have examined the specific links between distinct aspects of EF and 

children’s ToM.  While the meta-analytic evidence based on preschool children suggests that 

there is a consistent link between distinct measures of EF and false-belief task performance 

(Devine & Hughes, 2014), it is entirely possible that the relations between ToM and specific 

aspects of EF may shift as EF becomes more fractionated.  Addressing this possibility, our 

second aim was to examine the links between individual differences in ToM and in two key 

components of EF: WM and IC.  We chose to focus on WM and IC as they appear to have 

the strongest association with ToM during early childhood (Devine & Hughes, 2014; 

Marcovitch et al., 2015).  We did not include a measure of cognitive flexibility to minimize 

the burden on participants and because existing studies indicates that cognitive flexibility 

plays a relatively minor role in more mature ToM (Ahmed & Miller, 2011, Wang et al., 

2016). 

With few exceptions (Austin, Groppe, & Elsner, 2014; Devine et al., 2016), the great 

majority of existing studies on EF in middle childhood are cross-sectional.  Unlike cross-

sectional studies, longitudinal designs, and more specifically cross-lagged longitudinal 

designs, provide a platform for testing developmental theories about the relations between 

different constructs.  While cross-sectional studies can reveal whether or not two variables 

are related at a specific point in time, cross-lagged longitudinal designs are needed to 

determine whether one variable is implicated in the development of another variable 

 

8 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

(Newsom, 2015).  Cross-sectional findings from middle childhood provide some evidence for 

an ongoing relation between ToM and EF beyond the preschool years, but do not enable any 

further analysis of the developmental relations between these constructs.  Cross-lagged 

longitudinal research provides one way to begin to unpack the association between ToM and 

EF beyond the preschool years.  

In the first study of its kind, Austin et al. (2014) examined the relations between a 

composite measure of ToM and three EF domains: attention shifting (Cognitive Attention 

shifting task, Röthlisberger, Neuenschwander, Michel, & Roebers, 2010), WM (Digit-Span 

Backward task, Petermann and Petermann, 2007) and IC (Fruit Stroop task, Archibald & 

Kerns, 1999).  ToM was measured by summing children’s scores on two second-order false-

belief tasks (Perner & Wimmer, 1985), the Strange Stories (Happé, 1994), the Extended 

Theory-of-Mind Scale (Henning, Hofer, & Aschersleben, 2012) and a cartoon sequencing 

ToM task (Völlm et al., 2006).  This study, involving 1657 children aged between 6 and 11 

years followed across a 12-month period, showed weak concurrent associations between each 

measure of EF and ToM task performance and very weak (but statistically significant) cross-

lagged associations between each indicator of EF and ToM performance (all βs < .10).  

Despite these very weak effects, the authors concluded that there was a reciprocal relation 

between EF and ToM.  However, at both time points the sample varied widely in age (i.e., a 

range of 5 years), which coupled with the lack of a control measure of verbal ability makes 

these findings even more difficult to interpret.  

In another longitudinal study Devine et al. (2016) examined the links between 

composite measures of ToM and EF at two time points spanning a 4-year period in middle 

childhood.  ToM was measured via classical first- and second-order false-belief tasks at 

Wave 1 and via the Strange Stories (White, Hill, Happé, & Frith, 2009), the Silent Film 

(Devine & Hughes, 2013) and the Triangles (Castelli, Happé, Frith, & Frith, 2000) tasks at 

 

9 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Wave 2.  EF was assessed using a conflict-inhibition task (Gerstadt, Hong, & Diamond, 

1994) together with a shifting task (Trucks Game, Hughes & Ensor, 2005), a planning task 

(Tower of London, Shallice, 1982), and a WM task (Bead memory task, Thorndike, Hagen, 

& Sattler, 1986) at Wave 1.  At Wave 2 EF was assessed using conflict inhibition task 

(Arrows task, Davidson et al., 2006), a shifting task (Smiling Face task, Huizinga et al., 2006) 

and WM task (Thorndike et al., 1986).  Concurrent correlations between ToM and EF were of 

moderate strength at age 6 but weak at age 10.  Cross-lagged longitudinal analyses revealed 

that developmental relations between these two constructs were non-significant (βs < .15).  

Devine et al. (2016) proposed that the relations between ToM and EF may change in nature 

beyond the preschool years.  These results may indicate that EF predicts ToM development in 

preschool but not in middle childhood.  However, two methodological features of this study, 

namely the extended interval between time points and use of different measures at each wave 

of the study, suggest an alternative interpretation.  The authors acknowledged that as well as 

attenuating any correlations between the two constructs over time, the extended temporal 

span and the use of different measures might have masked any proximal developmental 

influence of EF on ToM.  By adopting a short-term longitudinal design in which the same 

tasks were used at each time-point, we hoped to identify whether Devine et al.’s (2016) 

findings reflect a genuine developmental shift in links between EF and ToM or whether this 

contrast is a spurious artefact of methodological factors.   

In sum, data from the only two longitudinal studies of the links between EF and ToM 

in middle childhood have produced equivocal results.  Our third aim was therefore to conduct 

cross-lagged analyses of the associations between two aspects of executive function (i.e., IC 

and WM) and performance on a battery of reliable, valid ToM tasks that has previously 

proved sensitive to individual differences (Devine & Hughes, 2016).  In contrast with 

previous studies, we focused on children within a relatively narrow age-range, monitored 

 

10 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

performance at 6-month intervals and used the same measures of EF and ToM at each time 

point.  

Summary of Aims 

The current study had three distinct aims.  The first aim was to examine, for the first 

time, the development and longitudinal rank-order stability of ToM, WM and IC across three 

time points over a 12-month period in middle childhood.  The second aim was to examine the 

concurrent relations between ToM, IC and WM in middle childhood.  The third and final aim 

of our study was to assess the developmental relations between EF and ToM.  We designed a 

three-wave cross-lagged longitudinal study in which we measured individual differences in 

children’s ToM and EF across three time points from age 9.5 to 10.5 years.  This design 

enabled us to examine the direction of the relations between EF and ToM, after controlling 

for rank-order stability and language ability.   

Method 

Participants 

 

The participants (N = 113; 61 boys) were recruited from 5 public schools (9 classes) 

in Northern Italy.  The children were 9.36 years old (M = 112.3 months, SD = 4.18 months) at 

Time 1, 9.85 years old (M = 118.3 months, SD = 4.15 months) at Time 2, and 10.39 years old 

(M = 124.7 months, SD = 4.06 months) at Time 3.  The measurement intervals from Time 1 

to Time 2, M = 6 months, SD = 0.72 months, and from Time 2 to Time 3, M = 6.26, SD = 

0.74, differed significantly, MDiff = 0.25 months, SE = 0.12, t (112) = 2.08, p = .04, d = 0.20. 

All the children were fluent Italian speakers and none had a history of developmental delay or 

learning disorder.  With regard to family structure: 21 subjects were singletons, 63 had one 

sibling, 22 had two siblings, 5 had three siblings, and 2 had more than 3 siblings. 

Measures 

 

11 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Socio-economic status.  We used the Family Affluence Scale (FAS, Currie et al., 

2008) to assess material wealth.  The FAS is a child-report questionnaire consisting of four 

questions evaluating family car ownership (range 0-2), having an unshared bedroom (range 

0-1), the number of computers at home (range 0-3), and the number of family vacations in a 

12 month period (range 0-3).  Responses were summed into an overall index of family socio-

economic background.  Possible total scores could range from 0 to 9 points.  

Verbal ability.  We administered the Italian version of the vocabulary subtest of the 

Primary Mental Abilities test at each time point in this study (PMA; Thurstone & Thurstone, 

1962; Rubini & Rossi, 1982).  This test requires children to select the right synonym of a 

target word out of 4 alternatives.  There were 30 target words and a time limit of 7 min was 

set.  Possible total scores could range from 0 to 30 points.  

WM.  We used the Backwards Digit Span task (Orsini, 1997).  This tasks required 

children to listen to 7 sequences of 2 to 8 digits and recall them in reverse order.  Each 

sequence was marked as a pass (1) or fail (0), and total scores could range from 0 to 7 points. 

IC.  We administered the Arrows task (Davidson et al., 2006).  For each trial, a single 

arrow was presented on either the left or the right of a computer screen.  On congruent trials, 

the arrow pointed straight down (towards the response button on the same side as the arrow); 

on incongruent trials, the arrow pointed diagonally towards the opposite side at a 45° angle 

(toward the response button on the side opposite to the arrow).  The incongruent condition 

required inhibiting the tendency to respond on the same side where the stimulus occurred.  

Stimulus presentation time was 750ms and the inter-stimulus interval was 500ms.  Congruent 

and Incongruent trials were presented in 6 blocks of 4 stimuli each (congruent right, 

congruent left, incongruent right and incongruent left).  Each block presented the stimuli in 

randomized order with no breaks between the blocks.  We computed an accuracy score for 

 

12 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

the incongruent trials (Devine et al., 2016) by summing the total number of correct responses.  

Anticipatory responses (< 200ms) and missed responses were scored as errors.  

ToM.  We administered the Strange Stories Test (Happé, 1994; White et al., 2009) 

and the Silent Films task (Devine & Hughes, 2013).  These two tasks have been used in 

large-scale studies of individual differences in children’s ToM across middle childhood 

(Devine & Hughes, 2013; 2016).  They show excellent one-month test-retest reliability in 

middle childhood, high levels of internal consistency (Devine & Hughes, 2016) and 

convergent validity (Devine & Hughes, 2016).  Moreover, performance on both tasks shows 

construct validity in that individual differences in performance on both tasks at age 10 are 

significantly associated with individual differences in children’s false belief understanding at 

age 6 (Devine et al., 2016), children’s self-rated social exclusion (Devine & Hughes, 2013) 

and teachers’ ratings of children’s social competence (Devine et al., 2016). 

The Strange Stories requires children to interpret non-literal statements by making 

inferences about mental states (see Appendix A).  We administered five stories: 2 double 

bluff, 1 persuasion, 1 misunderstanding, 1 white lie.  They were presented in a written form, 

the experimenter read each of them and asked children to write down their answers (while 

having the stories in front of them) and no time limit was set.  In line with the scoring 

procedures (White et al., 2009), we rated children's responses using a three-point scale: 0 for 

an incorrect or did not know answer, 1 for partial or implicit correct answers and 2 for full 

and explicit correct answers.  Total scores could range from 0 to 10 points.  A second rater 

independently coded 25% of the responses at each time point and inter-rater agreement was 

established using Cohen’s kappa (at Time 1, κ = .93; at Time 2, κ = .95; at Time 3, κ = .77).  

The Silent Film task measures individual differences in participants’ use of their 

understanding of desires, knowledge and beliefs to explain social situations (see Appendix 

B).  The Silent Film task consists of 5 short film clips from a classic silent comedy, Harold 

 

13 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Lloyd’s ‘Safety Last’ (Roach, Newmeyer, & Taylor, 1923).  The children were instructed to 

watch each short film clip once and to answer a question about a character’s behavior.  Oral 

answers were transcribed and scored using a three-point scale according to the standard 

scoring guidelines: 0 for an incorrect response, 1 for a partially correct response and 2 for an 

explicit mentalistic explanation of the character’s behavior.  There were 5 film clips and 6 

questions.  Total scores could range from 0 to 12 points.  A second rater independently coded 

25% of the responses at each time point and inter-rater agreement was established using 

Cohen’s kappa (at Time 1, κ = .91; at Time 2, κ = .92; at Time 3, κ = .85).  

Procedure 

 

Children’s ToM, EF, and verbal ability were measured at three time points: at the 

beginning of Year 4 (Time 1), at the end of Year 4 (Time 2) and, finally at the beginning of 

Year 5 (Time 3)1.  Whole class sessions were used to administer the test of verbal ability and 

the strange stories.  Children were cautioned not to discuss the items and to work 

independently; no feedbacks were provided.  All the other tasks were administered 

individually in a quiet room located in the school.  We also gathered information about 

children’s socio-economic background and number of siblings.  Parental written informed 

consent was obtained.  The order of tasks was counterbalanced.  

Results 

Data Reduction and Descriptive Statistics  

We used structural equation modelling in MPlus Version 7 (Muthèn & Muthèn, 2012) 

to examine the longitudinal associations between measures of EF and individual differences 

in ToM.  Table 1 and Table 2 show the descriptive statistics and correlations between 

measures of ToM and EF across the three time points of the study.

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

On the basis of preliminary correlational and confirmatory factor analysis (see 

Appendix C), our primary analyses were conducted using an aggregate ToM measure.  The 

measures of IC and WM were not correlated at Time 1 or Time 3 and only weakly correlated 

at Time 2.  We therefore examined the relations between ToM and these two variables 

separately. 

Development of Theory of Mind and Executive Function Across Middle Childhood 

 First, we examined change in performance on each of the key study variables.  

Performance on the Strange Stories, F (2,224) = 93.81, p < .001, partial η2 = .46, and the 

Silent Film task, F (2,224) = 29.33, p < .001, partial η2 = .21, improved significantly across 

the three waves of the study.  On the Strange Stories there were significant gains from Time 1 

to Time 2, t (112) = 10.16, p < .001, d = 0.96, from Time 2 to Time 3, t (112) = 2.57, p < .05, 

d = 0.24, and from Time 1 to Time 3, t (112) = 10.16, p < .001, d = 0.96.  There were also 

significant gains from Time 1 to Time 2, t (112) = 4.79, p < .001, d = 0.89, and from Time 2 

to Time 3, t (112) = 3.18, p < .01, d = 0.30, and from Time 1 to Time 3, t(112) = 6.90, p < 

.001, d = 0.65, on the Silent Film task.  Inspection of the item-level data (Table S12) revealed 

that performance on all items improved significantly from Time 1 to Time 3 suggesting that 

mean changes in performance were not driven by any one item in particular.  Unsurprisingly, 

scores on the aggregate ToM variable scores also improved significantly across the three 

waves of the study, F (2, 224) = 101.72, p < .001, partial η2 = .48.  There were significant 

gains in performance from Time 1 to Time 2, t (112) = 9.66, p < .001, d = 0.91, from Time 1 

to Time 3, t (112) = 13.56, p < .001, d = 1.27, and from Time 2 to Time 3, t (112) = 4.02, p < 

.001, d = 0.38.  Mauchly’s test revealed that the assumption of sphericity had been violated 

for the effects of time on IC task and so we corrected the degrees of freedom using the 

Greenhouse-Geisser correction.  There was a significant main effect of time on performance

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

across the three waves of the study, F (1.85, 206.72) = 46.76, p < .001, partial η2 = .30.  Post-

hoc tests revealed that accuracy on the IC task was significantly greater at Time 3 than at 

Time 2, t (112) = 8.04, p < .001, d = 0.76, and Time 1, t (112) = 7.80, p < .001, d = 0.73.  

There were no differences in performance between Time 1 and Time 2, t (112) = 0.97, p = 

.33, d = 0.09. There was no evidence of time-related change in performance on the WM task, 

F (2, 224) = 0.66, p = .52, partial η2 = .01. 

Concurrent Relations Between Theory of Mind and Executive Function 

Table 2 shows the correlations and partial correlations (controlling for verbal ability 

and age) between each of the key study measures and background variables.  Visual 

inspection of the correlation matrix showed that there were no differences in the pattern of 

concurrent associations between each individual measure of ToM and IC or WM.  Thus, here 

we describe the correlations between the aggregate measure of ToM and measures of EF 

within each time point.  

Within each time point, individual differences in performance on the aggregate 

measure of ToM were significantly correlated with concurrent measures of verbal ability, 

rTime 1 (111) = .32, p < .01, rTime 2 (111) = .43, p < .01, and rTime 3 (111) = .40, p < .01.  There 

were no significant correlations between ToM and gender, -.11 ≤ r (111) ≤ .12, family 

affluence, .01 ≤ r (111) ≤ .11, or number of siblings, -.01 ≤ r (111) ≤ .10.  Even when the 

effects of earlier verbal ability and later age were taken into account, there was moderate 

rank-order stability in performance on the aggregate measure of ToM from Time 1 to Time 2, 

r (109) = .45, p < .01, from Time 1 to Time 3, r (109) = .44, p < .01, and from Time 2 to 

Time 3, r (109) = .46, p < .01.  

At Time 1 and Time 2 there were no significant concurrent associations between 

individual differences in performance on the aggregate measure of ToM and either WM, rTime 

1 (111) = .08, rTime 2 (111) = .17, or IC, rTime 1 (111) = .10, rTime 2 (111) = .04.  In contrast, 

 

18 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

there were weak associations between individual differences in ToM and both WM, r (111) = 

.28, p < .01, and IC, r (111) = .19, p < .05, at Time 3.  The Time 3 correlation between WM 

and ToM remained significant even when the effects of concurrent verbal ability and age 

were taken into account, pr (109) = .20, p < .05.  The Time 3 correlation between IC and 

ToM was weak and non-significant, pr (109) = .16, p < .10.  

Longitudinal Relations Between Theory of Mind and Executive Function 

We used four primary criteria to assess the acceptability of our structural models: a 

non-significant χ2 test of model fit, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) > 0.95, Tucker Lewis Index 

(TLI) > 0.95 and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) < 0.08 (Brown, 

2015).  In each of our longitudinal models we estimated the stability of each construct over 

time by regressing Time 3 measures onto Time 2 measures and Time 2 measures onto Time 1 

measures.  We regressed the Time 3 and Time 2 measures onto individual differences in prior 

verbal ability and gender to control for these variables.  We also regressed the Time 2 values 

onto the Time 1 to Time 2 interval (in months) and the Time 3 values onto the Time 2 to 

Time 3 interval to control for individual differences in the length of time between each 

testing period.  Crucially, we estimated cross-lagged paths to assess the direction of the 

developmental relations between our measures of executive function and ToM.  Finally, we 

permitted each of the predictor variables (and the outcome variables) in our three-wave 

model to co-vary.  Given the non-normal distribution of some of the variables in our dataset, 

we used robust maximum likelihood (MLM) estimation with a mean-adjusted χ2 test statistic 

for each of our models (Kline, 2011).  

Our cross-lagged longitudinal model provided an acceptable fit to the data, χ2 (31) = 

29.50, p = 0.54, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 1.01, RMSEA = 0, 90% CI [0, 0.07].  A simplified 

depiction of this model (showing only significant pathways) is shown in Figure 1. For the 

 

19 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

purposes of interpretation, the non-significant paths emanating to and from ToM have been 

included as dashed lines.

to and from theory of mind have been depicted (these are represented as dashed lines). All 
model parameters (including the covariates) are presented in Table S2.  

 

The complete results for this model are presented in Table S23.  At Time 2 the model 

accounted for 40% of the variance in ToM, 22% of the variance in IC and 30% of the

variance in WM.  At Time 3 the model explained 43% of the variance in ToM, 28% of the 

variance in IC and 23% of the variance in WM.  

Four features of this model deserve note.  First, all four variables measured (i.e., ToM, 

WM, IC and verbal ability) exhibited moderate rank-order stability over time.  Second, there 

were significant cross-lagged associations between Time 1 WM and Time 2 ToM and 

between Time 2 WM and Time 3 ToM (depicted in blue in Figure 1).  In contrast there were 

no significant cross-lagged relations between earlier ToM and later WM (depicted as green 

dashed lines in Figure 1).  Third, with the exception of the path between Time 1 IC and Time 

2 ToM (depicted in red in Figure 1), there were no other cross-lagged associations between 

IC and ToM (depicted as red dashed lines in Figure 1).  Fourth, with the exception of the path 

between Time 1 WM and Time 2 IC, there were no significant cross-lagged relations between 

WM and IC.  We used model comparisons to investigate these results further (see Appendix 

D). 

Discussion 

The main aims of the present 12-month longitudinal study were to examine the 

development of ToM and EF in middle childhood and assess both concurrent and across-time 

relations between individual differences in ToM and EF.  Our study yielded three key sets of 

results.  First, performance on each measure of ToM (and the aggregate theory-of-mind 

score) was stable and improved over the course of the study.  Supplementary analyses 

showed that these changes are unlikely to be due to any one item in either test of ToM.  With 

regard to the measures of EF, children’s IC performance, but not their WM, improved across 

the course of the study.  Second, correlation analyses showed that there were no concurrent 

associations between measures of ToM, IC or WM at Time 1 and Time 2 and weak 

associations between these variables at Time 3.  Third, our longitudinal structural equation 

models (controlling for verbal ability, gender and individual differences in the interval 

 

21 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

duration) demonstrated that there were unique longitudinal associations between WM and 

later ToM and that between Time 2 and Time 3 this association was unidirectional.  In 

contrast, there was only a weak negative association between Time 1 IC and Time 2 ToM but 

not vice versa.  

Theory of Mind in Middle Childhood 

The present study follows a growing interest in ToM (Hughes, 2016).  Our 

longitudinal study contributes to the emerging literature on ToM in middle childhood in at 

least three ways.  First, our study revealed a steady increase in children’s performance on the 

Strange Stories (White et al., 2009) and Silent Films (Devine & Hughes, 2013) tasks in late 

middle childhood.  This result supports the hypothesis that ToM development in middle 

childhood is characterized not by any stage-like conceptual change, but rather by a gradual 

improvement in children’s ability to apply their ToM skills to a variety of complex social 

situations (Apperly, 2011).  

Second, in line with existing findings (Banerjee et al., 2011; Lecce et al., 2010; 

Devine et al., 2016) our results provide further evidence of strong stability of individual 

differences in ToM in middle childhood.  This stability is important for more than one reason.  

Methodologically, it reassures us of the reliability of our chosen measures.  Theoretically, it 

demonstrates that individual differences are not temporary fluctuations in task performance 

but, rather, genuine characteristics of the children (see Hughes & Devine, 2015b).  These 

results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting that individual differences in ToM are 

meaningful for children’s social (Banerjee et al., 2011; Devine & Hughes, 2013; Devine et 

al., 2016) and cognitive development (Lecce, Caputi, et al., 2014) in primary school years.  

Here it is worth noting that ToM is an ability embedded in real-life school activities.  It 

underpins children’s awareness of what is happening and potentially influences children’s 

behavior during social exchanges and cognitive activities in classes and play time.  

 

22 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

Executive Function in Middle Childhood 

Results on EF showed, between the ages 10 (Time 2) and 10.5 years (Time 3), a 

substantial increase in children’s IC but not in their WM.  No change in IC between Time 1 

and Time 2 was found.  The results for IC add to a growing body of literature (Brocki & 

Bohlin, 2004; Cragg & Nation, 2008; Huizinga et al., 2006; Jonkman, 2006; Lamm, Zelazo, 

& Lewis, 2006).  The absence of age-related differences in WM does not mean that no 

changes in WM occur during middle childhood as shown by the literature (Brocki & Bohlin; 

2004; Prencipe et al., 2011).  It may indicate that the development of WM is discontinuous 

and the age range we considered in the present study (9.5 -10.5 years) is not very revealing 

for developmental shifts.  We found no evidence for an association between WM and IC.  

This may reflect the specific characteristics of the measures that we selected.  Davidson et al. 

(2006) designed the Arrows IC task to have relatively few WM demands.  Indeed, the Arrows 

Task requires inhibiting the tendency to respond on the same side as the stimulus when a 

diagonal arrow appears, but it requires little or no WM, as the arrow points directly to the 

correct response button on all trials.  The lack of association between IC and WM may also 

reflect the increased diversity in the structure of EF associated with growing age as reported 

by Shing and colleagues (2010) and Huizinga et al. (2006) in children aged 4 to 14,5 and 7 to 

21 years respectively. 

Relations Between ToM and EF in Middle Childhood 

 

Whereas in preschoolers a moderate cross-sectional correlation between EF and ToM 

and a developmental association between early EF and later ToM task performance (Devine 

& Hughes, 2014) were found, studies on middle childhood have provided equivocal results 

(Austin et al., 2014; Devine et al., 2016).  To address the methodological factors that may 

have contributed to these equivocal findings, the present study used the same ToM and EF 

tasks at each time point and examined longitudinal associations between ToM and EF across 

 

23 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

short temporal periods (6-months) in a narrowly age defined group of children.  Consistent 

with data from the preschool literature (Devine & Hughes, 2014), we found a uni-directional 

developmental relation between ToM and one aspect of EF, WM: early individual differences 

in WM predicted later individual differences in ToM.  However, there were overall no 

developmental relations between ToM and IC across the three time points covered in our 

sample.  In other words WM, but not IC, appears to contribute to the on-going development 

of ToM in late middle childhood.  

Interestingly, in our study WM was related to later, but not concurrent, ToM.  This 

finding corroborates results of a number of studies involving school-aged children and using 

the same measures as in the present study: Strange Stories (Bock, Gallaway, & Hund, 2015; 

Osterhaus, Koerber, & Sodian, 2016; Oswald, 2013) and Silent films (Wang et al., 2016).  

Together these null findings contrast with studies of pre-schoolers that indicate moderate 

correlations between measures of WM and false belief understanding (e.g., Devine & 

Hughes, 2014).  This contrast is open to at least two explanations.  

First, traditional false-belief tasks differ from these ‘advanced’ measures of ToM in 

obvious ways.  Specifically, the classic change-of-location false belief task requires children 

to keep track of multiple story elements.  In contrast, in the Strange Stories task the text 

remains available to the child and so minimizes WM demands.  Likewise, the Silent Film 

task has minimal WM demands because the clips are very brief (approximately 30s long) and 

are non-verbal.  Each of the scenarios in this task contains a comparable number of story 

elements to the classic change-of-location false belief task.  From a developmental 

perspective, while this number of story elements could conceivably place demands on WM in 

a pre-schooler, it is unlikely to challenge the WM capacity of school-aged child. 

Second, an imaging study conducted by Blakemore and colleagues (Blakemore, den 

Ouden, Choudhury, & Frith, 2007) has shown that when tested using a vignette-based 

 

24 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

measure of belief reasoning, adolescents and adults show comparable behavioural 

performance but this performance is underpinned by different neural mechanisms.  

Specifically, relative to adults, adolescents exhibited significantly greater activation of the 

medial prefrontal cortex and lower levels of activation in the right superior temporal sulcus.  

While preliminary, these findings underscore the need for greater attention to developmental 

processes when studying the relations between ToM and EF.  Results of the present study 

also fit with those of a recent training study on children of the same age range (Lecce & 

Bianco, 2017).  In this study children with a better WM at pre-test were more able to 

capitalize on a ToM conversational-based training than children with low WM.  Despite we 

cannot be sure that learning ToM through training leverages the same cognitive processes 

that promote ToM in daily life, it is important to note that the training activities used in Lecce 

and Bianco training (i.e., conversations on narratives) were selected to be very similar to 

those children encounter at school during daily lectures.  

The longitudinal relationship between WM at Time 1 and Time 2 with ToM at Time 2 

and Time 3 (respectively) is in line with the emergence account.  Whereas this account is 

tolerant to a concurrent dissociation between EF and ToM, it posits longitudinal relations 

between early EF and later ToM because EF is needed for ToM to develop.  Although the 

present study did not allowed us to address the issue of why this longitudinal association 

emerged, we speculate the WM might facilitate children in the process of learning about 

other minds from relevant social experience.  Specifically, WM is likely to promote the 

ability to notice discrepancies between previously established expectations/knowledge and 

subsequent inputs and, thus, to flexibly update prior knowledge and mental models (Benson 

& Sabbagh, 2013).  This, in turn, is likely to promote the development of ToM over time. 

Crucially, the role of WM seems particularly important in middle childhood as social 

 

25 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

situations are complex in this developmental period and children need to hold in mind and 

keep track of multiple and often discordant perspectives (Oswald, 2013).  

Our findings go some way towards clarifying the findings reported by Devine et al. 

(2016).  Their study spanned over 4 years in middle childhood and revealed no 

developmental links between early EF (measured at age 6) and later ToM (measured at age 

10).  Devine et al. (2016) suggested that the nature of the relations between EF and ToM 

shifts with development.  That is, EF may contribute to the emergence of ToM in preschool 

but to the expression of ToM in middle childhood.  While our findings do not directly support 

this hypothesis, they do suggest a developmental shift in the nature of the relations between 

ToM and EF.  In particular, whereas there appears to be a general link between a range of 

different measures of EF in the preschool years (Devine & Hughes, 2014), our results suggest 

that in late middle childhood the links with ToM might be specific to WM.  

Our findings show that the role of IC in ToM development in middle childhood is 

minor.  We indeed, found only one significant link out of 6; this was a significant negative 

effect of T1 IC on T2 ToM.  Even if we are aware that this data requires further replication, 

the unexpected direction of this association deserves some attention.  A large amount of 

studies conducted on preschoolers indeed found a positive (instead of negative) longitudinal 

association between early IC and later ToM (Devine & Hughes, 2014).  This relationship was 

due to the fact that in order to pass first-order FB scenarios, the child is required to inhibit a 

predominant response to answer based on her own accurate perspective of reality.  It is 

possible that this mechanism does not work for more advanced ToM understanding such as 

the one considered in the present study.  Indeed, children’s knowledge may be helpful in 

order to respond to some Strange Stories and Silent Films.  It is possible that children rely, at 

least in part, on their previous social knowledge in order to perform these tasks.  For 

example, to understand a white lie or a persuasion scenario children’s previous experience 

 

26

may have created a structured representation that helps them in decoding social information. 

Following this line of interpretation, higher IC may hinder, rather than promote, the 

understanding of complex social scenarios involving mental states. 

Caveats and Conclusions 

Overall our study showed that although WM, IC and ToM are not concurrently 

correlated in middle childhood, individual differences in WM contribute to the development, 

at least in the short term of ToM.  Our study has a number of limitations that should be 

acknowledged and that correspond with directions for further research.  First, we used only 

one task to index IC and WM; aggregate measures of IC and WM would provide more 

reliable estimates of EF in future research.  Second larger samples are needed to confirm our 

results and study how change in one variable drives change in the other.  That said, our study 

is the first to examine the development and relations between EF and ToM in middle 

childhood using a short-term multi-wave longitudinal design and has several strengths.  First, 

the independence of our measures of WM and IC meant that we were able to assess their 

unique contributions to individual differences in ToM in middle childhood and reveal specific 

pattern of associations across time.  Second, the short-term longitudinal design of the study 

and the relatively narrow age range of the participants minimized the effect of potential 

confounding factors, enabling us to draw a specific picture of the relations between ToM and 

EF in middle childhood.  We were able to show that WM plays a significant role in 

supporting the child to reach a more mature understanding of mental phenomena in a 6 

months span, but more research is needed to unfold the specific mechanisms explaining this 

effect.  Indeed, our design did not permit us to study whether this developmental relation is 

specific to ToM development.  Similarly, future studies should manipulate the executive 

demands of the focal task to check if different EF levels have an impact on the EF-ToM 

 

27 

Running Head: THEORY OF MIND AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN MIDDLE CHILDHOOD 

developmental relation.  This manipulation would also clarify if, during middle childhood, 

EF has also a role in ToM expression.  

Future research should also address the issue of the social mechanisms underlying the 

associations between WM and ToM (Benson & Sabbagh, 2013).  One interesting possibility 

is that WM might enable children to learn from the types of everyday experiences that 

provide them with information about other people’s minds (Benson & Sabbagh, 2013).  More 

specifically, Benson and Sabbagh (2009) suggest that WM may have a double role in 

enabling children to: (i) elicit and maintain social interactions from which they pick up new 

insights on mental states; and (ii) make use of ToM-relevant information.  

Our study extends existing work on the relations between ToM and EF in middle 

childhood and has both practical and theoretical implications.  In view of the fact that EF has 

a significant, but rather weak effect on later ToM, our study may provide an impetus for 

investigating the role of social factors, such as peer relationships (Banerjee et al., 2011) and 

conversations (Lecce, Bianco, et al., 2014), in ToM development in middle childhood.  

Indeed, social environmental factors in general (e.g., friends and peers) account for 66% 

(Ronald, Viding, Happé, & Plomin, 2006), and, more precisely, conversations about the mind 

for about 23%, of variance in ToM performance during middle childhood (Lecce et al., 

2014).  More integrative work that examine the relative salience and interplay between the 

predictors of both EF and ToM would be a fruitful avenue for future research in this area.

Example Item and Scoring Criteria from the Strange Stories Task (White et al., 2009) 

 

Jill wanted to buy a kitten, so she went to see Mrs. Smith, who had lots of kittens she 

didn’t want. Now Mrs. Smith loved the kittens, and she wouldn’t do anything to harm them, 

though she couldn’t keep them all herself. When Jill visited she wasn’t sure she wanted one 

of Mrs. Smith’s kittens, since they were all males and she had wanted a female. But Mrs. 

Smith said, ‘‘If no one buys the kittens I’ll just have to drown them!’’ 

QUESTION: Why did Mrs. Smith say that? 

2 points—reference to persuasion, manipulating feelings, trying to induce guilt ⁄ pity 

1 point—reference to outcome (to sell them or get rid of them in a way which implies 

not drowning) or simple motivation (to make Jill sad) 

0 points—reference to general knowledge without realization that the statement was 

not true (she’s a horrible woman)

2 points—The driver didn’t know Harold was in the van; He didn’t mean/intend to. 

1 point—He wanted/had to continue on his rounds (factual); He did not see/hear him 

(no explicit reference to a mental state). 

 

0 point—The man is deaf/hard of hearing (no mention of ‘knowing’); He was reading 

on the van; He wasn’t supposed to be there; The man told him to; He kidnapped him.

Preliminary Analysis 

 

Correlations between Strange Stories and Silent Film tasks were significant within 

each time point of the study, .24 < r < .30, all ps < .01.  These correlations were weaker than 

those reported in previous studies using error-free latent variable correlations (Devine & 

Hughes, 2013; 2016) but consistent with those reporting the correlations between raw 

summed scores (Devine et al., 2016).  A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), using a robust 

maximum likelihood estimator, in which each of the two theory-of-mind tasks were permitted 

to load onto a single latent variable at each time point provided an acceptable fit to the data, 

χ2 (1) = 0.24, p = 0.63, CFI = 1.00, TLI = 1.09, RMSEA = 0.  At each time-point both theory-

of-mind tasks loaded significantly onto the respective latent factor, all standardized loadings 

>.34, all ps <.001.  Moreover, the factor determinacy co-effecients were .83 at Time 1, .85 at 

Time 2, and .88 at Time 3, indicating high internal consistency (Brown, 2015).

Comparison of Nested Models 

 

We examined whether placing equality constraints on specific model parameters 

would result in changes of fit relative to our baseline (comparison) model (reported above).  

Since we used a robust maximum likelihood estimator with a mean-adjusted χ2 test statistic, 

we calculated the χ2 difference between each nested model and the comparison model using 

the Sartorra-Bentler χ2 difference test (Sartorra & Bentler, 2010).  Model fit statistics for each 

of these nested models are presented in Table 3.

First, to examine the asymmetry in the longitudinal association between WM and 

ToM, we constrained the cross-lagged paths from Time 1 to Time 2 (Nested Model 1) and 

from Time 2 to Time 3 (Nested Model 2) to equality.  Nested Model 1 did not produce a 

statistically significant decrease in model fit relative to the baseline model indicating that 

there was no significant difference in the strength of these two paths, Δχ2(1) = 3.39, p = .07.  

This means that the path from ToM at Time 1 to WM at Time 2 did not differ in strength 

from the path from WM at Time 1 to ToM at Time 2.  In contrast, there was a significant 

decrease in model fit between Nested Model 2 and the baseline model, Δχ2(1) = 8.14, p = 

.004, indicating that there was a significant difference between two regression paths.  That is, 

there was a unidirectional longitudinal association between Time 2 WM and Time 3 ToM but 

not vice versa.  

Second, to examine the cross-lagged longitudinal associations between IC and later 

ToM, we estimated two further nested models in which we constrained the cross-lagged paths 

from Time 1 to Time 2 (Nested Model 3) and from Time 2 to Time 3 (Nested Model 4) to 

equality.  Nested Model 3 produced a significant decrease in model fit relative to the baseline 

model, Δχ2(1) = 6.06, p = .013, indicating that the path from Time 1 IC to Time 2 ToM 

differed in strength from the path from Time 1 ToM to Time 2 IC.  Specifically, there was a 

unidirectional negative association between Time 1 IC and Time 2 ToM but not vice versa.  

Nested Model 4 produced a slight but statistically non-significant decrease in model fit 

relative to baseline, Δχ2(1) = 3.81, p = .06, indicating that there was no significant difference 

in the strength of the regression paths linking Time 2 IC with Time 3 ToM and linking Time 

2 ToM with Time 3 IC.  This means that there were no significant longitudinal associations 

between either construct from Time 2 to Time 3 and that the strength of these cross-lagged 

paths did not differ from one another.

Third, to compare the strength of the longitudinal associations between WM and ToM 

and between IC and ToM, we constrained the cross-lagged paths from Time 1 WM to Time 2 

ToM and Time 1 IC to Time 2 ToM to equality (Nested Model 5).  We then constrained the 

paths fromTime 2 WM to Time 3 ToM and from Time 2 IC to Time 3 ToM to equality 

(Nested Model 6).  Nested Model 5 resulted in a significant decrease in model fit relative to 

the baseline model, Δχ2(1) = 6.74, p = .009, indicating that there was a significant difference 

in the strength of the longitudinal associations between Time 1 WM and Time 2 ToM and 

between Time 1 IC and Time 2 ToM.  These paths differed significantly in strength from one 

another with Time 1 WM showing a positive association with Time 2 ToM and Time 1 IC 

showing a negative association with Time 2 ToM.  There was also a significant decrease in 

model fit between Nested Model 6 and the baseline model, Δχ2(1) = 6.75, p = .009, indicating 

that there was a significant difference in the strength of the association between Time 2 WM 

and Time 3 ToM and between Time 2 IC and Time 3 ToM.  That is, while Time 2 WM was a 

significant predictor of Time 3 ToM, IC at Time 2 did not predict Time 3 ToM.
