At 18 months, children engage in a variety of social
behaviors that reﬂect their nascent ability to under-
stand the intentions of other people (e.g. joint attention,
empathy, cooperation and self-recognition). Although
numerous contextual factors have been shown to predict
social cognition in young children, the genetic underpin-
nings of social-cognitive traits has been understudied
in this age group. Owing to the known effects of oxy-
tocin on adult social cognition and psychopathology,
this study hypothesized that variability in the oxytocin
receptor gene (OXTR) would be associated with social
cognition in children at 18 months. Participants con-
sisted of 350 children (182 males; 168 females) who were
part of an ongoing longitudinal study that aimed to
assess environmental and genetic contributions to chil-
dren’s cognitive and socio-emotional functioning. At 18
months, social cognition was measured using previously
validated and developmentally sensitive tasks assessing
children’s joint attention, empathy, cooperation and
self-recognition. Five potentially functional OXTR vari-
ants were genotyped: rs1042778, rs2254298, rs11131149,
rs237897 and rs237899. A family-based association
design was used to control for population admixture
and stratiﬁcation, and additional non-genomic covari-
ates were controlled. Results showed that variability in
rs11131149 was signiﬁcantly associated with social cog-
nition (P = 0.009), with more copies of the major allele
related to higher social cognition, and more copies of
the minor (risk) allele associated with lower social cog-
nition. A haplotype consisting of rs11131149–rs2254298
was also associated with social cognition (P = 0.020).
Implications for normative and pathological develop-
ment are discussed, and key areas for future research are
proposed.

Social cognition is the ability to understand the behavior of
other people – a process that relies on an individual’s proﬁ-
ciency at imputing the mental states of others. These cogni-
tive processes enable children to engage in a variety of social
behaviors that are critical to their psychosocial health and
development (Astington 2003). Moreover, there is a develop-
mental progression in social cognition across childhood, with
more rudimentary abilities in infancy (e.g. intention under-
standing) maturing into more sophisticated abilities in the
pre-school period (e.g. ‘theory of mind’; Wellman et al. 2008).
At around 18 months, a constellation of social skills emerge
that reﬂect children’s nascent ability to understand and repre-
sent the intentions of others, including joint attention, empa-
thy, cooperation and self-recognition (Nielsen & Dissanayake
2004; Warneken et al. 2006). Although there is a wealth of
evidence demonstrating the contribution of contextual fac-
tors to social cognition, few studies have explicitly examined
the neurobiological underpinnings of social cognition in young
children.

Recent reviews highlight the importance of the neuropep-
tide oxytocin (OXT) as a key modulator of human social
behavior (Skuse & Gallagher 2011). In adults, intranasal infu-
sion of OXT has been shown to improve emotion recog-
nition (Di Simplicio et al. 2009), empathic accuracy (Bartz
et al. 2010), trusting behavior (Kosfeld et al. 2005), generos-
ity (Barraza & Zak 2009), altruistic behavior (Zak et al. 2007),
cooperation (Declerck et al. 2010), eye gaze (Gamer et al.
2010) and the ability to infer others’ emotional states (Domes
et al. 2007). Although measured in adults, these pheno-
types parallel to those used to index children’s social cogni-
tion in this study – joint attention, empathy, cooperation and
self-recognition (see Wade et al. in press). Importantly, one
of the primary determinants of OXT functionality is the distri-
bution and expression of its receptor, coded by the oxytocin
receptor gene (OXTR; Gimpl & Fahrenholz 2001). To date,
molecular genetics studies have demonstrated associations
between OXTR single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
a variety of social-cognitive behaviors, including empathy
(Rodrigues et al. 2009), altruism (Israel et al. 2009), social
recognition (Skuse et al. 2013), prosocial temperament (Tost
et al. 2010) and theory of mind (Wu & Su 2013). Given these
associations, it is plausible that OXTR variation also relates to
emergent social-cognitive skills in 18-month-old children.

Although the functionality of OXTR SNPs remains unspec-
iﬁed, Mizumoto and colleagues (1997) have shown that the
third intronic region may be associated with transcriptional

suppression and downregulation of the gene through differ-
ential methylation patterns. Thus, in this study we examined
four SNPs within intron 3 because of their potential func-
tional role as modulators of genetic activity and social behav-
ior. These included rs2254298, rs11131149, rs237897 and
rs237899, which have also been implicated in human social
behavior vis-à-vis their association with autism spectrum dis-
order (ASD) and other psychiatric conditions characterized by
deﬁcits in social cognition (Jacob et al. 2007; Kawamura et al.
2010; Liu et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2005). We also genotyped
marker rs1042778, located in the 3′-untranslated region, due
to its potential regulatory role in OXTR transcription and trans-
lation (Israel et al. 2009). This marker has also been linked to
ASD (Campbell et al. 2011) and childhood psychopathology
(Malik et al. 2012). Together, these SNPs tag the major hap-
lotypes of OXTR, making them suitable candidates for the
analysis of social cognition in children. This study focused on
social cognition in the second year of life – a period of rapid
neurocognitive maturation. This is the earliest period at which
OXTR has been examined in relation to social-cognitive traits
in humans.

Material and methods

Participants
This study was part of an ongoing longitudinal study (Kids, Fam-
ilies, Places) that aimed to investigate genetic and environmental
inﬂuences on children’s cognitive and socio-emotional development
by examining within- and between-family differences. The study
design combined epidemiological methodology (large and diverse
sample, multiple siblings, home visits) with developmental method-
ology (tasks developed in the laboratory, detailed microsocial obser-
vational data). At wave 1 (youngest child was a newborn), 501 families
from Toronto and Hamilton were enlisted through Public Health Units.
Inclusion criteria included an English-speaking mother, a full-term
newborn weighing >1500 g, two or more children younger than
4-years-old, and agreement to be videotaped. Families were followed
up at wave 2, at which point the youngest child in each family was
about 18-months-old (Mage = 1.60 years; SD = 0.14). This was the tar-
get age for examining social cognition, and thus only the youngest
children were included in this study. Due to attrition, data were avail-
able for 397 of the original 501 children at wave 2. Of these 397 chil-
dren, no social-cognitive data was available for 24 of them, resulting
in 373 children contributing a score on the social cognition phenotype
(see below and Appendix S1). Of these 373 children, 350 were geno-
typed (see section on ‘Genotyping’ below), resulting in a ﬁnal sample
of 350 children for the genetic analysis. The University of Toronto
Research Ethics Board approved all procedures for this investigation,
and informed consent was attained from all participants.

We compared the study sample at wave 1 with the general
population of Toronto and Hamilton using 2006 Canada Census
Data. The study sample was similar to the general population in
terms of number of persons in the household (M = 4.52, SD = 1.01
vs. M = 4.13; SD = 1.22) and personal income ($30 000–$39 999 vs.
census population mean = $30 504.16, SD = $37 808.12); however,
the study sample had fewer non-intact families (lone-parent: 5% vs.
16.8%; step-families: 4.3% vs. 10.3%), fewer immigrants (47% vs.
57.7%) and more educated mothers (53% had a Bachelor’s degree
compared with 30.6% in the general population).

Procedure
Two trained interviewers visited each family’s residence for approx-
imately 2 h. During the visit, mothers were interviewed and com-
pleted questionnaires pertaining to demographics, family life and
child behavior. Mothers were also observed interacting with the

target children and their next-in-age sibling to attain measures of
parenting behavior. Children engaged in a variety of observational
tasks designed to assess multiple components of social cognition,
described below.

Measures
Social cognition
Social cognition was measured at wave 2 (18 months) as a factor
score of four independent observational tasks that were used
to assess children’s joint attention, empathy, cooperation and
self-recognition. Each of these tasks was based on previously vali-
dated and widely used laboratory tasks, which we administered in
the home. As data collectors had less control over the environment,
some children were missing data on tasks due to non-administration,
child noncompliance, lack of visibility (e.g. child went off camera), par-
ent intrusion (e.g. directing child’s attention) or tester administration
error (e.g. not following the standardized protocol). Table 1 presents
the Ns for each task. A complete description of these tasks is in
Appendix S1. Brieﬂy, in the joint attention task, children were required
to respond to an adult interviewer’s bids for directing their attention
(Mundy et al. 2003); in the empathy task, children were tasked with
responding to the feigned distress of the interviewer (Kochanska
et al. 1994);
in the cooperation tasks, children needed to work
collaboratively with the interviewer toward a shared goal (Warneken
et al. 2006); and in the self-recognition task, children were assessed
for their ability to recognize the objectivity of their body using the
mirror-rouge paradigm (Amsterdam 1972).
reliabilities
across tasks were: 𝛼 = 0.94 for joint attention, 𝛼 = 0.82 for empathy,
𝛼 = 0.86 for cooperation and 𝜅 = 0.79 for self-recognition. Scores on
these measures were submitted to a conﬁrmatory factor analysis
(CFA), consistent with their theoretical coherence (Wade et al. in
press). Full-information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML) was
used to account for missing data in the CFA model (Acock 2005;
Graham 2009). A maximum likelihood with robust standard errors
estimator (MLR) was used, which produces parameter estimates
with standard errors and a 𝜒 2 that are robust to non-normality when
missing data are present (Muthén & Muthén 2010). In accordance
with recommended cut-off values of Hu and Bentler (1999), model ﬁt
for the social cognition factor was excellent: root-mean-square-error
of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.023, comparative ﬁt index (CFI) = 0.99
and standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) = 0.021. Further,
all model-estimated loadings were positive and signiﬁcant at the
P < 0.001 level, suggesting that children’s social cognition at 18
months could be reliably represented as a factor indicated by joint
attention, empathy, cooperation and self-recognition. Factor scores
for each individual were extracted, saved and used as the outcome
phenotype in the genetic association analysis. The social cognition
factor was normally distributed with a mean of zero.

cognition (deﬁned both broadly and using this study’s narrow def-
inition), a number of variables were covaried with social cognition:
(1) children’s gender; (2) concurrent age; (3) children’s concurrent
language ability, measured using the MacArthur-Bates Commu-
nicative Development Inventories (CDI; Fenson et al. 1994);
(4)
family socio-economic status (SES), assessed via material education
and family income/assets and (5) maternal responsivity, used as a
metric of parenting behavior that has been shown to predict social
cognition. An in-depth description of these measures is also in
Appendix S1.

Genotyping
DNA was extracted from cheek swabs for 350 children (182 males;
168 females), 354 mothers and 244 fathers. On the basis of previ-
ous reports, we selected ﬁve SNPs in the OXTR gene by search-
ing for conﬁrmed polymorphisms in public databases (ABI database
and the NCBI SNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP) and
for pre-designed assays from Applied Biosystems (ABI, Foster City,
CA, USA, Assay-on-Demand by Applied Biosystems®). These SNPs
included rs1042778, rs2254298, rs11131149, rs237897 and rs237899
that, based on Hapmap, tagged the major haplotypes of the gene.
These markers were genotyped with the ABI 7900-HT Sequence
Detection System® (Applied Biosystems) using the TaqMan 5′ nucle-
ase assay for allelic discrimination. We also attempted to genotype a
sixth marker, rs53576, but this marker failed to genotype in >50% of
the sample in the ﬁrst round of genotyping. An attempt to retype this
marker was made, but it remained problematic and was thus dropped
from the present analysis. However, as noted in Hapmap, rs53576 is
in the same haplotype block as marker rs237897, which we success-
fully genotyped and used in the present analysis. Each SNP and its
genetic information for the entire sample are presented in Table 2. The
PCR reactions (10 μl volume) contained 30 ng of genomic DNA, 10 μM
of TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and
0.25 μl of allelic discrimination mix (Applied Biosystems) containing
36 μM of each primer and 8 μM of each probe. The thermal cycling con-
ditions were 50 ∘C for 2 min, 95 ∘C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 94 ∘C for 15 s and the annealing temperature of 60 ∘C for 1 min.
Each 96-well plate contained two negative controls. Plates were then
read on the ABI 7900HT Sequence Detection System (SDS) using the
allelic discrimination end-point analysis mode of SDS software pack-
age version 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). For the analyzed data, there
were no Mendelian errors. Extensive data checks were performed
that included retyping of any observed Mendelian errors until they
were resolved. Approximately 20% of the sample required a second
or third round of genotyping to resolve these errors. We also checked
for crossovers between markers, which is a sensitive check for geno-
typing errors.

Statistical analysis
The association analysis was carried out using the family-based
association test (FBAT) with the Golden Helix SVS program. The FBAT
statistic is a generalization of the transmission disequilibrium test
(TDT), in which the alleles transmitted to probands are compared
with the distribution of alleles expected among the offspring. In
the FBAT approach, the expected allele distributions are conditioned

on the parental genotypes and based on Mendelian transmissions.
Thus, unlike a typical case-control design, the FBAT technique uses
each child’s parents as pseudo-controls, thereby controlling for the
widespread confounds of population admixture and stratiﬁcation. In
contrast to a case-control design, the result of the FBAT analysis is
a robust and unbiased test statistic that, when signiﬁcant, allows
researchers to infer both association and linkage.
In this study,
we tested an additive model
in which genotypes were coded to
reﬂect the number of copies of each allele. The quantitative trait of
interest was the social cognition factor score described above. As
recommended by Lange, Laird and colleagues, a phenotypic residual
was used for the coded phenotype by offsetting each individual’s
score by the phenotypic mean, which has been shown to improve
the statistical power of the FBAT statistic (Lange et al. 2002). We
also controlled for non-genomic factors known to be associated
with the quantitative trait (i.e. social cognition) by adjusting the raw
measurements for important covariates in order to reduce outcome
variability and improve power (Laird & Lange 2008). Alpha was set at
P < 0.05.

Results

Table 1 presents key demographic variables of the sam-
ple (N = 350) at wave 1, including the number of children
born low birth weight (<2.5 kg) and number of children born
pre-term (<37 weeks gestation). Preliminary correlation anal-
ysis revealed that none of these wave 1 demographic char-
acteristics, nor birth weight or gestational age, was signiﬁ-
cantly associated with social cognition at 18 months (wave
2; all P’s > 0.10). Moreover, mean comparisons between low
birth weight vs. average birth weight children [t = 0.076,
P = 0.94], and preterm vs. term-born children [t = 0.074,
p = 0.94], revealed no differences in social cognition.

Table 3 reports the bivariate associations between study
variables, grouped into contextual variables (including covari-
ates) and child variables. Although the primary outcome
phenotype was the social cognition factor score, we have
included all four social-cognitive skills that made up this factor
(joint attention, empathy, cooperation and self-recognition)
for a more detailed descriptive analysis. As seen in Table 3,
the socio-economic variables showed little relation to any
of the social-cognitive measures, while maternal responsiv-
ity and child language were signiﬁcantly associated with the
social cognition factor and the individual skills that comprised
this factor. As expected, there were signiﬁcant inter-relations
among social-cognitive skill variables, and all were associ-
ated with the social cognition factor. All subsequent genetic
association analyses were conducted on the social cognition
factor.

We performed a preliminary multi-marker analysis by
combining all individual SNPs and pairwise correlations into
a single test of association. This test behaves similarly to
a global (omnibus) test of association, without examining
a speciﬁc haplotype structure (Rakovski et al. 2007). Using
the FBAT-GEE estimator, results showed a signiﬁcant asso-
ciation of the combined ﬁve-marker score and the social
cognition phenotype (P = 0.005), suggesting the presence
of a genetic association. To evaluate the speciﬁc nature
of this association, single SNP analyses were performed
using the same statistical parameters. Table 2 reports the
allele frequencies, the number of informative families (i.e.
families with at least one heterozygous parent), the P-value
of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the P-value of the FBAT
statistic, and the heritability coefﬁcient for each SNP. The
heritability coefﬁcient is a measure of the proportion of the
phenotypic variance explained by the analyzed marker. The
results indicated that we cannot reject the null hypothesis
of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium at standard levels of signiﬁ-
cance for all but one marker (rs1042778). FBAT analyses for
the ﬁve individual SNPs revealed that there was a signiﬁcant
association between the rs11131149 marker and social cogni-
tion (P = 0.009), which was robust to correction for multiple
comparisons. There was also a nominal association between
the rs237897 marker and social cognition (P = 0.018), but this
association did not survive correction for multiple testing.
None of the other markers showed signiﬁcant associations
with social cognition. For the rs11131149 marker,
it was
observed that more copies of the major allele (0 to 1 to 2
copies of G) were associated with higher levels of social
cognition, and more copies of the minor allele (0 to 1 to 2
copies of A) were associated with lower social cognition.
An examination of the heritability coefﬁcient showed that
approximately 1.6% of the variance in the social cognition
phenotype was explained by the rs11131149 marker.

We also conducted haplotype analysis using PBAT’s hap-
lotype function, which behaves similarly to the Haploview
program of Barrett et al. (2005). There was minimal linkage
disequilibrium (LD) between genotyped markers except the
single signiﬁcant SNP, rs11131149 and rs2254298, as well

as between rs237897 and rs237899 (D′ > 0.7 for both; see
Fig. 1). Haplotype tests of association for each of these
two-marker haplotypes revealed the following pattern of
results: For the rs237897–rs237899 haplotype, an A–G
allelic combination was shown to be associated with higher
social cognition (P = 0.010), although the proportion of
variability accounted for by this haplotype was extremely
small (h2 < 0.0001). For the rs11131149–rs2254298 haplo-
type, a G–G allelic combination was also associated with
higher social cognition (P = 0.035, h2 = 0.013), and an A–G
allelic combination was associated with lower social cog-
nition (P = 0.020, h2 = 0.036). None of these haplotypes
offered a statistical
the single SNP
association involving rs11131149 alone. Follow-up analyses
using the multi-marker FBAT-GEE showed that,
indeed,
any two-, three- or four-marker combination involving the
rs11131149 was signiﬁcantly associated with social cognition
(all P’s < 0.05). Thus, the rs11131149 marker appears to be
the SNP most robustly associated with social cognition at 18
months.

Discussion

The results of this study show that variability in OXTR is asso-
ciated with children’s social cognition in the second year of
life – a critical period of neurocognitive development during
which children’s understanding of others’ intentions supports
engagement in an array of social-cognitive behaviors (e.g.
joint attention, empathy, cooperation and self-recognition).
This ﬁnding supports a large body of literature delineating the
involvement of the oxytocin system in human social behav-
ior (Skuse & Gallagher 2011). Moreover, these results lend
support to the idea that variability in the OXTR gene is asso-
ciated with human-speciﬁc social-cognitive capacities such
as empathy (Rodrigues et al. 2009), prosocial engagement
(Israel et al. 2009), and theory of mind (Wu & Su 2013).
This study is the ﬁrst to demonstrate such an association in
18-month-old children, the stage at which these social behav-
iors and cognitions are beginning to emerge. That there is

et al. 2012). Moreover, OXT may indirectly promote encephal-
ization by tuning the human nervous system to socialization
factors that support brain growth and, by extension, human
cognition and sociality (Adolphs 2008; Carter 2014). Thus,
genetic and epigenetic variations in OXTR may contribute
to the genetic modulation of neocortical growth that begets
individual differences in social cognition (Carter 2014; Ebstein
et al. 2012; Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2011).

Social cognition – broadly deﬁned – is an important cog-
nitive endophenotype for many behavioral and psychiatric
conditions in children and adults (Buitelaar et al. 1999;
Hughes & Ensor 2006; Wang et al. 2008). In a previous
study of probands with attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disor-
der (ADHD), Park et al. (2010) demonstrated an association
between the OXTR SNP rs53576 and parent-reported mea-
sures of social behavior in 4- to 16-year-old children, including
social reciprocity, non-verbal skills, pragmatic language use
and functional impairment. Interestingly, there was no asso-
ciation between OXTR and the broad ADHD phenotype.
This study builds on these ﬁndings by showing that the
relationship between OXTR and social cognition extends to
18-month-old children within the normative range. Together,
these ﬁndings are interesting as they speak to a potential
relationship between genetic variability in OXTR and discrete
cognitive substrates that are impaired in complex disease
conditions. Indeed, studies demonstrating a link between
OXTR and particular disorders (e.g. ASD, ADHD, depres-
sion, etc.) may have been tapping into a more speciﬁc and
unmeasured relationship that involves impairments in social
cognition that typify these conditions (Lerer et al. 2007).
Future studies on the meditational role of social cognition in
linking genetic variability to neurodevelopmental and psychi-
atric problems would prove useful in elucidating the nature
of these intricate relationships.

In this study, variability in a speciﬁc SNP of OXTR,
rs11131149, was associated with social cognition at 18
months. No previous study has demonstrated the associa-
tion of this SNP with any social-cognitive phenotype using
either case-control or family-based methodology. However,
Liu et al. (2010) showed that the rs11131149 marker belonged
to a haplotype block that was linked to ASD classiﬁcation, and
a separate investigation showed an association between this
marker and depressive temperament (Kawamura et al. 2010).
Again, owing to the known social-cognitive deﬁcits of indi-
viduals with both unipolar and bipolar depression (Schenkel
et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2008) as well as ASD (Gallese 2006),
it is conceivable that variability in rs11131149 confers risk
not for psychopathology per se, but for the social-cognitive
impairments that underlie these various disorders.

Most studies examining the link between OXTR and
human behavior have implicated the rs53576 and rs2254298
markers in social outcomes, psychopathology and autism
(see Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2011). In the current study we
were unable to genotype rs53576 successfully. However,
there was a nominally signiﬁcant association between the
rs237897 SNP and social cognition that, based on Hapmap,
has been shown to be in the same haplotype block as
rs52576. Future studies capable of including rs52576 would
prove useful in determining its role in social-cognitive devel-
opment. With regard to rs2254298, this marker was not

continuity in social cognition from infancy to middle child-
hood supports the prospect that variability in OXTR may help
to shape the development of early social-cognitive abilities
that mature over developmental time. The present results
are particularly noteworthy given the difﬁculty in assess-
ing social-cognitive traits in young children using develop-
mentally sensitive observational tasks – the gold standard in
developmental research.

Social cognition undergoes a protracted development over
early childhood, in accordance with the rapid maturation of
frontal brain regions (Adolphs 2008; Petanjek et al. 2008). Var-
ious aspects of social cognition have been mapped onto dis-
tinct cortical areas, including the orbito-frontal cortex (Stone
et al. 1998), anterior cingulate and paracingulate cortex (Gal-
lagher & Frith 2003), and medial prefrontal areas (Spreng
et al. 2009). The link between OXTR and human social cogni-
tion can be considered in light of the role that OXT plays in the
development and expression of the human nervous system.
As noted above, the behavioral functions of OXT depend on
its capacity to bind its receptor. Interestingly, OXTR has been
found in non-human species to be distributed in several brain
regions known to support social cognition (Freeman et al.
2014; Vaccari et al. 1998). The localization of OXTR to these
cortical regions is suggestive that OXT may have played an
evolutionary role in the anatomical and functional organization
of these neural substrates (Carter 2014). In fact, it has been
reported that the physiological actions of OXT can actually
shape cortical development. In humans, the large neocortex
is primarily due to cortical tissues and neurons in prefrontal
brain regions. It has been suggested that the encephalization
of the neocortex may depend on OXT’s ability to encourage
stem cell differentiation into cortical cells, and possibly its
capacity to inhibit apoptosis of critical brain cells (Gutkowska
& Jankowski 2012). In adults, OXT has been shown to reduce
programmed cell death and facilitate neurogenesis (Leuner

shown to be individually associated social cognition in the
present study. However, rs11131149 has been shown in
previous studies to belong to the same haplotype block as
rs2254298 (Liu et al. 2010), and was shown in the present
analysis to be in linkage disequilibrium with this SNP. Indeed,
a haplotype involving rs11131149–rs2254298 was shown
to be associated with social cognition in this study. More-
over, it is interesting to note that the rs11131149 marker
is chromosomally located directly between rs2254298 and
rs53576. The proximity of rs11131149 to these adjacent
markers suggests that this set of SNPs (and perhaps others)
may all be involved in the pathophysiology of social cogni-
tion and/or disorders characterized by impairments in social
cognition.

Although the functionality of rs11131149 has not yet been
ﬂeshed out, Mizumoto et al. (1997) have shown that a spe-
ciﬁc motif of ca. 10–15 nucleotides close to the middle
of intron 3 of the OXTR gene binds nuclear suppression
proteins that may be involved in downregulation of this
gene. The rs11131149 marker appears to be localized either
near or within this small genomic fragment. However, the
absence of linkage between rs11131149 and known func-
tional variant rs237897 (Tansey et al. 2010) in the current
analysis, as well as the lack of knowledge about the func-
tionality of rs11131149, prevents us from knowing whether
this marker is a real causal variant of social cognition, of
whether another unknown variant in strong LD with this
SNP is responsible for variability in social cognition. Alterna-
tively, it is possible that a presently unidentiﬁed haplotype
(perhaps involving multiple SNPs, including those mentioned
above) is in fact the functional variant that drives differences
in social cognition. Future studies on the functionality of
OXTR variants will be critical in expanding our understanding
of the mechanism through which these markers contribute
to both normative and pathological
levels of social cogni-
tion.

This study showed that, for the rs11131149 marker, more
copies of the major allele (G) were associated with higher
levels of social cognition, whereas more copies of the minor
allele (A) were associated with lower levels of social cognition
after controlling for a number of contextual and demographic
variables known to be related to social cognition. More-
over, simultaneous inheritance of a G–G haplotype involving
rs11131149–rs2254298 (both major alleles) was associated
with higher social cognition, whereas an A–G haplotype was
associated with lower social cognition. Taken together, these
results suggest that the A allele of the rs11131149 marker
may be a risk allele for the development of social-cognitive
difﬁculties in childhood. Thus, something about this genetic
variant may be responsible for the low levels of social cog-
nition observed in some children, perhaps through genetic
suppression or modiﬁcation by other genetic elements or
environmental factors. Importantly, the proportion of variance
accounted for by this SNP was small, on the order of 1.6%.
Although consistent with estimates for the expected pro-
portion of variance explained by individual SNPs for quan-
titative traits (Plomin 2013), this ﬁnding is a reminder that
single gene variants should not be considered alone in the
etiology or pathogenesis of any disorder or behavioral phe-
notype. Given the known effects of social-environmental

inﬂuences on social cognition (Meins et al. 2002; Ruffman
et al. 2006), a systematic examination of OXTR-environment
interactions may prove useful in broadening our understand-
ing of the biopsychosocial mechanism of social-cognitive
development.

Limitations
Genetic association studies have been criticized for produc-
ing effects that are potentially spurious and study-speciﬁc.
Though it is desirable to demonstrate replication of genetic
associations across samples, this study was unable to con-
duct cross-study comparisons as we know of no other sam-
ple that contains data for OXTR and all four measures of
social cognition in this study. Future replication studies are
encouraged to enhance our understanding of the relation-
ship between OXTR and social cognition in early childhood.
Moreover, studies including the rs53576 SNP would be partic-
ularly informative given this variant’s widespread involvement
in human social behavior and psychopathology.
